The [[Federal government of the United States]] requires [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that receive federal anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] or anti-[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] funds to adopt an organization-wide policy opposing [[prostitution]] and [[Sex trafficking|sex-trafficking]]. This requirement, known as the '''anti-prostitution pledge''', has been in place since 2003.

The policy has been criticized as counterproductive, as it hampers enlisting those involved in the sex industry in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-says-law-cant-dictate-anti-aids-groups-speech/2013/06/20/1cf84846-d9bc-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_story.html|title=Supreme Court says law can't dictate anti-AIDS groups' speech|date=20 June 2013|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the requirement was only applied to foreign-based NGOs, but in 2005 the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began applying it to U.S.-based organizations as well, resulting in legal challenges on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. These challenges were ultimately successful before the Supreme Court, with the 2013 decision in the case ''[[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International]]''. The requirement remains in effect for foreign-based NGOs that receive U.S. funds.

==Legislation and implementation==
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced the five-year $15 billion [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] in January 2003; [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed it in May 2003 under the name "United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS, [[Tuberculosis]], and [[Malaria]] Act (Global AIDS Act)". The act identifies prostitution and sex trafficking as contributing to the spread of HIV and explicitly advances a new U.S. policy goal: the eradication of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The act states:
* "No funds ... may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds ... may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

In December 2003 Congress passed the [[Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act]] which provided for funding of anti-trafficking activities, subject to the following restrictions.
* "No funds ... may be used to promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution."
* "No funds ... may be used to implement any program ... through any organization that has not stated in either a grant application, a grant agreement, or both, that it does not promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216135913/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/61130.htm Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003], 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7110 (2003). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge language in both acts was authored by Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004]] amended the AIDS Authorization to exempt the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] and any [[United Nations]] agency from having to sign the anti-prostitution pledge.&lt;ref name=aa/&gt;

While the language of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had expressed First Amendment concerns.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/17/AR2005051701247.html U.S. Backs Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf Letter from Justice Department to Judiciary Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808195530/http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf |date=8 August 2009 }}, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General [[Daniel Levin (attorney)|Daniel Levin]] reversed this opinion,&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf Implementation of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 – Eligibility Limitation on the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex Trafficking.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910012240/http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, (9 June 2005). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A document issued by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in May 2005 sought to extend the pledge requirement to the large group of organizations that receive funding through the multilateral [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (to which the U.S. contributes). This was quickly overturned by US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Rationale and reactions==
In a February 2002 [[presidential directive|National Security Presidential Directive]], President George W. Bush wrote: "The United States opposes prostitution and any related activities, including pimping, pandering, and/or maintaining brothels as contributing to the phenomenon
of trafficking in persons. These activities are inherently harmful and dehumanizing. The United States Government's position is that these activities should not be regulated as a legitimate form of work for any human being."&lt;ref&gt;NSPD-22, 25 February 2002. Quoted in [http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf An Administration Priority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021095527/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf |date=21 October 2008 }}, U.S. Dept. of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a group of non-profit organizations including [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Save the Children]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy in a letter to US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge "makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these hard-to-reach groups" and it will "exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/20050518LTR.pdf Letter to President Bush], 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This was countered in August 2005 by a letter to the President supporting the policy, signed by over 100 groups, including the [[Christian Medical and Dental Associations|Christian Medical Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association of Evangelicals]], [[Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]], [[Sex Industry Survivors]], [[The Medical Institute]], [[The Salvation Army]], [[World Hope International]] and [[World Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28834.php|title=Over 100 Groups Urge Bush to Enforce Anti-Prostitution Policy to Aid Sexually Exploited Women and Children|work=Medical News TODAY|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the pledge requirement argued that prostitution is inherently harmful and needs to be abolished, rejected [[harm reduction]] approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/595392355.html|title=Christian Medical Association Lauds Anti-Prostitution Pledge Ruling|work=Christian News Wire|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held that legalized prostitution increases demand for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

In May 2005, the [[Brazil]]ian government turned down $40 million in anti-HIV/AIDS funding from the U.S. government because of the anti-prostitution pledge. Brazil's AIDS commissioner Pedro Chequer was quoted as saying "Sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?"&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050530/kaplan|title=Just Say Não|journal=The Nation|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge has been criticized as counterproductive, because projects that work with and support prostitutes are often seen as instrumental in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Brazilian anti-AIDS program, which employs prostitutes to hand out information and free condoms, is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/01/AR2006030102316.html|title=Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sonagachi]] Project is a prostitutes' cooperative in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], that supports [[sex workers' rights]] and works to stop the spread of HIV; it has received strong positive evaluations from both [[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Bank]], and has been cited by UNAIDS as a "best-practice" model of working with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/ProstitutionOathImplications.pdf Implications of U.S. Policy Restrictions for Programs Aimed at Commercial Sex Workers and Victims of Trafficking Worldwide], Center for Health and Gender Equity, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Weitzer]] has described the anti-prostitution pledge as a symptom of what he calls the "[[moral panic|moral crusade]]" against sex trafficking, resulting in a broad attack against all forms of commercial sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2007 |title=The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade |url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035(3)%20%20447-475.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Politics &amp; Society |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=447–475 |doi=10.1177/0032329207304319 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043556/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035%283%29%20%20447-475.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the policy juxtaposes the words "prostitution" and "sex trafficking"; it has been pointed out that it is important to clearly distinguish between these two concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2803%2913596-9/fulltext|author=Butcher K.|title=Confusion between prostitution and sex trafficking|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=361|pages=329–332|year=2003|pmid=12801757|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13596-9|issue=9373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all relevant organizations already strongly oppose sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e207 EP –|last=Masenior|first=Nicole Franck|author2=Chris Beyrer|title=The US Anti-Prostitution Pledge: First Amendment Challenges and Public Health Priorities|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=1 July 2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040207|pmid=17676943|pmc=1925124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randall L. Tobias]], the U.S. administration's foreign aid chief who was responsible for implementation of the anti-prostitution pledge, resigned in April 2007 over allegations that he had used an [[escort service]]. Some sex worker organizations and commentators called the situation "ironic" and Tobias "hypocritical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html The Anti-Prostitution Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219100932/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html |date=19 December 2008 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/29/ex_aids_chief_in_escort_flap_called_hypocritical/ Ex-AIDS chief in escort flap called hypocritical], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 29 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 final report of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]'s Global Commission on HIV and the Law denounced the anti-prostitution pledge and included the recommendation
{{quote|text=3.2.8 Repeal punitive conditions in official development assistance—such as the United States government's PEPFAR anti-prostitution pledge and its current anti-trafficking regulations—that inhibit sex workers' access to HIV services or their ability to form organisations in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Global Commission on HIV and the Law|title=Final Report|url=http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&amp;Health-EN.pdf|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lawsuits===
In response to the 2005 decision to apply the policy also to U.S.-based organizations, two lawsuits were filed, alleging that the policy compels or prohibits speech in violation of the First Amendment, and also prohibits actions that are exclusively privately funded.

In the first case (''DKT v. USAID''), the non-profit [[DKT International]] prevailed in [[United States district court|District Court]] but lost on appeal, at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit]]. The February 2007 appeals court ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution as long as it is done through an affiliate that doesn't receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in [http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517062512/http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf |date=17 May 2008 }}. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The second case (''AOSI v. USAID'') involved the plaintiffs [[Alliance for Open Society International]], its affiliate the [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Pathfinder International]]. In May 2006, a District Court in New York issued a [[preliminary injunction]], preventing the government from requiring these organizations to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed this injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court]]. During the oral arguments in the case, the government stated that it would allow legally and physically separate affiliates to engage in the prohibited speech.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Appeals Court rebuffed the government and let the preliminary injunction stand, returning the case to the District Court. [[Global Health Council]] and [[InterAction]] joined the case, and the District Court extended the injunction to all U.S.-based members of these organizations in August 2008. The Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision in July 2011, affirmed the injunction and held that the anti-prostitution policy requirement "likely violates the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/aosi_v_usaid  ''AOSI v. USAID'' resources], [[Brennan Center for Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110713031758/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/11e51f0b-8781-4661-b383-d5d3dc77096b/2/doc/08-4917_complete_opn.pdf Alliance for Open Society International v. U.S. Agency for International Development], Appeals Court decision, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] obtained a ruling forcing the Department of Justice's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] to hand over the original February 2004 memorandum which had argued that the pledge, as applied to U.S.-based organizations, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. must show anti-prostitution pledge memo for HIV groups: court|date=19 September 2012|work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/09_-_September/U_S__must_show_anti-prostitution_pledge_memo_for_HIV_groups__court/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court [[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|ruled]] in 2013 that the anti-prostitution pledge violated the First Amendment: the government may not leverage funding to regulate grant recipient's speech outside of the funded program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency for Int'l Dev. v.

The '''''Belgian Linguistic case (No. 2)''''' (1968) [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695402&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 1 EHRR 252] is a formative case on the [[right to education]] under the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], Protocol 1, art 2. It related to "certain aspects of the laws on the use of [[languages of Belgium|languages]] in [[education in Belgium]]",  was decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1968.

==Facts==
The applicants submitted six applications (Applications No: 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64) between 1962 and 1964 on their own behalf and on the behalf of their  children, alleging that Belgian linguistic legislation, relating to education, infringed on their rights under the  European Convention, namely [[Article 8 ECHR|Article 8]] (family life) in conjunction with Article 14 (non-discrimination), and Article 2 of the Protocol 1 (right to education) of March 1952. 
The Acts they brought litigation against basically stated the language of education shall be [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the Dutch-speaking region, [[French language|French]] in the French-speaking region and [[German language|German]] in the German-speaking region.

===Counsel submissions===
The applicants, whose children totalled more than 800, asserted that the law of the Dutch-speaking regions where they lived did not include adequate provisions for French-language education. They also complained that the Belgian state withheld grants from institutions in these regions that did not comply with the linguistic provisions set out in the legislation for schools and refused to homologate certificates issued by these institutions.  Further, the state did not allow the applicants’ children to attend French classes in certain places,  forcing  applicants  to  enrol  their  children  in  local  schools,  contrary  to their aspirations, or send them further afield, which entailed risks and hardships.

The Government argued that the right to education in one’s own language was not included in the Convention and the Protocol, and that the applicants did not belong to a national minority within the meaning of Article 14.

==Judgment==
The Court found by a majority of 8 to 7 that one of the Acts violated Art 14. But the Court also found unanimously that there had been no breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, and Article 2 of the protocol, with regard to the other contested legislation and points at issue. In reaching its decision the Court considered that the principle of equality of treatment enshrined in Article 14 was violated if the distinction had no objective and reasonable justification, did not pursue a legitimate aim, and was not proportionate to the aim pursued. Further to this, the Court opined that the right to education implied the right to be educated in the national language, and did not include the provision that the parent’s linguistic preferences be respected.

The operative part of the Court's judgment read as follows.

{{Cquote|2.  The Court will address itself first to Article 2 of the Protocol because the Contracting States made express provision with reference to the right to education in this Article.

3.  By the terms of the first sentence of this Article, 'no person shall be denied the right to education'.

In spite of its negative formulation, this provision uses the term 'right' and speaks of a 'right to education'. Likewise the preamble to the Protocol specifies that the object of the Protocol lies in the collective enforcement of 'rights and freedoms'. There is therefore no doubt that Article 2 does enshrine a right. It remains, however, to determine the content of this right and the scope of the obligation it places upon States.

The negative formulation indicates, as is confirmed by the preparatory work, that the Contracting Parties do not recognise such a right to education as would require them to establish at their own expense, or to subsidise, education of any particular type or at any particular level. However, it cannot be concluded from this that the State has no positive obligation to ensure respect for such a right as is protected by Article 2 of the Protocol. As a 'right' does exist, it is secured, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, to everyone within the jurisdiction of a Contracting State.

To determine the scope of the 'right to education', within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Court must bear in mind the aim of this provision. It notes in this context that all member States of the Council of Europe possessed, at the time of the opening of the Protocol to their signature, and still do possess, a general and official educational system. There neither was, nor is now, therefore, any question of requiring each State to establish such a system, but merely of guaranteeing to persons subject to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties the right, in principle, to avail themselves of the means of instruction existing at a given time.

The Convention lays down no specific obligations concerning the extent of these means and the manner of their organisation or subsidisation. In particular, the first sentence of Article 2 does not specify the language in which education must be conducted in order that the right to education should be respected. It does not contain precise provisions similar to those in Articles 5(2) and 6(3)(a) and (e). However, the right to education would be meaningless if it did not imply, in favour of its beneficiaries, the right to be educated in the national language or in one of the national languages, as the case may be.

4.  The first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol consequently guarantees, in the first place, a right of access to educational institutions existing at a given time, but such access constitutes only a part of the right to education. For the 'right to education' to be effective, it is further necessary that, inter alia, the individual who is the beneficiary should have the possibility of drawing profit from the education received, that is to say, the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State, and in one form or another, official recognition of the studies he has completed. The Court will deal with this matter in greater detail when it examines the last of the six specific questions listed in the submissions of those who appeared before it.

5.  The right to education guaranteed by the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation that may vary in time and place according to needs and resources of the community and of individuals. It goes without saying that such regulation must never injure the substance of the right to education nor conflict with other rights enshrined in the Convention.

The Court considers that the general aim set for themselves by the Contracting Parties through the medium of the European Convention on Human Rights was to provide effective protection of fundamental human rights, and this, without doubt, not only because of the historical context in which the Convention concluded, but also of the social and technical developments in our age that offer States considerable possibilities for regulating the exercise of these rights. The Convention therefore implies a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights while attaching particular importance to the latter....

7.  The first sentence of Article 2 contains in itself no linguistic requirement. It guarantees the right of access to educational establishments existing at a given time and the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State and, in one form or another, the official recognition of completed studies, this last right not being relevant to the point dealt with here."}}

==Minors==
{{see also|Corporal punishment in the home|School corporal punishment}}
English [[common law]] allowed parents and others who have "lawful control or charge" of a child to use "moderate and reasonable" chastisement or correction. In the 1860 [[Eastbourne manslaughter]] case, [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Alexander Cockburn]] as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] ruled: "By the law of England, a parent ... may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child, inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable." It was left to the courts to decide what is meant by "moderate and reasonable" in any particular case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights of parents, guardians and teachers, in regard to the chastisement of children, were expressly recognized in English law by the [[Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act]] 1904 (§ 28). A master had a right to inflict moderate chastisement upon his [[apprentice]] for neglect or other misbehaviour, provided that he did so himself, and that the apprentice was under age (Archbold, Cr. Pl., 23rd ed., 795).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"&gt;{{ EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Corporal Punishment |volume=7 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] enables parents to justify [[common assault]] or [[battery (crime)]] of their children as "reasonable punishment", but prevents the defence being used in relation to [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (i.e. when causing anything beyond "transient and trifling" such as bruising) and any more serious harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law in the Republic of Ireland]], the [[rule of law]] allowing "physical chastisement" by teachers was abolished in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/26/section/24/enacted/en/html#sec24|title=Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, Section 24|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the common-law defence of "reasonable chastisement" by parents and guardians was abolished in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century in the [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-115.htm William Blackstone. Commentaries on the Laws of England]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The husband also (by the old law) might give his wife moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for her misbehaviour, the law thought it reasonable to entrust him with the power of restraining her, by domestic chastisement.... But, with us, in the politer reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles the Second]], this power of correction began to be doubted: and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband; or, in return, a husband against his wife....Yet the lower rank of people, who were always fond of the old common law, still claim and exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehavior.}}

In the UK the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate corporal punishment on his wife in order to keep her "within the bounds of duty" was similarly removed in 1891.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |title=R. v Jackson [1891] 1 QB 671, (abstract) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907012332/http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |archive-date=7 September 2014 |website=LawTeacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, courts in the United States overruled the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, R. "Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults", in ''Violence in the family'' (Suzanne K. Steinmetz and Murray A. Straus, eds.), Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1974. {{ISBN|0-396-06864-2}} p.

[[File:4 bit counter.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|The circuit diagram for a four-bit [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] counter, a type of [[state machine]]]]

A '''circuit diagram''' ('''electrical diagram''', '''elementary diagram''', '''electronic schematic''') is a graphical representation of an [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]]. A [[pictorial]] circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a [[schematic diagram]] shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. The presentation of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/cdiags.htm Circuit diagrams and component layouts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a [[block diagram]] or [[Integrated circuit layout|layout diagram]], a circuit diagram shows the actual [[electrical connection]]s. A drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called ''artwork'' or ''[[Integrated circuit layout|layout]]'', ''physical design'', or ''[[wiring diagram]]''.

Circuit diagrams are used for the design ([[circuit design]]), construction (such as [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] layout), and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

In [[computer science]], circuit diagrams are useful when visualizing expressions using [[Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzfeld|first=Noreen|title=Computer Concepts and Applications|year=2012|publisher=College of Saint Benedict/St. John's University|location=Minnesota|pages=9[6]-9[12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
{{Main|Electronic symbol}}
Circuit diagrams are pictures with symbols that have differed from country to country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a [[inductor|coil]]. These wirewound resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from ''carbon composition'' (a mixture of [[carbon]] and [[Filler (materials)|filler]]) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in [[ohm]]s written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks on one side of the line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.

[[File:Wire Crossover Symbols for Circuit Diagrams.png|500px|thumb|'''Wire Crossover Symbols for Circuit Diagrams.''' The [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] symbol for insulated crossing wires is the same as the older, non-CAD symbol for non-insulated crossing wires. To avoid confusion, the wire "jump" (semi-circle) symbol for insulated wires in non-CAD schematics is recommended (as opposed to using the CAD-style symbol for no connection), so as to avoid confusion with the original, older style symbol, which means the exact opposite. The newer, recommended style for 4-way wire connections in both CAD and non-CAD schematics is to stagger the joining wires into T-junctions.&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Symbols|url=http://electronicsclub.info/circuitsymbols.htm|website=electronicsclub.info|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The linkages between leads were once simple crossings of lines.  With the arrival of computerized drafting, the connection of two intersecting wires was shown by a crossing of wires with a "dot" or "blob" to indicate a connection. At the same time, the crossover was simplified to be the same crossing, but without a "dot". However, there was a danger of confusing the wires that were connected and not connected in this manner, if the dot was drawn too small or accidentally omitted (e.g. the "dot" could disappear after several passes through a copy machine).&lt;ref&gt;
"It is good practice to never use a + connection with a dot. Why? The dot can disappear when the schematic is copied for the 12th time." --
[http://www.siteswithstyle.com/VoltSecond/Schematic_notes/Schematic_reading_notes.html "Notes on Reading Schematics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008031902/http://www.siteswithstyle.com/VoltSecond/Schematic_notes/Schematic_reading_notes.html |date=2011-10-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the modern practice for representing a 4-way wire connection is to draw a straight wire and then to draw the other wires staggered along it with "dots" as connections (see diagram), so as to form two separate T-junctions that brook no confusion and are clearly not a crossover.&lt;ref&gt;
"We recommend against using a 4-way connection point ... To avoid confusion, use only three-way connections." --
[http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/mech307/project_report_samples/GF_Guidelines_8.pdf "Design News Gadget Freak Submission Guidelines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929002946/http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/mech307/project_report_samples/GF_Guidelines_8.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Wires connected at 'crossroads' should be staggered slightly to form two T-junctions" --
[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/symbol.htm "The Electronics Club: Circuit Symbols"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

For crossing wires that are insulated from one another, a small semi-circle symbol is commonly used to show one wire "jumping over" the other wire&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info" /&gt;&lt;ref name="circuitstoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Circuit Symbols |url=http://www.circuitstoday.com/electronic-circuit-symbols |website=www.circuitstoday.com |accessdate=2 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013185140/http://www.circuitstoday.com/electronic-circuit-symbols |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicshub.org/symbols/ Electronics Circuit Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to how jumper wires are used).

A common, hybrid style of drawing combines the T-junction crossovers with "dot" connections and the wire "jump" semi-circle symbols for insulated crossings. In this manner, a "dot" that is too small to see or that has accidentally disappeared can still be clearly differentiated from a "jump".&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "circuitstoday" /&gt;

On a circuit diagram, the [[electronic symbol|symbols]] for components are labelled with a descriptor or [[reference designator]] matching that on the list of parts. For example, C1 is the first [[capacitor]], L1 is the first [[inductor]], Q1 is the first [[transistor]], and R1 is the first [[resistor]]. Often the value or type designation of the component is given on the diagram beside the part, but detailed specifications would go on the parts list.

Detailed rules for reference designations are provided in the International standard [[IEC 61346]].

==Organization==
It is a usual although not universal convention that schematic drawings are organized on the page from left to right and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path.  For example, a schematic for a radio receiver might start with the antenna input at the left of the page and end with the loudspeaker at the right.  Positive power supply connections for each stage would be shown towards the top of the page, with grounds, negative supplies, or other return paths towards the bottom.  Schematic drawings intended for maintenance may have the principal signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit.   More complex devices have multi-page schematics and must rely on cross-reference symbols to show the flow of signals between the different sheets of the drawing.

Detailed rules for the preparation of circuit diagrams, and other document types used in electrotechnology, are provided in the international standard [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[IEC 61082|61082-1]].

[[Relay logic]] line diagrams, also called [[ladder logic]] diagrams, use another common standardized convention for organizing schematic drawings, with a vertical power supply rail on the left and another on the right, and components strung between them like the rungs of a ladder.

==Artwork==
[[File:Rats nest diagram.JPG|right|thumbnail|A rat's nest]]
Once the schematic has been made, it is converted into a layout that can be fabricated onto a printed circuit board (PCB). [[Schematic-driven layout]] starts with the process of [[schematic capture]]. The result is what is known as a rat's nest. The rat's nest is a jumble of wires (lines) criss-crossing each other to their destination nodes. These wires are routed either manually or automatically by the use of electronics design automation (EDA) tools. The EDA tools arrange and rearrange the placement of components and find paths for tracks to connect various nodes. This results in the final [[Integrated circuit layout|layout]] artwork for the [[integrated circuit]] or [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref&gt;

A generalized design flow may be as follows:
:Schematic → schematic capture → [[netlist]] → rat's nest → [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] → artwork → PCB development and etching → component mounting → testing

==Education==
Teaching about the functioning of electrical circuits is often on primary and secondary school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Bitesize. Circuits. https://www.bbc.com/education/topics/zq99q6f&lt;/ref&gt; Students are expected to understand the rudiments of circuit diagrams and their functioning. Use of diagrammatic representations of circuit diagrams can aid understanding of principles of electricity. 

Principles of the physics of circuit diagrams are often taught with the use of analogies, such as comparing functioning of circuits to other closed systems such as water heating systems with pumps being the equivalent to batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. D., &amp; Garlovsky, D. (2016). Going with the flow: Using analogies to explain electric circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10288">In [[ethics]], two [[value theory|value]]s (or [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], [[practical reason|reasons]], or [[good and evil|goods]]) are '''incommensurable''' (or incommensurate, or incomparable) when they do not share a common standard of measurement or cannot be compared to each other in a certain way.

There is a cluster of related ideas, and many philosophers use the terms differently. On one common usage:  
* Two '''values''' (for example, freedom and security) are ''incommensurable'' when they cannot be 'traded off' against each other: for example, if there is no set amount of freedom that would compensate for a certain loss of security, or vice versa.  
* Two '''options or choices''' are ''incommensurate'' or ''incomparable'' if and only if: it is not true that one is better, that the other is better, or that they are exactly equally good.  
This page is concerned almost entirely with the second phenomenon. For clarity, the term 'incomparable' is used.

== Trichotomous Comparisons and Small Improvement Arguments ==
In terminology due to [[Ruth Chang]], the three ''trichotomous comparisons'' are betterness, worseness, and equal goodness. For example, one artist, drawing, or cup of coffee might be better or worse than another, or precisely equally as good as it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Ruth|date=2002-07-01|title=The Possibility of Parity|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/339673|journal=Ethics|volume=112|issue=4|pages=659–688|doi=10.1086/339673|issn=0014-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two items are incomparable, none of the trichotomous comparisons holds between them (or at least it seems that way).

The clearest way of arguing that two options are incomparable is a '''small improvement argument.'''

The purpose of such examples is to show that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply. Here is an example. Suppose that (for you, taking everything into account), a certain job as a professor and a certain job as a banker are such that neither seems better than the other. The professor job offers more freedom and security, and the banking job offers more money and excitement. But we might say that though they are good in different ways, they are just too different to be compared with one of the trichotomous comparisons.

Let's suppose that this means that the banking job is not better, and the professor job is not better. This seems to rule out two of the three trichotomous comparisons.

But what about the third? Might the jobs be exactly equally good? The small improvement argument is supposed to show that they could not. Suppose for the sake of argument that they ''are'' precisely equally good.

Suppose also that in order to tempt you, the bankers offer you a tiny pay rise, perhaps 5 cents a year. This new banking job (often called 'banking+') is clearly better than banking, albeit only by a tiny amount. You could (under normal circumstances) never rationally choose banking over banking+: they are the same in every way, except that the latter pays more.

Here is the crux of the small improvement argument: if banking is exactly equally as good as professor, and banking+ is better than banking, then banking+ must be better than professor. But this seems very implausible: if banking and professor were so different that we could not say that professor is better, and we could not say that banking is better, then how could adding 5 cents a year to a huge salary make the difference?

This seems to show that one of our assumptions was incorrect. Defenders of incomparability will say it is most plausible that the assumption that banking and philosophy are equally good that is incorrect. So they conclude that this assumption as false, and thus that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply.

== Theories of Incommensurability ==
There are four main philosophical accounts of incommensurability/incomparability. Their task is to explain (or explain away) the phenomenon, and the small improvement argument. Some philosophers are pluralists about the phenomenon: they think that (for example) genuine incomparability might be the correct account in some cases, and parity in others.

One way to understand the difference between the theories is to see how they respond to the small-improvement argument.

=== Epistemicism about incomparability ===
One possibility is that this is all a mistake: that '''there is no genuine incomparability''', and when it seems like none of the three trichotomous comparisons apply, in fact one of them does but we do not know which. This is where the small-improvement argument goes wrong: one of the trichotomous comparisons ''does'' apply between banking and philosophy.

According to this view, apparent incomparability is merely ignorance. An advantage of this account is that the various puzzles surrounding incomparability dissolve rather quickly. Choice between incomparable options is no more than choice between options when we do not know which is better.

The main objection to this kind of view is that it seems very implausible, for similar reasons to [[Epistemicism|epistemicism about vagueness]]. In particular, it is hard to see how we could be ignorant of the kinds of facts involved in incomparability.

=== Genuine Incomparability ===
Joseph Raz has argued that in cases of incomparability, '''no comparison applies'''. Neither option is better, and they are not equally good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raz|first=Joseph|date=1985|title=Value Incommensurability: Some Preliminaries|jstor=4545040|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=86|pages=117–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this view, the small-improvement argument is sound.

=== Parity ===
Ruth Chang has argued that (at least some of the time), options may be '''comparable even if they are not trichotomously comparable'''. She does this by denying that the three trichotomous comparisons are the only ones on offer. She defends the existence of a fourth comparison, which she calls 'parity'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Luke Elson has criticised this argument, claiming that the apparent possibility of parity is really an artefact of the vagueness of the (trichotomous) comparisons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elson|first=Luke|date=2014-04-01|title=Heaps and Chains: Is the Chaining Argument for Parity a Sorites?|url=https://sites.google.com/view/luke-elson/|journal=Ethics|volume=124|issue=3|pages=557–571|doi=10.1086/674844|issn=0014-1704|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incomparability as Vagueness ===
Finally, a set of philosophers led by [[John Broome (philosopher)|John Broome]] has argued that incomparability is [[vagueness]]. This theory says that it is vague or indeterminate which trichotomous comparison applies.

The argument for this position is complex, and how 'incomparability as vagueness' is to be understood depends on one's theory of vagueness. But the main idea behind the theory is fairly simple. What is the ''precise'' minimum number of grains of sand needed to count as a heap, or hairs required to count as non-bald? If there is no precise number, only a rough range, then these are instances of vagueness. On one set of theories of vagueness, it is ''indeterminate'' how many heaps or hairs are required. Perhaps our language simply does not specify a sharp boundary.

In the small-improvement argument, the incomparability as vagueness view might say that it is indeterminate whether banking is better or worse than philosophy, or precisely equally good.

One taxonomic complication is distinguishing the view that incomparability is vagueness, combined with epistemicism about vagueness, from epistemicism about incomparability.

== Philosophical Implications of Incomparability ==
Incomparability has figured prominently in several philosophical debates concerning moral and rational action. In general, incomparability can add complications to any view according to which one ought to do the best thing that one can, or the better of two options. If the options are incomparable, it may be that neither is better. (Depending on which view of incomparability is true.)

=== Morality ===
[[Consequentialism|Consequentialists]] think that the morally right thing to do is what promotes the most overall good. But if two actions produce incomparable outcomes, it may be that neither is better.

The topic of incommensurability has also frequently arisen in discussions of the version of [[natural law]] theory associated with [[John Finnis]] and others.

=== Rational Choice ===
[[Joseph Raz]] has argued that incommensurability undermines the 'rationalistic' view of human action according to which distinctively rational action is doing what one has most reason to do.&lt;ref&gt;'Incommensurability and Agency' in the Chang book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical reflection about [[practical reason]] typically aims for a description of the principles relevant in answering the question, "What is to be done in this or that circumstance?" On one popular view, answers to this question can be found by comparing the relative strengths of the various values or norms in play in some given situation. For example, if one is trying to decide on some nice afternoon whether they should stay in to do work or go for a walk, on this view of practical reason they will compare the merits of these two options. If going for a walk is the better or more reasonable course of action, they should put aside their books and go for a stroll. The topic of incommensurability—and the topic of incomparability in particular—is especially important to those who advocate this view of practical reason. For if one's options in certain circumstances are of incomparable value, he or she cannot settle the question of what to do by choosing the better option. When the competing options are incomparable, then by definition neither is better than the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">During the [[Edo period]], [[Japan]] used various punishments against criminals. These can be categorized as follows:

* [[Capital punishment|Death penalty]]
* [[Prison|Incarceration]] and [[Exile]]
* [[Penal labor]]
* [[Confiscation]] of [[property]]
* [[Corporal punishment]]

== Death penalty  ==

Serious crimes such as [[murder]] and [[arson]] were punished by death. The [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] maintained execution grounds for Edo at [[Kozukappara execution grounds|Kozukappara]], [[Suzugamori execution grounds|Suzugamori]], and [[Itabashi execution grounds|Itabashi]]. Kozukappara, also known as Kotsukappara or Kozukahara, is currently located near the southwest exit of Tokyo's [[Minami-Senju Station]]. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 people were executed here. Only part of the site remains, located next to Emmeiji temple, partly buried under the rail tracks and under a more-recent burial ground. Archaeological and morphological research was done by [[Tokyo University]] on the skulls found buried here which confirmed the execution methods. Another notable one was located at Suzugamori in Shinagawa. Both sites are still sparsely commemorated ''in situ'' with memorial plaques and tombstones.

The shogunate executed criminals in various ways:

* [[Boiling to death|Boiling]]
* [[Execution by burning|Burning]]
* [[Crucifixion]] for killing a parent, husband etc.
* [[Decapitation]] by [[Katana|sword]]
* [[Sawing (torture)|Sawing]]
* Waist-cutting (cutting the person in half). The Kanazawa [[Han (Japan)|han]] coupled this with decapitation.

The death penalty often carried collateral punishments. One was parading the criminal around town prior to execution. A similar one was public display of the criminal prior to execution. A third was public display of the severed head.

[[Samurai]] were often sentenced to commit [[seppuku]] in lieu of these forms of punishment. Seppuku is a term of suicide for the samurai.

== Incarceration and exile ==
Depending on the severity of the crime, magistrates could sentence convicts to incarceration in various forms:
* Exile to an [[island]]. Criminals in [[Edo]] were often confined on [[Hachijōjima]] or [[Miyakejima]]. Criminals so punished received [[tattoo]]s.
* [[Imprisonment]]. The government of Edo maintained a jail at Kodenma-chō.

Exclusion from the location of the crime was a penalty for both commoners and samurai.
* Tokoro-barai, banishment to a certain distance, was common for non-samurai.
* Kōfu kinban, assignment to the post of [[Kofu, Yamanashi|K&amp;#333;fu]] in the mountains west of Edo, is an example of rustication of samurai.

== Penal labor ==
For crimes requiring moderate punishment, convicts could be sent to work at labor camps such as the one on Ishikawa-jima in [[Tokyo Bay|Edo Bay]]. More serious acts could result in being sent to work in the [[gold]] [[Mining|mine]] on the island of [[Sado Island|Sado]]. In 1590, Hideyoshi had banned "unfree labor" or [[slavery]]; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor.  For example, the Edo period penal laws prescribed "non-free labor" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common.  The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=hideyoshi+slavery&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9P9o262Fpo&amp;sig=TKN79q0hnoLMEP8UbZk2fdmq00I&amp;hl=en#PPA31,M1  ''Frontier Contact Between Choson Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' p. 31]–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common for female convicts to be sentenced to serve terms working as slaves and prostitutes in walled [[Red Light District]]s, most notably [[Yoshiwara]].

== Confiscation ==
A penalty that targeted [[merchant]]s especially was kesshō, the confiscation of a business.

== Corporal punishment ==
[[Handcuffs|Handcuffing]] allowed the government to punish a criminal while he was under [[house arrest]]. Depending on the severity of the crime, the sentence might last 30, 50, or 100 days.

[[Flagellation]] was a common penalty for crimes such as [[theft]] and [[fight]]ing. [[Amputation]] of the nose or ears replaced flogging as penalty early in the Edo period. The 8th Shōgun of Edo, [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] introduced judicial Flogging Penalty, or ''tataki'', in 1720.  A convicted criminal could be sentenced to a maximum of 100 lashes.  ''[[Samurai]]'' and priests were exempt from flogging, and the penalty was applied only to commoners. The convict was stripped of all outer clothing and struck about the buttocks and back. The flogging penalty was used until 1867, though it fell out of favor from 1747 to 1795 intermittently.  Both men and women could be sentenced to a flogging, though during one segment of the mid-Edo period, women were imprisoned rather than flogged.&lt;ref&gt;Nawa Yumio "Torture and Penalty in Japan"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of flogging penalty===
In 757 A.D., the Chinese-influenced Yoro Ritsuryo (養老律令) legal system was enacted and introduced Five Judicial Penalties (五刑).  Two of the Five Judicial Penalties involved Flogging.  Light Flogging provided for 10 to 50 lashes, while Heavy 
Flogging stipulated 60 to 100 strokes.  However, a slave could be sentenced to up a maximum of 200 lashes.  These flogging penalties only applied to male commoners.  Convicts of the nobility, along with female commoners, might be sentenced to the imposition of handcuffs or a fine.  When a convicted criminal was flogged, half the number of lashes were typically applied to the back, half to the buttocks. At times, if the convict's request to change the lash target was sanctioned then the lashes would be applied only to the back or to the buttocks.  By the [[Sengoku period|Age of Warring States]], flogging had been largely replaced by [[decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Im Myung-Su "Torture and Punishment in Edo period"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DART'''  ('''Discrete anisotropic radiative transfer''') is a 3D [[radiative transfer]] [[3D modelling|model]], designed for scientific research, in particular [[remote sensing]]. Developed at CESBIO since 1992, DART model was patented in 2003. It is freeware for scientific activities.

== General Description ==
DART model simulates, simultaneously in several wavelengths of the optical domain (e.g., visible and thermal infrared), the radiative budget and remotely sensed images of any Earth scene (natural / urban with /without relief), for any sun direction, any atmosphere, any view direction and any sensor FTM. It was designed to be precise, easy to use and adapted for operational use. For that, it simulates:  
*Terrestrial landscape.
*The atmosphere (optional simulation).
*The space or airborne radiometric sensor (optional simulation).

It simulates any landscape as a 3D matrice of cells that contain turbid material and triangles. Turbid material is used for simulating vegetation (e.g., tree crowns, grass, agricultural crops,…) and the atmosphere. Triangles are used for simulating translucent and opaque surfaces that makes up topography, urban elements and 3D vegetation. DART can use structural and spectral data bases (atmosphere, vegetation, soil,…). It includes a [[LIDAR]] simulation mode.

=== General Information On Radiative Transfer ===
The approaches used to simulate radiative transfer differ on 2 levels: mathematical method of resolution and mode of representation of the propagation medium. These two levels are in general dependent. The models of radiative transfer are often divided into 2 categories associated with the 2 principal modes of representation of the landscape: homogeneous or heterogeneous representation. For the models known as homogeneous (Idso and of Wit, 1970; Ross, 1981; Verhoef, 1984; Myneni et al., 1989), the landscape is represented by a constant horizontal distribution of absorbing and scattering elements (sheets, branches, etc...). On the other hand, for the  models known as heterogeneous, the landscape is represented by a no uniform space distribution of unspecified elements of the landscape (North, 1996; Govaerts, 1998).

=== Simulation of the "Earth - Atmosphere" scene ===
DART simulates radiative transfer in the "Earth-Atmosphere" system, for any wavelength in the optical domain (shortwaves : visible, thermal infrared,…). Its approach combines the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and the discrete ordinate methods. It works with natural and urban landscapes (forests with different types of trees, buildings, rivers,…), with topography and atmosphere above and within the landscape. It simulates light propagation from solar irradiance (Top of Atmosphere) and/or thermal emission within the scene.

== Context [http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart/dart_contexte.html] ==
The study of the functioning of Continental surfaces requires the understanding of the various energetic and physiologic mechanisms that influence these surfaces. For example, the radiation absorbed in the visible spectral domain is the major energy source for vegetation photosynthesis. Moreover, energy and mass fluxes at the "Earth - Atmosphere" interface affect surface functioning, and consequently climatology.

In this context, Earth observation from space (i.e., space remote sensing) is an indispensable tool, due to its unique potential to provide synoptic and continuous surveys of the Earth, at different time and space scales.

The difficulty in studying continental surfaces arises from the complexity of the energetic and physiologic processes involved and also from the different time and space scales concerned. It comes also from the complexity of satellite remote sensing space and from its links to quantities that characterize Earth functioning. These remarks underline the need of models, because only these can couple and gather within a single scheme all concerned processes.

'''Energy modeling''' or '''energy system modeling''' is the process of building computer models of [[energy system]]s in order to analyze them.  Such models often employ [[scenario analysis]] to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play.  Outputs may include the system feasibility, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, cumulative [[Cost|financial costs]], [[natural resource]] use, and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the system under investigation.  A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering.  [[Mathematical optimization]] is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense.  Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand-alone in scope.  Governments maintain national energy models for [[energy policy]] development.

Energy models are usually intended to contribute variously to system operations, [[Engineering design process|engineering design]], or [[energy policy]] development.  This page concentrates on policy models.  Individual [[building energy simulation]]s are explicitly excluded, although they too are sometimes called energy models.  [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]-style [[integrated model]]s, which also contain a representation of the world energy system and are used to examine global transformation pathways through to 2050 or 2100 are not considered here in detail.

Energy modeling has increased in importance as the need for [[climate change mitigation]] has grown in importance.  The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"&gt;

== Model types ==

A wide variety of model types are in use.  This section attempts to categorize the key types and their usage.  The divisions provided are not hard and fast and mixed-paradigm models exist.  In addition, the results from more general models can be used to inform the specification of more detailed models, and vice versa, thereby creating a [[hierarchy]] of models.  Models may, in general, need to capture "complex dynamics such as:
* energy system operation
* technology stock turnover
* technology innovation
* firm and household behaviour
* energy and non-energy capital investment and labour market adjustment dynamics leading to economic restructuring
* infrastructure deployment and urban planning"&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;

Models may be limited in scope to the electricity sector or they may attempt to cover an energy system in its entirety (see below).

Most energy models are used for [[scenario analysis]].  A scenario is a coherent set of assumptions about a possible system.  New scenarios are tested against a baseline scenario – normally [[Business as usual (business)|business-as-usual]] (BAU) – and the differences in outcome noted.

The [[time horizon]] of the model is an important consideration.  Single-year models – set in either the present or the future (say 2050) – assume a non-evolving [[Capital (economics)|capital]] structure and focus instead on the operational dynamics of the system.  Single-year models normally embed considerable temporal (typically hourly resolution) and technical detail (such as individual generation plant and transmissions lines).  Long-range models – cast over one or more decades (from the present until say 2050) – attempt to encapsulate the structural evolution of the system and are used to investigate capacity expansion and energy system transition issues.

Models often use [[mathematical optimization]] to solve for redundancy in the specification of the system.  Some of the techniques used derive from [[operations research]].   Most rely on [[linear programming]] (including [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|mixed-integer programming]]), although some use [[nonlinear programming]].  Solvers may use classical or [[Genetic programming|genetic optimisation]], such as [[CMA-ES]].  Models may be recursive-dynamic, solving sequentially for each time interval, and thus evolving through time.  Or they may be framed as a single forward-looking intertemporal problem, and thereby assume perfect foresight.  Single-year engineering-based models usually attempt to minimize the [[Long run and short run|short-run]] financial cost, while single-year market-based models use optimization to determine [[market clearing]].  Long-range models, usually spanning decades, attempt to minimize both the short and long-run costs as a single intertemporal problem.

The demand-side (or end-user domain) has historically received relatively scant attention, often modeled by just a simple [[demand curve]].  End-user energy demand curves, in the short-run at least, are normally found to be highly [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].

As [[intermittent energy source]]s and [[energy demand management]] grow in importance, models have needed to adopt an hourly temporal resolution in order to better capture their real-time dynamics.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016b"&gt;

=== Electricity sector models ===

Electricity sector models are used to model electricity systems.  The scope may be national or regional, depending on circumstances.  For instance, given the presence of national interconnectors, the western European electricity system may be modeled in its entirety.

Engineering-based models usually contain a good characterization of the technologies involved, including the high-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] [[transmission grid]] where appropriate.  Some models (for instance, models for Germany) may assume a single common bus or "copper plate" where the grid is strong.  The demand-side in electricity sector models is typically represented by a fixed [[load profile]].

Market-based models, in addition, represent the prevailing [[electricity market]], which may include [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|nodal pricing]].

[[Game theory]] and [[agent-based model]]s are used to capture and study [[Perfect competition|strategic behavior]] within [[electricity market]]s.&lt;ref name="david-and-wen-2000"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy system models are often national in scope, but may be municipal or international.

So-called ''top-down models'' are broadly economic in nature and based on either [[partial equilibrium]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  General equilibrium models represent a specialized activity and require dedicated [[algorithms]].  Partial equilibrium models are more common.

So-called ''bottom-up models'' capture the engineering well and often rely on techniques from [[operations research]].  Individual plants are characterized by their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), nameplate capacities, investment costs ([[Capital expenditure|capex]]), and operating costs ([[Operating expense|opex]]).  Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  LEAP was developed at the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]]'s (SEI) US Center.  LEAP can be used to examine city, statewide, national, and regional energy systems.  LEAP is normally used for forecast studies of between 20–50 years.  Most of its calculations occur at yearly intervals.  LEAP allows policy analysts to create and evaluate alternative [[Scenario analysis|scenarios]] and to compare their energy requirements, [[Social cost|social costs and benefits]], and environmental impacts.

=== Power System Simulation ===
[[General Electric]]'s MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various [[Regional transmission organization (North America)|Regional Transmission Organizations]] and [[Regional transmission organization (North America)#Independent System Operators (ISOs)|Independent System Operators]] in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. [[ABB]]'s PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a [[Siemens]] software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB PROMOD Market Simulation|url=https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-analysis/promod|work=new.abb.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Production Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/maps|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Reliability Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/mars|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Power System Load Flow Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSRC 2018 IRM Study Report|url=http://www.nysrc.org/pdf/Reports/2018%20IRM%20Study%20Report%20Final%2012-8-17[2098].pdf|p=2|work=www.nysrc.org|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Notice to Stakeholders of Request for MAPS data|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/documents/Legal_and_Regulatory/Notices/MP_Notices/Notice%20to%20Generators%20re%20GE%20MAPS%20database%20input%20files%20for%20CARIS%202%20-%209-9-14.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=August 2000|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens PSSE|url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html|work=www.siemens.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Resource Planning Analysis (NYSPSC)|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/committees/mc/meeting_materials/2015-12-17/Agenda%2004_NYSDPS%20SRP%20Presentation_revised.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARKAL/TIMES ===

{{main|MARKAL}}

MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) is an integrated energy systems modeling platform, used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over time-frames of up to several decades.  MARKAL can be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and natural resource depletion.  The software was developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) over a period of almost two decades.

TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) is an evolution of MARKAL – both energy models have many similarities.&lt;ref name="comparison-times-markal-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models are technology explicit, dynamic [[partial equilibrium]] models of [[energy market]]s. In both cases, the equilibrium is determined by maximizing the total [[Economic surplus|consumer and producer surplus]] via [[linear programming]].  Both MARKAL and TIMES are written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

The TIMES model generator was also developed under the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP).  TIMES combines two different, but complementary, systematic approaches to modeling energy – a technical engineering approach and an economic approach.  TIMES is a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses [[linear programming]] to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user-specified constraints, over the medium to long-term.  It is used for "the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios".&lt;ref name="loulou-etal-2005"&gt;

=== NEMS ===

{{main|National Energy Modeling System}}

[[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] (National Energy Modeling System) is a long-standing United States government policy model, run by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE).  NEMS computes equilibrium fuel prices and quantities for the US energy sector.  To do so, the software iteratively solves a sequence of linear programs and nonlinear equations.&lt;ref name="gabriel-etal-1999"&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Public policy energy models have been criticized for being insufficiently [[Open research|transparent]].  The [[source code]] and data sets should at least be available for [[peer review]], if not explicitly published.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016a"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70298">{{For|the condition characterized by [[comorbidity]] of a specific set of impairments to executive functioning|Dysexecutive syndrome}}

In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], '''executive dysfunction''', or '''executive function deficit''', is a disruption to the efficacy of the [[executive functions]], which is a group of [[cognitive processes]] that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction can refer to both [[neurocognitive]] deficits and behavioural [[symptom]]s. It is implicated in numerous [[Psychopathology#As a descriptive term|psychopathologies]] and [[mental disorder]]s, as well as short-term and long-term changes in non-clinical executive control.

Executive dysfunction is not the same as [[dysexecutive syndrome]], a term coined by [[Alan Baddeley]] to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions, such as deficiencies in [[planning]], abstract thinking, [[Cognitive flexibility|flexibility]] and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;Wilson, B.A., Evans, J.J., Emslie, H., Alderman, N., &amp; Burgess, P. (1998). The development of an ecologically valid test for assessing patients with a dysexecutive syndrome. ''Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 8'', 213-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Baddeley, A."&gt;Baddeley, A., &amp; Wilson, B. (1988). Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome. ''Brain and Cognition, 7'', 212-230.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of symptoms, usually resulting from brain damage, tend to occur together.&lt;ref&gt;Halligan, P.W., Kischka, U., &amp; Marshall, J.C. (2004). ''Handbook of clinical neuropsychology.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of dysexecutive syndrome is [[Dysexecutive syndrome#Controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Stuss et. al"&gt;Stuss, D.T. &amp; Alexander, M.P. (2007). Is there a dysexecutive syndrome? ''Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 362'' (1481), 901-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Executive functioning]] is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Executive processes are integral to higher [[brain function]], particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, [[self-monitoring]], [[attention]], response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.&lt;ref name="Jurado Rosselli"&gt;Jurado MB, Rosselli M (2007). The elusive nature of executive functions: a review of our current understanding. Neuropsychol Rev, 17(3):213–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.

Executive dysfunction does occur to a minor degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control.&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2007"&gt;Schmeichel, BJ (2007). Attention Control, memory updating, and emotion regulation temporarily reduce the capacity for executive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136(2):241–55&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging.&lt;ref name="Zelazo et al"&gt;Zelazo PD, Craik FI, Booth L (2004). Executive function across the life span. Acta Psychol (Amst), 115 (2–3):167–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Bisiacchi"&gt;Bisiacchi PS, Borella E, Bergamaschi S, Carretti B, Mondini S (2008). Interplay between memory and executive functions in normal and pathological aging. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 30(6):723–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction appears to consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive control in the inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation.&lt;ref name="Nieuwen"&gt;Nieuwenhuis S, Broerse A, Nielen MM, de Jong R (2004). A goal activation approach to the study of executive function: an application to antisaccade tasks. Brain Cogn. 56(2):198–214. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"/&gt; Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;Avila C, Barros A, Ortet G, Parcet MA &amp; Ibanez M I (2003). Set-shifting and sensitivity to reward: A possible dopamine mechanism for explaining disinhibitory disorders. Cognition and Emotion, 17, 951–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and [[aggressive behaviour]] in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in [[working memory]] capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[hyperemotionality]].&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2008"&gt;Schmeichel BJ, Volokhov RN &amp; Demaree HA (2008). Working memory capacity and the Self-Regulation of Emotional Expression and Experience" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 95(6), 1526–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Barkley]] proposed a hybrid model of the role of behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;

Other common and distinctive symptoms of executive dysfunction include utilization behaviour, which is compulsive manipulation/use of nearby objects due simply to their presence and accessibility (rather than a functional reason); and [[imitation]] behaviour, a tendency to rely on imitation as a primary means of [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann MW, &amp; Bill PLA (1992). The environmental dependency syndrome, imitation behaviour and utilization behaviour as presenting symptoms of bilateral frontal lobe infarction due to moyamoya disease. South African Medical Journal, 81(5): 271–73&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that executive set shifting is a co-mediator with [[episodic memory]] of [[Children's use of information#Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)|feeling-of-knowing]] (FOK) accuracy, such that executive dysfunction may reduce FOK accuracy.&lt;ref name="Perrotin"&gt;Perrotin A, Tournell L, Isingrini M (2008). Executive functioning and memory as potential mediators of the episodic feeling-of-knowing accuracy" ''Brain and Cognition'' 67:76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=A |last2=Windmann |first2=S |last3=McKenna |first3=P |last4=Güntürkün |first4=O |date=May 2007 |title=Creative thinking in schizophrenia: the role of executive dysfunction and symptom severity |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17453904 |doi=10.1080/13546800601046714}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm [[etiology]] for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of [[psychosis]] are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/[[schizotypy]] due to [[dopamine]] overlap.&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;Keshavan MS, Sujata M, Mehra A, Montrose DM, Sweeney JA (2003). Psychosis proneness and ADHD in young relatives of schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia Research, 59(1), 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of executive dysfunction is heterogeneous,&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"&gt;Nigg JT (2006). What causes ADHD?: Understanding what goes wrong and why. New York, NY: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-267-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[neurocognitive]] processes are involved in the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory play a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.

Executive processes are closely integrated with memory retrieval capabilities for overall cognitive control; in particular, goal/task-information is stored in both short-term and long-term memory, and effective performance requires effective storage and retrieval of this information.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"&gt;Verbruggen F, Logan GD. (2008). Long-term aftereffects of response inhibition: memory retrieval, task goals, and cognitive control. J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 34(5):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction characterizes many of the symptoms observed in numerous [[#Executive dysfunction in clinical populations|clinical populations]]. In the case of [[acquired brain injury]] and neurodegenerative diseases there is a clear neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, [[syndromes]] and [[Mental disorder|disorders]] are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson's disease, a [[neurodegenerative]] condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as [[ADHD|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
As previously mentioned, executive functioning is not a unitary concept.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] brain regions.&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark C, Gallo J, Glosser G, Grossman M (2002). Memory encoding and retrieval in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychology. 16(2); 190–96&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported to some extent by the primary literature, which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berquin 1998"&gt;Berquin PC, Giedd JN, Jacobsen LK, Hamburger SD, Krain AL, Rapoport JL, Castellanos FX (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study" ''Neurology'' 50, 1087–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases of executive dysfunction, deficits are attributed to either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter P, Just M &amp; Reichle E (2000). Working memory and executive function: evidence from neuroimaging. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. 10; 195–99&lt;/ref&gt; Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be the primary site of cortical activation during these tasks.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"&gt;Dougherty D, Ottowitz W, Savage C (2002). Neural network basis for abnormalities of attention and executive function in major depressive disorder: implications for application of the medical disease model to psychiatric disorders. Harvard Review of Psychology. 10(2); 86–99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson's disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the [[globus pallidus]]&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; and appear to be the genuine result of [[basal ganglia]] damage.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt;

With substantial cognitive load, fMRI signals indicate a common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Caparelli E, Chang L, Ernst T et al. (2006). Different activation patterns for working memory load and visual attention load. Brain Research. 158–65&lt;/ref&gt; This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both a direct and an indirect circuit.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the [[striatum]] and [[thalamus]] to return to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt;

Not surprisingly, plaques and tangles in the frontal cortex can cause disruption in functions as well as damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Clark"/&gt; Another important point is in the finding that structural [[MRI]] images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner, R. (2004). Memory and executive function in aging and AD: multiple factors that cause decline and reserve factors that compensate" ''Neuron'' 44;195–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging view suggests that cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt; A challenge for future research will be to map the multiple brain regions that might combine with each other in a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Certain genes have been identified with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;Friedman, et al (2008). Individual differences in executive functions are almost entirely genetic in origin. Journal of experimental psychology, 137(2), 201–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene ([[DRD4]]) with 7'-repeating [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD.&lt;ref name="Langley 2004"&gt;Langley K, Marshall L, Bree M van den, Thomas H, Owen M, O'Donovan M, Thapar A (2004). Association of the dopamine D4 receptor gene 7-repeat allele with neuropsychological test performance of children with ADHD" ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 161(1),133–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene ([[COMT]]) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting&lt;ref name="Tunbridge"&gt;Tunbridge EM, Bannerman DM, Sharp T, Harrison PJ (2004). Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition improves set-shifting performance and elevates stimulated dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex" ''Journal of Neuroscience'' 24(23):5331–35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Sengupta 2008"&gt;Sengupta S, Grizenko N, Schmitz N, Schwartz G, Bellingham J, Polotskaia A, Stepanian MT, Goto Y, Grace AA, Joober R (2008). COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism and the modulation of task-oriented behavior in children with ADHD" ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 2008, 13:3069–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"&gt;Alfimova MV, Golimbet VE, Gritsenko IK, Lezheiko TV, Abramova LI, Strel'tsova MA, Khlopina IV, Ebstein R (2007). Interaction of dopamine system genes and cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and in healthy subjects from the general population. Neuroscience Behaviour Physiology, 37(7), 643–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and measurement ==
There are several measures that can be employed to assess the executive functioning capabilities of an individual. Although a trained non-professional working outside of an institutionalized setting can legally and competently perform many of these measures, a trained professional administering the test in a standardized setting will yield the most accurate results.&lt;ref name ="Daghar"&gt;Daghar A, Monchi O, Petre V et al (2001). "Wisconsin card revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging." ''The Journal of Neuroscience'' 21(19)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock drawing test ===
The Clock drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive task that can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits.&lt;ref name ="Shulman"&gt;Shulman, K (2000). Clock drawing: Is it the ideal cognitive screening test? International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 15(6); 548–61&lt;/ref&gt; Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.&lt;ref&gt;Emond J, Galasko D, Hanson L. et al (2008). Spatial deficits predict rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-verified dementia with lewy bodies. Neuropsychology. 22(6); 729–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of the CDT begins with the instruction to the participant to draw a clock reading a specific time (generally 11:10). After the task is complete, the test administrator draws a clock with the hands set at the same specific time. Then the patient is asked to copy the image.&lt;ref name ="Jeste"&gt;Jeste DV, Legendre SA, Rice VA, et al (2004). "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients." Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology. 17(190)&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in clock drawing are classified according to the following categories: omissions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, distortions, substitutions and additions.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; Memory, concentration, initiation, energy, mental clarity and indecision are all measures that are scored during this activity.&lt;ref name ="Damasio"&gt;Damasio H, Rudrauf D, Tranel D, Vianna E (2008). Does the clock drawing test have focal neuroanatomical correlates? Neuropsychology. 22(5); 553–62&lt;/ref&gt; Those with deficits in executive functioning will often make errors on the first clock but not the second.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; In other words, they will be unable to generate their own example, but will show proficiency in the copying task.

=== Stroop task ===
The cognitive mechanism involved in the [[Stroop task]] is referred to as directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"&gt;Biederam J, Faraone S, Monutaeux M, et al (2000). Neuropsychological functioning in nonreferred siblings of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder" ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 109(2); 252–65&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word "red" is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say "blue" when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod C (1991). Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: An integrative review" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 109(20); 163–203&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;de Young R (2009)." Stroop task: A test of capacity to direct attention." EPLab: Measures. University of Michigan; http://www.snre.umich.edu/eplab/demos/st0/stroopdesc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin card sorting test ===
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]] (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; These abilities are primarily determined by the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are crucial components of executive functioning;&lt;ref&gt;Andermahr I, Gaser C, Hager F et al (1996). Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting test—a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. 75(3); 145–57&lt;/ref&gt; making the WCST a good measure for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The WCST utilizes a deck of 128 cards that contains four stimulus cards.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages 9 and 11 are able to show the cognitive flexibility that is needed for this test.&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkham|first=N.

=== Trail-making test ===
Another prominent test of executive dysfunction is known as the [[Trail-making test]]. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A &amp; Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"&gt;Arbuthnott K, Frank J (2000). Trail making test, Part B as a measure of executive control: validation using a set-switching paradigm. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 22(4); 518–28&lt;/ref&gt; Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant's objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudino E, Geisler M, Squires N (1995). Construct validity in the trail making test: What makes part B harder? Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 17(4); 529–35&lt;/ref&gt; The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing.&lt;ref name ="Conn"&gt;Conn H (1977). Trail-making and number-connection tests in the assessment of mental state in portal systemic encephalopathy. Digestive Diseases. 22(6); 541–50&lt;/ref&gt; Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"/&gt; Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.&lt;ref name ="Conn"/&gt;

== In clinical populations ==
The executive system's broad range of functions relies on, and is instrumental in, a broad range of neurocognitive processes. Clinical presentation of severe executive dysfunction that is unrelated to a specific disease or disorder is classified as a [[Dysexecutive Syndrome|dysexecutive syndrome]], and often appears following damage to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Chan 2001"&gt;Chan, RC. (2001). Dysexecutive symptoms among a non-clinical sample: a study with the use of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. British Journal of Psychology, Aug., 92 (pt 3):551–65.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Executive dysfunction is implicated [[etiology|etiologically]] and/or [[co-morbidity|co-morbidly]] in many psychiatric illnesses, which often show the same symptoms as the dysexecutive syndrome. It has been assessed and researched extensively in relation to cognitive developmental disorders, [[psychotic disorders]], [[affective disorders]], and [[conduct disorder]]s, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI).

Environmental dependency syndrome is a dysexecutive syndrome marked by significant behavioural dependence on environmental cues and is marked by excessive imitation and utilization behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"&gt;Lhermitte F (1986). Human autonomy and the frontal lobes. Part II: Patient behavior in complex and social situations: the "environmental dependency syndrome" ''Annals of Neurology'' 19(4):335–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in patients with a variety of etiologies including ABI, exposure to phendimetrazine tartrate,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann 2007"&gt;Hoffmann M (2007). Transient environmental dependency syndrome due to phendimetrazine tartrate. Eur Neurol, 58(1):49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; stroke, and various frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[Schizophrenia]] is commonly described as a mental disorder in which a person becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"/&gt; Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[amnesia]] for portions of their [[episodic memory]]. Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, [[implicit memory]] is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate spared performance on measures of visual and verbal attention and concentration, as well as on immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name ="Oram"&gt;Oram J, Geffen GM, Geffen LB, Kavanaugh DJ &amp; McGrath JJ (2005). Executive control of working memory in schizophrenia" ''Psychiatry Research'' 135, 8190&lt;/ref&gt; However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function. Working memory and multi-tasking impairments typically characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"/&gt; Persons with schizophrenia also tend to demonstrate deficits in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Thoma &amp; Duam"&gt;Thoma P &amp; Duam I (2008). Working memory and multi-tasking in [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with and without comorbid substance use disorder" ''Addiction'' 103, 774–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients often demonstrate noticeable deficits in the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch]]. However, performance on tasks associated with the [[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]] are typically less affected.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Radvasnky"&gt;Radvansky GA (2006). Human Memory. United States of America: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the visuospatial system is required for central executive control.&lt;ref name ="Oram"/&gt; The phonological system appears to be more generally spared overall.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characterize attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with [[ADHD]] often experience problems with organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"&gt;Marchetta N, Hurks P, Krabbendam L &amp; Jolles J (2008). Interference control, working memory, concept shifting, and verbal fluency in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Neruopsychology, 22(1), 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; In both children and adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and verbal fluency.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"&gt;Barkley RA (1997). Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 121(1), 65–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"&gt;Rosenman S (2006). Reconsidering the attention deficit paradigm. Australasian Psychiatry, 14(2), 127–32&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; However, some research has suggested the possibility that the severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.

Although ADHD has typically been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it has also been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits.&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output).&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
[[Autism]] is diagnosed based on the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. It is a disorder that is defined according to behaviour as no specific biological markers are known.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt; Due to the variability in severity and impairment in functioning exhibited by persons with autism, the disorder is typically conceptualized as existing along a continuum (or spectrum) of severity.

Individuals with autism commonly show impairment in three main areas of executive functioning:&lt;ref name ="Barnard"&gt;Barnard L, Muldoon K, Hasan R, O'Brien G &amp; Stewart M (2008). Profiling executive dysfunction in adults with autism and comorbid learning disability. Autism, 12(2), 125–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gilotty"&gt;Gilotty L, Kenworthy L, Sirian L, Black D &amp; Wagner A (2002). Adaptive skills and executive function in autism spectrum disorders. Child Neuropsychology, 8(4), 241–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"&gt;Firestone P &amp; Dozois JA (2007). Abnormal Psychology: Perspectives (3rd edition.). Toronto: Pearson Education Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"&gt;Hill EL (2004). Executive dysfunction in autism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(1), 26–32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluency.''' Fluency refers to the ability to generate novel ideas and responses. Although adult populations are largely underrepresented in this area of research, findings have suggested that children with autism generate fewer novel words and ideas and produce less complex responses than matched controls.
* '''Planning.''' Planning refers to a complex, dynamic process, wherein a sequence of planned actions must be developed, monitored, re-evaluated and updated. Persons with autism demonstrate impairment on tasks requiring planning abilities relative to typically functioning controls, with this impairment maintained over time. As might be suspected, in the case of autism comorbid with learning disability, an additive deficit is observed in many cases.
* '''Flexibility.''' Poor mental flexibility, as demonstrated in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested that individuals with autism experience a sort of 'stuck-in-set' perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.

Although there has been some debate, inhibition is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism.&lt;ref name ="Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; However, performance on the [[Stroop task]], for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.

In general, individuals with autism show relatively spared performance on tasks that do not require [[mentalization]].&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: use of desire and emotion words, sequencing behavioural pictures, and the recognition of basic facial emotional expressions. In contrast, individuals with autism typically demonstrated impaired performance on tasks that do require mentalizing.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: false beliefs, use of belief and idea words, sequencing [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] pictures, and recognizing complex emotions such as admiring or scheming.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
[[Bipolar disorder]] is a mood disorder that is characterized by both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months).&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt; Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"&gt;Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, Goswami U, Young AH, Ferrier IN &amp; Moore PB (2006). A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder" ''Journal of Affective Disorders'' 93, 105–15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally,&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt; indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt;

Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Glahn"&gt;Glahn DC, Bearden CE, Barguil M, Barrett J, Reichenberg A, Bowden CL, Soars JC &amp; Velligan DI (2007). The neurocognitive signature of psychotic bipolar disorder. Journal of Biology Psychiatry, 62, 910–16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It has been suggested that a "stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [of the brain] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder".&lt;ref name ="Dixon"&gt;Dixon T, Kravariti E, Frith C, Murray RM &amp; McGuire PK (2004). Effect of symptoms on executive function in bipolar illness" ''Psychological Medicine'' 34, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the [[formal thought disorder]] that is a feature of mania.&lt;ref name ="Dixon"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of [[psychosis]] demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis&lt;ref name ="Glahn"/&gt; suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) primarily involves damage to subcortical brain structures and is usually associated with movement difficulties, in addition to problems with memory and thought processes.&lt;ref name ="Ward"&gt;Ward J (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Persons affected by PD often demonstrate difficulties in [[working memory]], a component of executive functioning. Cognitive deficits found in early PD process appear to involve primarily the fronto-executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"&gt;Schneider JS (2007). Behavioral persistence deficit in Parkinson's disease patients. Journal of Neurology, 14, 300–04&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies of the role of dopamine in the cognition of PD patients have suggested that PD patients with inadequate dopamine supplementation are more impaired in their performance on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Grossman"&gt;Grossman M, Lee C, Morris J, Stern MB &amp; Hurtig H (2002). Assessing resource demands during sentence processing in Parkinson's disease. Brain and Language, 80, 603–16&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that dopamine may contribute to executive control processes. Increased distractibility, problems in set formation and maintaining and shifting attentional sets, deficits in executive functions such as self-directed planning, problems solving, and working memory have been reported in PD patients.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt; In terms of working memory specifically, persons with PD show deficits in the areas of: a) spatial working memory; b) [[central executive]] aspects of working memory; c) loss of [[episodic memories]]; d) locating events in time.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grossman"/&gt;

'''Spatial working memory.'''
PD patients often demonstrate difficulty in updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not keep track of spatial contextual information in the same way that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations of objects that they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.

'''Central executive aspects.'''
PD is often characterized by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one's stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may be more appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of a higher level of difficulty.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt;

'''Loss of episodic memories.'''
The loss of episodic memories in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories are generally more preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson's than in [[Alzheimer's]], the opposite is true for event data memories.

'''Locating events in time.'''
PD patients often demonstrate deficits in their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.

=== Treatment ===

==== Psychosocial treatment ====
Since 1997 there has been experimental and clinical practice of psychosocial treatment for adults with executive dysfunction, and particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychosocial treatment addresses the many facets of executive difficulties, and as the name suggests, covers academic, occupational and social deficits. Psychosocial treatment facilitates marked improvements in major symptoms of executive dysfunction such as time management, organization and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ramsay Rostain 2007"&gt;Ramsay JR &amp; Rostain AL (2007). Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults: Current status and future directions. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(6), 624–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive-behavioral therapy and group rehabilitation ====
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) is a frequently suggested treatment for executive dysfunction, but has shown limited effectiveness. However, a study of CBT in a group rehabilitation setting showed a significant increase in positive treatment outcome compared with individual therapy. Patients' self-reported symptoms on 16 different ADHD/executive-related items were reduced following the treatment period.&lt;ref name="Virta 2008"&gt;Virta M, Vedenpää A, Grönroos N, Chydenius E, Partinen M, Vataja R, Kaski M, Iivanainen M (2008). Adults with ADHD benefit from cognitive-behaviorally oriented group rehabilitation: a study of 29 participants. Journal of Attention Disorders, 12(3), 218–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment for patients with acquired brain injury ====
The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of dysexecutive syndrome. The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity, which appears to aid in preventing "goal neglect" by increasing the patients' ability to monitor time and focus on goals. Given such stimuli, subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ.&lt;ref name="Manly 2001"&gt;Manly T, Hawkins K, Evans J, Woldt K, Robertson IH (2002). Rehabilitation of executive function: facilitation of effective goal management on complex tasks using periodic auditory alerts" ''Neuropsychologia'' 40(3):271–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with acquired brain injury have also been exposed to goal management training (GMT). GMT skills are associated with paper-and-pencil tasks that are suitable for patients having difficulty setting goals. From these studies there has been support for the effectiveness of GMT and the treatment of executive dysfunction due to ABI.&lt;ref name="Levine 2000"&gt;Levine B, Robertson IH, Clare L, Carter G &amp; Hong J (2000). Rehabilitation of executive functioning: An experimental–clinical validation of Goal Management Training. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 6: 299–312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental context ===
An understanding of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their role in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"&gt;De Boechorstraat V, Geurts H, Oosterlaan J et al (2001). How specific is a deficit of executive functioning for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"/&gt;

Some research has suggested a link between a child's abilities to gain information about the world around them and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"&gt;Barchfeld P, Kain W, Perner J (2002). Executive control and higher-order theory of mind in children at risk at ADHD. Austria: Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt; One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt; The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of [[theory of mind]] in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt;

Both ADHD and obesity are complicated disorders and each produces a large impact on an individual's social well being.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"&gt;Dempsey A, Dyehouse J (2008). The relationship between executive function, AD/HD, and obesity. Western Journal of Nursing Research. 30(8); 1026–27&lt;/ref&gt; This being both a physical and psychological disorder has reinforced that obese individuals with ADHD need more treatment time (with associated costs), and are at a higher risk of developing physical and emotional complications.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; The cognitive ability to develop a comprehensive self-construct and the ability to demonstrate capable emotion regulation is a core deficit observed in people with ADHD and is linked to deficits in executive function.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.

It has been made known that young children with behavioral problems show poor verbal ability and executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor R, Hughes C (2006). Behavioral problems in 2-year-olds: links with individual differences in theory of mind, executive function and harsh parenting" ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry'' 47(5); 488–97&lt;/ref&gt; The exact distinction between parenting style and the importance of family structure on child development is still somewhat unclear. However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity.&lt;ref name ="Dennis"&gt;Dennis T (2006). Self-regulation in preschools: the interplay of child approach reactivity, parenting and control capacities" ''Developmental Psychology'' 42(1); 84–97&lt;/ref&gt; In Mahoney's study of maternal communication, results indicated that the way mothers interacted with their children accounted for almost 25% of variability in children's rate of development.&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"&gt;Mahoney GJ (1988). Maternal communication style with mentally retarded children. American Journal of Mental Retardation, 93; 352–59&lt;/ref&gt; Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child's level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance).&lt;ref name ="Dennis"/&gt; A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.&lt;ref name ="Herman"&gt;Herman B, Mahoney G, Perales F et al (2006). Responsive teaching: early intervention for children with down syndrome and other disabilities. Down Syndrome Research and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the principle of "active learning",&lt;ref name ="Herman"/&gt; responsive teaching is a method that is currently being applauded as adaptable for individual caregivers, children and their combined needs&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"/&gt; The effect of parenting styles on the development of children is an important area of research that seems to be forever ongoing and altering. There is no doubt that there is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The prefrontal lobe controls two related executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem solving, and understanding information, as well as engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"&gt;Ardila A (2008). On the evolutionary origins of executive functions. Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt; The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt;

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"&gt;Barkley RA (2001). The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective. Neuropsychology Review, 11(1), 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which gave rise to the need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

In a similar vein, some have argued that the unique metacognitive capabilities demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, over the course of the development of self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

== Socio-cultural implications ==

=== Education ===
In the classroom environment, children with executive dysfunction typically demonstrate skill deficits that can be categorized into two broad domains: a) self-regulatory skills; and b) goal-oriented skills.&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall A (2001). Executive functions: Practical strategies for supporting students. Psychological Services, DDSB. Symposium conducted at DDSB, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below is an adaptation of McDougall's&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; summary and provides an overview of specific executive function deficits that are commonly observed in a classroom environment.

Teachers play a crucial role in the implementation of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"&gt;Lerner JW &amp; Kline F (2006). Learning disabilities and related disorders: Characteristics and teaching strategies (10th ed.). United States of America: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.

Several factors should be considered in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"/&gt; It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout the course of the day can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.

People with executive dysfunction have a slower cognitive processing speed and thus often take longer to complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt;

Moreover, some people with ADHD report experiencing frequent feelings of drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown TE (2008). Describing Six Aspects of a Complex Syndrome. http://www.drthomasebrown.com/pdfs/Executive_Functions_by_Thomas_Brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can hinder their attention for lectures, readings, and completing assignments. Individuals with this disorder have also been found to require more stimuli for information processing in reading and writing.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Slow processing may manifest in behavior as signaling a lack of motivation on behalf of the learner. However, slow processing is reflective of an impairment of the ability to coordinate and integrate multiple skills and information sources.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main concern with individuals with autism regarding learning is in the imitation of skills.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism tend to be dependent on the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Being attentive and focused for people with Tourette's syndrome is a difficult process. People affected by this disorder tend to be easily distracted and act very impulsively.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt; That is why it is very important to have a quiet setting with few distractions for the ultimate learning environment. Focusing is particularly difficult for those who are affected by Tourette's syndrome comorbid with other disorders such as ADHD or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], it makes focusing very difficult.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Gaffney GR (2005). Tourette Syndrome. University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329091227/http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these individuals can be found to repeat words or phrases consistently either immediately after they are learned or after a delayed period of time.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt;

=== Criminal behaviour ===

Prefrontal dysfunction has been found as a marker for persistent, criminal behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"&gt;Barbosa M, Monteiro L (2008). Recurrent criminal behaviour and executive dysfunction. The Spanish Journal of Psychology, 259–65&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex is involved with mental functions including; affective range of emotions, forethought, and self-control.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Moreover, there is a scarcity of mental control displayed by individuals with a dysfunction in this area over their behavior, reduced flexibility and self-control and their difficulty to conceive behavioral consequences, which may conclude in unstable (or criminal) behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogilvie|first=James M.|last2=Stewart|first2=Anna L.|last3=Chan|first3=Raymond C. K.|last4=Shum|first4=David H. K.|date=2011-11-01|title=Neuropsychological Measures of Executive Function and Antisocial Behavior: A Meta-Analysis*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00252.x/abstract|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1063–1107|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00252.x|issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study conducted by Barbosa &amp; Monteiro, it was discovered that the recurrent criminals that were considered in this study suffered from executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; In view of the fact that abnormalities in executive function can limit how people respond to rehabilitation and re-socialization programs&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; these findings of the recurrent criminals are justified. Statistically significant relations have been discerned between anti-social behavior and executive function deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"/&gt; These findings relate to the emotional instability that is connected with executive function as a detrimental symptom that can also be linked towards criminal behavior. Conversely, it is unclear as to the specificity of anti-social behavior to executive function deficits as opposed to other generalized neuropsychological deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"&gt;Lilenfeld S, Morgan A (2000). A meta-analytic review of the relation between antisocial behavior and neuropsychological measures of executive function. Clinical Psychology Review. 20(1); 113–36&lt;/ref&gt; The uncontrollable deficiency of executive function has an increased expectancy for aggressive behavior that can result in a criminal deed.&lt;ref name ="Brower"&gt;Brower MC, Price BH (2001). Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review. Advances in Neuropsychiatry. 720–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijers|first=J.|last2=Harte|first2=J. M.|last3=Meynen|first3=G.|last4=Cuijpers|first4=P.|date=2017-02-01|title=Differences in executive functioning between violent and non-violent offenders|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/div-classtitledifferences-in-executive-functioning-between-violent-and-non-violent-offendersdiv/51D2EDD628447218922BA833A6F59D85|journal=Psychological Medicine|pages=1–10|doi=10.1017/S0033291717000241|issn=0033-2917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbitofrontal injury also hinders the ability to be risk avoidant, make social judgments, and may cause reflexive aggression.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; A common retort to these findings is that the higher incidence of cerebral lesions among the criminal population may be due to the peril associated with a life of crime.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Along with this reasoning, it would be assumed that some other personality trait is responsible for the disregard of social acceptability and reduction in social aptitude.

Furthermore, some think the dysfunction cannot be entirely to blame.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; There are interacting environmental factors that also have an influence on the likelihood of criminal action. This theory proposes that individuals with this deficit are less able to control impulses or foresee the consequences of actions that seem attractive at the time (see above) and are also typically provoked by environmental factors. One must recognize that the frustrations of life, combined with a limited ability to control life events, can easily cause aggression and/or other criminal activities. Early brain Damage causes dopamine(epigentically) to select for "Seeking" behavior in the very short term...this is the window for existence for these individuals...the future has no meaning so consequences have no meaning

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8107">The '''foot–pound–second system''' or '''FPS system''' is a system of units built on three fundamental units: the [[foot (unit)|foot]] for [[length]], the [[pound (mass)|(avoirdupois) pound]] for either [[mass]] or [[force]] (see below), and the [[second]] for [[time]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins |last=Cardarelli |first=François |publisher=Springer |year=2003 | isbn=978-1-85233-682-0 |chapter=The Foot–Pound–Second (FPS) System |pages=51–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
Collectively, the variants of the FPS system were the most common system in technical publications in English until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;

{{anchor|Stroud}}Errors can be avoided and translation between the systems facilitated by labelling all physical quantities consistently with their units. Especially in the context of the FPS system this is sometimes known as the '''Stroud system''' after [[William Stroud]], who popularized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Stroud system of teaching dynamics |last1=Henderson |first1=James B. |last2=Godfrey |first2=C. |journal=The Mathematical Gazette |volume=12 |number=170 |year=1924 |pages=99–105 |jstor=3604647}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{GravEngAbs|system=English}}

=== Pound as mass unit ===
{{anchor|mass}}
When the pound is used as a unit of mass, the core of the coherent system is similar and functionally equivalent to the corresponding subsets of the [[International System of Units]] (SI), using [[metre–kilogram–second system of units|metre, kilogram and second]] (MKS), and the earlier [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]] (CGS).

In this sub-system, the unit of [[force]] is a derived unit known as the [[poundal]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{pdl} = 1\,\text{lb} \cdot 1\,\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The international standard symbol for the pound as unit of mass rather than force is lb.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 260.1™-2004, IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch-Pound Units, and Certain Other Units) &lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Cleanup|section|date=October 2011}}
Everett (1861)&lt;!--ref missing--&gt; proposed the metric [[dyne]] and [[erg]] as the units of force and energy in the FPS system.

Latimer Clark's (1891) "Dictionary of Measures"&lt;!--ref missing--&gt; contains ''celo'' (acceleration), ''vel'' or ''velo'' (velocity) and ''pulse'' (momentum) as proposed names for FPS absolute units.&lt;!--definitions or explanations missing--&gt;

=== Pound-force as force unit ===
{{anchor|force}}
The '''technical''' or '''gravitational FPS system''',&lt;ref name=cr&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lEi8RU6Br6YC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;pg=PA5 J. M. Coulson, J. F. Richardson, J. R. Backhurst, J. H. Harker: Coulson &amp; Richardson's Chemical Engineering: Fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a coherent variant of the FPS system that is most common among engineers in the United States. It takes the [[pound-force]] as a fundamental unit of force instead of the pound as a fundamental unit of mass.

In this sub-system, the unit of mass is a derived unit known as the [[slug (unit)|slug]].&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{slug} = 1\,\text{lbf} \cdot 1\,\frac{\text{s}^2}{\text{ft}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the context of the gravitational FPS system, the pound-force (lbf) is sometimes referred to as the pound (lb).

=== Pound as force unit ===
{{anchor|weight}}
Another variant of the FPS system uses both the pound-mass and the pound-force, but neither the slug nor the poundal. The resulting system is not coherent, lacking electrical or molar units, and is sometimes also known as the '''British engineering system''', although rarely used nowadays in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

== Other units ==
{{Cleanup|section|date=October 2011}}

=== Molar units ===
The unit of substance in the FPS system is the pound-mole (lb-mol) = {{val|273.16|e=24}}.  Until the SI decided to adopt the gram-mole, the mole was directly derived from the mass unit as (mass unit)/(atomic mass unit).  The unit (lbf⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft)-mol also appears in a former definition of the atmosphere.

=== Electromagnetic units ===
The Electrostatic and Electromagnetic systems are derived from units of length and force, mainly.  As such, these are ready extensions of any system of containing length, mass, time. Stephen Dresner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dresner|first=Stephen|title=Units of Measurement|year=1971|publisher=Hastings House|location=New York|pages=193–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the derived electrostatic and electromagnetic units in both the foot–pound–second and foot–slug–second systems.  In practice, these are most associated with the centimetre–gram–second system.  The 1929 "International Critical Tables" gives in the symbols and systems fpse = FPS electrostatic system and fpsm = FPS electromagnetic system.  Under the conversions for charge, the following are given.  The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 1979 (Edition 60), also lists fpse and fpsm as standard abbreviations.

; Electromagnetic FPS (EMU, stat-)
: 1 fpsm unit = 117.581866 [[cgsm]] unit (Biot-second) {{clarify|date=December 2016}}
; Electrostatic FPS (ESU, ab-)
: 1 fpse unit = 3583.8953 cgse unit (Franklin)
: 1 fpse unit = 1.1954588×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; abs coulomb

=== Units of light ===
The ''[[candela|candle]]'' and the ''foot-candle'' were the first defined units of light, defined in the Metropolitan Gas Act (1860).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jerrard|first=H G|title=A Dictionary of Scientific Units|year=1985|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|isbn=0412281007|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foot-candle is the intensity of light at one foot from a ''standard candle''.  The units were internationally recognised in 1881, and adopted into the metric system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Donald|last=Fenna|year=2003|title=Dictionary of weights and measures|isbn=978-0-19-860522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversions ==
Together with the fact that the term "weight" is used for the gravitational force in some technical contexts (physics, engineering) and for mass in others (commerce, law),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf NIST Federal Standard 376B] , p. 13. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816011202/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf |date=August 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the distinction often does not matter in practice, the coexistence of variants of the FPS system causes confusion over the nature of the unit "pound". Its relation to international metric units is expressed in kilograms, not newtons, though, and in earlier times it was defined by means of a mass prototype to be compared with a [[weighing scale|two-pan balance]] which is agnostic of local gravitational differences.

In July 1959, the various national foot and avoirdupois pound standards were replaced by the international foot of precisely {{val|0.3048|u=m}} and the international pound of precisely {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}}, making conversion between the systems a matter of simple arithmetic. The conversion for the poundal is given by 1&amp;nbsp;pdl =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;lb·ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|0.138254954376|ul=N}} (precisely).&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt;

To convert between the absolute and gravitational FPS systems one needs to fix the [[standard gravity|standard acceleration]] ''g'' which relates the pound to the pound-force.{{fact|date=April 2018}}
:&lt;math&gt;1\,\text{lbf} = 1\,\text{lb}\cdot g&lt;/math&gt;
While ''g'' strictly depends on one's location on the Earth surface, since 1901 in most contexts it is fixed conventionally at precisely ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;{{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}} ≈&amp;nbsp;{{val|32.17405|u=ft/s2}}.&lt;ref name=cardarelli/&gt; Therefore, the slug is about {{val|32.17405|u=lb}} or {{val|14.593903|u=kg}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1938">In mathematics, '''Giraud subcategories''' form an important class of subcategories of [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]]. They are named after [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Grothendieck category]]. A full subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''reflective'', if the inclusion functor &lt;math&gt;i\colon\mathcal{B}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]]. If this left adjoint of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; also preserves 
[[kernel (category theory)|kernels]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Giraud subcategory''.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be Giraud in the Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i\colon\mathcal{B}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; the inclusion functor.
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is again a Grothendieck category.
* An object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective object|injective]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;i(X)&lt;/math&gt; is injective in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The left adjoint &lt;math&gt;a\colon\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is [[exact functor|exact]].
* Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[localizing subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be the associated [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotient category]]. The section functor &lt;math&gt;S\colon\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[full and faithful functors|fully faithful]] and induces an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the Giraud subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; given by the  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;-closed objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11881">In [[agriculture]], '''green manure''' is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a [[mulch]] and [[soil amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/green+manure|title=Green manure - Define Green manure at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants used for green manure are often [[cover crop]]s grown primarily for this purpose. Typically, they are ploughed under and incorporated into the [[soil]] while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure is commonly associated with [[organic farming]] and can play an important role in sustainable annual cropping systems.

==Functions==
Green manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:

* [[Leguminous]] green manures such as [[clover]] and [[vetch]] contain [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] in [[root nodules]] that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization.  If desired, [[animal]] manures may also be added.

:Depending on the species of cover crop grown, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil lies between 40 and 200 pounds per acre. With green manure use, the amount of nitrogen that is available to the succeeding crop is usually in the range of 40-60% of the total amount of nitrogen that is contained within the green manure crop.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

* Green manure acts mainly as [[Soil acidification|soil-acidifying]] matter to decrease the alkalinity/pH of [[alkali soils]] by generating [[humic acid]] and [[acetic acid]].
* Incorporation of [[cover crops]] into the soil allows the nutrients held within the green manure to be released and made available to the succeeding crops. This results immediately from an increase in abundance of soil microorganisms from the degradation of plant material that aid in the decomposition of this fresh material.  This additional decomposition also allows for the re-incorporation of nutrients that are found in the soil in a particular form such as [[nitrogen]] (N), [[potassium]] (K), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S).
* Microbial activity from incorporation of cover crops into the soil leads to the formation of [[mycelium]] and viscous materials which benefit the health of the soil by increasing its [[soil structure]] (i.e. by aggregation).&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;
:The increased percentage of organic matter ([[biomass]]) improves [[water]] infiltration and retention, aeration, and other soil characteristics. The soil is more easily turned or tilled than non-aggregated soil. Further aeration of the soil results from the ability of the root systems of many green manure crops to efficiently penetrate compact soils. The amount of [[humus]] found in the soil also increases with higher rates of decomposition, which is beneficial for the growth of the crop succeeding the green manure crop. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used to increase biomass.
*The [[root]] systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops.
* Common [[Cover crop#Weed management|cover crop functions of weed suppression]]. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used (e.g. [[buckwheat]])&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilakoglou, Ioannis, Dhima, Kico, Anastassopoulos, Elias, Lithourgidis, Anastasios, Gougoulias, Nikolaos, and Chouliaras, Nikolaos. 2011. Oregano green manure for weed suppression in sustainable cotton and corn fields. Weed Biology and Management 11:38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some green manure crops, when allowed to [[flower]], provide [[Forage (honeybee)|forage]] for pollinating [[insect]]s. Green manure crops also often provide habitat for predatory beneficial insects, which allow for a reduction in the application of insecticides where cover crops are planted.
* Some green manure crops (e.g. [[winter wheat]] and [[winter rye]]) can also be used for grazing.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt;
* [[Erosion control]] is often also taken into account when selecting which green manure cover crop to plant.
* Some [[Cover crop#Pest management|green crops reduce plant insect pests]] and [[Cover crop#Disease management|diseases]]. [[Verticillium wilt]] is especially reduced in potato plants.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Robert P., Honeycutt, Wayne, and Olanya Modesto, O. 2011.  Management of Verticillium Wilt of Potato with Disease-Suppressive Green Manures and as Affected by Previous Cropping History. Plant Dis. 95:568-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.

Limitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).

==Nutrient creation==
Green manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by [[heterotrophic]] bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating [[compost]] fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in [[calcium]] minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher [[phosphate]] content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of carbon to [[nitrogen]] in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. [[Rhizobium]] are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=James|title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II|year=1980|publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd.|isbn=0920656102|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legume]]s, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.

==Crops==
Late-summer and fall green manure crops are [[oat]]s and [[rye]].&lt;ref name="mofga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association| url=http://www.mofga.org/portals/2/Fact%20Sheets/FS%2010%20Green%20Manures%20web.pdf| format=PDF| website=mofga.org|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The value of green manure was recognized by farmers in India for thousands of years, as mentioned in treatises like Vrikshayurveda. In Ancient Greece too, farmers ploughed broad bean plants into the soil. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 1980 145"/&gt; Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the [[fallow]] cycle of [[crop rotation]], which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.

'''Hypomnema''' (Greek. ὑπόμνημα,  plural ὑπομνήματα, ''hypomnemata''), also spelled '''hupomnema''', is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word with several translations into English including a reminder, a note, a public record, a commentary, an anecdotal record, a draft, a copy, and other variations on those terms.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23108803  Liddell and Scott Greek-English Lexicon online])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s theory of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]] recognized the new status of [[writing]] as a device of artificial [[memory]], and he developed the hypomnesic principles for his students to follow in the [[Academy]]. According to Michel Foucault, "The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later [[meditation]].
They also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth|date=1997|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
[[Michel Foucault]] uses the word in the sense of "note", but his translators use the word "notebook", which is [[anachronism|anachronistic]] (see [[codex]] and [[wax tablet]]). Concerning [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: "In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of [[notebook]]s on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents."&lt;ref&gt;"The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981-1982" Foucault, Michel, Picador, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; In an [http://foucault.info/documents/foucault.hypoMnemata.en.html excerpt from an ''Interview with Michel Foucault'' in ''The Foucault Reader''], he says: "As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later [[Christian]] literature. [... T]heir objective is not to bring the arcana conscientiae to light, the confession of which—be it oral or written—has a purifying value."

'''Ignorance''' is a lack of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ignorance|title=Ignorance|last=|first=|date=|website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ignorant|title=Ignorant meaning|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ignorant is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being [[Awareness|unaware]], and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts. Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), objectual ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).&lt;ref&gt;Nottelmann, Nikolaj. "ignorance." ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', edited by Robert Audi, Cambridge University Press, 3rd edition, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for ignorance ==
People do not experience instant gratification and therefore they do not invest time and effort in learning and developing. Eradicating ignorance completely from an individual’s life is an impossible task but reducing the gap can truly benefit the individual in a long term.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan, and BRYAN CAPLAN. "Rational Ignorance." ''The Encyclopedia of Public Choice'', edited by Charles K. Rowley, and Friedrich Schneider, Springer Science+Business Media, 1st edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, making the decision to remain ignorant by committing to an ideology despite scientific proof is a dangerous mindset that can inhibit an individual from discovering the truth and therefore developing as an individual.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, Lee. "The attack on truth: we have entered an age of willful ignorance." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 12 June 2015, p. B10+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance can stifle learning, especially if the ignorant person believes it is not ignorant. A person who falsely believes it is knowledgeable, does not try to clarify its beliefs, but rather relies on the ignorant position. It may also reject valid but contrary information, neither realizing its importance nor understanding it. This concept is elucidated in Justin Kruger and [[David Dunning]]'s work, "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, otherwise known as the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]].

Another reason why people are not able to obtain knowledge is inaccessibility to education. In some parts of the world, educational infrastructure is insufficient and therefore people are not able to seek for knowledge. The phenomenon can be observed widely in underdeveloped countries where many children either cannot afford to go to school or live too far from a school. On the other hand, in developed countries most children have access to a K12 education but once they graduate high school they encounter obstacles to pursue a higher education due to high costs. This lack of education can contribute to individuals not being able to practice critical thinking and seek for knowledge for themselves.

==Consequences==
Remaining in a state of ignorance can lead to serious economic downfalls, relationship crises, legal issues, and more. It is important for human survival to be knowledgeable on different topics. For example, one must be aware of ways to prevent certain diseases, avoid certain poisonous foods, avoid war, etc..

Individuals who are financially literate can manage finances wisely and therefore create a more stable life for themselves and their families. People who understand finance and economics can vote better on local and national economic regulations that benefit the whole society.

Another important aspect is ignorance in the legal field. People must be aware of laws so they can live free and in harmony with others. Ignorance of the law is not accepted as a legal defense, so it is the responsibility of the individual to know the law. Willingly ignoring the law can lead to arrest or isolated living.

Ignorance can have a negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions.&lt;ref&gt;[null Firestein], Stuart. ''Ignorance: How It Drives Science''. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This though can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind.

Studies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schieman, Scott and Gabriele Plickert. "How Knowledge Is Power: Education and the Sense of Control." ''Social Forces'', vol. 87, no. 1, Sept. 2008, pp. 153-183.&lt;/ref&gt; The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives.

The writer, [[Thomas Pynchon]], articulated the following about the scope and structure of one's ignorance: "Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to [the advice of] writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

'''Ilan Manouach''' (born July 11, 1980) is a [[conceptual artist]], a musician and a book publisher. He is mostly known for creating Shapereader, a tactile language specifically designed for the production of literary works for and from the visually impaired.

==Conceptual comics==
Ilan Manouach holds a BFA from [[:fr:École supérieure des arts Saint-Luc|École supérieure des arts Saint-Luc]] in Brussels. Since 2003, he has published more than a dozen bookworks under the catalogue of a small publishing house based in Brussels, [[:fr:La Cinquième Couche]]. He has curated four anthologies bringing together contributions from artists, critics, lawyers and different professionals of the book industry. His work has been described as covering a range of different experimentation within the tradition of comics, from narratives, to rip-offs and appropriations and recently to the invention of a new language, Shapereader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kartalopoulos|first=Bill|date=March 2016|title=Ilan Manouach: Defamiliarizing Comics|url=http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2016/march/ilan-manouach-defamiliarizing-comics-bill-kartalopoulos|journal=World Literature Today|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, published in 2003, was ''Les lieux et les choses qui entouraient les gens désormais''. According to comics critic [[Thierry Groensteen]], « […] It is not surprising that Manouach is also a jazz musician. His storytelling is entirely built as a succession of drone sounds, melodic lines, disjunctions, syncopations and improvisations and variations around a main theme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Système de la bande dessinée|last=Groensteen|first=Thierry|publisher=PUF|year=2011|isbn=978-2-13-058487-2|volume=Bande dessinée et narration II|location=Paris|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ».

In several later projects such as The Horse-Headed Statue, designed for an international architecture symposium in Greece in 2007, ''Écologie Forcée'', a work commissioned by the [[:fr:Biennale d'Art contemporain du Havre]] in 2010 and ''Both Sides of a Wall'', produced for the [[:fr:Festival de BD à Sierre]] in 2011, he uses exhibition space as a way to engage the spectator as the reader. Along with [[:fr:Xavier Löwenthal]], he is also the director of the anthology ''Le Coup de Grâce'', a book that collects artists' contributions to book's call for the creation of undetermined, deliberately evasive, and irredeemably idiosyncratic narratives.

His books have received support on different occasions from the [[:fr:Centre National du Livre]] in France and the [[French Community of Belgium]]. He is a Fellow and an alumnus of the [[Koneen Säätiö]] in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koneensaatio.fi/hanke/sarjakuvakirja-nakovammaisille/|title=Ilan Manouach: Sarjakuvakirja näkövammaisille|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also contributed to several anthologies, such as [[:fr:Frédéric Magazine]], [[:Fr:Éprouvette (collection)]], Glomp and [[Multitudes]] and has produced a few commissions for newspapers such as [[The New York Times]] and [[:it:Internazionale (periodico)]].

He is known for the unsigned comics appropriations, and the manifestos supplementing these editions.

He has published illegal appropriations of existing comics, and reinjected the detournements in the book market.

===Katz===
Ilan Manouach is probably the author of the famous rip-off, ''Katz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipdigit.eu/2012/03/epilogue-de-laffaire-katz/|title=Katz détourne Maus : le droit d’auteur, un fardeau pour la libre expression artistique ?|last=Lambrecht|first=Maxime|date=17 March 2012|website=ipDIGit|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Katz'' is a pirated edition of [[Art Spiegelman]]'s seminal graphic novel ''[[Maus]]''. ''Katz'' is an exact copy of the French edition of ''Maus'', with the difference that all the animal characters, have been redrawn as cats. The book was printed on November 2011 and it was seen in public for the first time in January 2012 during the Angoulême International Comics Festival  that ran under Spiegelman’s presidency.

===Noirs===
''Noirs'' is a fac-simile of the original edition of [[Les Schtroumpfs Noirs|Les Schroumpfs Noirs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://next.liberation.fr/culture/2014/01/31/les-schtroumpfs-noirs-restent-bleus_976945|title="Les Schtroumpfs noirs" restent bleus|last=Girard|first=Quentin|date=31 January 2014|website=Liberation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all printed colors replaced with blue. The book has been compared to certain appropriations from Carmelo Bene's, specifically ''Romeo e Giulietta : storia di Shakespeare secondo Carmelo Bene''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.du9.org/en/chronique/les-schtroumpfs-noirs-2/|title=Les Schtroumpfs noirs by Ilan Manouach|last=Moura|first=Pedro|date=April 2014|website=du9|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

==Shapereader==
Shapereader is a tactile language specifically designed to allow the creation of narrative works of tactile literature for, and from a visually impaired readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://50watts.com/Shapereader-and-Ilan-Manouach|title=Shapereader and Ilan Manouach|last=Kartalopoulos|first=Bill|date=March 30, 2015|website=50watts|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been mainly created for the purposes of a blind community, the Shapereader repertoire can also be experienced by the acquainted regular user. The Shapereader consists of a repertoire of anaglyph shapes called tactigrams designed to provide haptic equivalents for objects, actions, affections, characters and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bandedessinee.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/01/31/venez-essayer-la-bande-dessinee-tactile/|title=Venez essayer la bande dessinée " tactile "|last=Engelbach|first=Cathia|date=31 January 2016|website=Le Monde|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shapereader has been presented during the International Comics Festival of Angoulême,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdangouleme.com/864,ilan-manouach-shapereader|title=Ilan Manouach - Shapereader|last=|first=|date=|website=Angouleme International Comics Festival|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Onassis Cultural Center in Athens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgt.gr/gre/SPG1588/|title=Shapereader: Διαβάζοντας τα σχήματα|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and workshops have been conducted in Athens, Tel Aviv and France.

'''Inscape''' and '''instress''' are complementary concepts about individuality and uniqueness derived by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] from the ideas of the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="Chevigny"&gt;Chevigny, Bell Gale. Instress and Devotion in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins ''Victorian Studies'' Vol. 9, No. 2 (Dec., 1965), pp. 141-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Hopkins] felt that everything in the universe was characterized by what he called ''inscape'', the distinctive design that constitutes individual identity. This identity is not static but dynamic. Each being in the universe 'selves,' that is, enacts its identity. And the human being, the most highly selved, the most individually distinctive being in the universe, recognizes the inscape of other beings in an act that Hopkins calls ''instress'', the apprehension of an object in an intense thrust of energy toward it that enables one to realize specific distinctiveness. Ultimately, the instress of inscape leads one to Christ, for the individual identity of any object is the stamp of divine creation on it.&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"&gt;Stephen Greenblatt et al., Ed. "Gerard Manley Hopkins." ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature.'' 8th ed. Vol. 2. New York, London: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], 2006. pg. 2159 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is related to a logocentric theology and the [[Imago Dei]]. A logocentric theology of creation is based on correlation of the Genesis account and John 1. Since all creation is by the Word (divine fiat) human identity in God's image is grounded in God's speech and no two creation words are ever spoken alike.{{efn|While it is true that "logos" also means "word" in the conventional sense of "speech", in John it refers. not to the "divine fiat" ("Let there be Light" etc.), but to Christ as the second person of the Trinity. As the first quotation from the Norton Anthology states: "Ultimately, the inscape of instress leads one to Christ".&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"/&gt;}} This idea is reflected by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who compares the Creator to a perfect prism and creation to the refraction of perfect light. Tolkien writes,

:'Dear Sir,' I said – 'Although now long estranged,
:Man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed
:Dis-grace he may be, yet is not de-throned,
:and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned:
:Man, Sub-creator, the refracted Light
:through whom is splintered from a single White
:to many hues, and endlessly combined
:in living shapes that move from mind to mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', in ''Essays Presented to Charles Williams'', CS Lewis Ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is strongly embraced by the [[Trappists|Trappist monk]] and author [[Thomas Merton]] who admired both Scotus and Hopkins. In ''New Seeds of Contemplation'' Merton equates the unique "thingness" of a thing, its inscape, to sanctity. Merton writes,

"No two created beings are exactly alike. And their individuality is no imperfection. On the contrary, the perfection of each created thing is not merely its conformity to an abstract type but in its own individual identity with itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Merton]], ''[[Seeds of Contemplation]]'' New Directions Publishing, 1972. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is that holiness itself is grounded in God's creation, his call, and not in a [[Theory of Forms|Platonic ideal]]. To the extent that any "thing" (including humans) honors God's unique idea of them they are holy. Holiness thus connects to "[[vocation]]" (from the [[Latin]] vocare for "voice") in two ways. First, God creates through the word; and second, when being responds rightly to God's speech by expressing his unique word the result is Holiness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6464">'''Jack Gladstone''' was a [[British Guiana|Guianese]] slave who led the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823|Demerara Slave rebellion of 1823]], one of the biggest slave revolts in the British colonies.

He was tried after the rebellion, and was deported.

== Biography ==
Jack and his father, [[Quamina]], an African-born enslaved carpenter, lived and worked on Success plantation in Demerara.&lt;ref name=abolproject&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/resistance_53.html |title=Case Study 3: Demerara (1823) - Quamina and John Smith |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=The Abolition Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is surnamed Gladstone, as the enslaved adopted surnames of their masters by convention. [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]], who had never set foot on his plantation, had acquired half share in the plantation in 1812 through mortgage default; he acquired the remaining half four years later.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/view/3455/4216 |format=pdf |first=Richard B. |last=Sheridan |title=The Condition of slaves on the sugar plantations of Sir John Gladstone in the colony of Demerara 1812 to 1849 |journal=New West Indian Guide |volume=76 |year=2002 |number= 3/4 |pages= 243–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1828, the estate was entrusted to Frederick Cort, who was fired for being "an idler and a deceiver" who had mismanaged one estate after another.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

Jack was a cooper on the plantation. As a slave who did not work under a driver, he enjoyed considerable freedom to roam about.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 182"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a free spirit, and passionate man who despised limitations on his freedom; he was aware of the debate about slavery in Britain, and was made extremely listless by rumours of emancipation papers arriving from London.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 182"/&gt; Jack was tall and debonair, and possessed "European features" &amp;mdash; he stood at six feet two inches, was intelligent, and had a reputation as a "wild fellow". Jack had been baptised, was occasionally a "teacher", but was not a regular churchgoer because he was too restless to follow church rules.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken Susanna, a slave on "Le Resouvenir" who was on [[John Smith (missionary)|Rev. Smith]]'s congregation, to his wife. However, in April 1812, Quamina had found out that she had become the mistress of John Hamilton, the manager at 'Le Resouvenir'.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 149"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. Smith reacted angrily, and she was expelled her from the flock by unanimous vote when she had refused to terminate the relationship.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 149"/&gt; When Susanna left, Jack married a slave on Chateau Margo plantation, but would continue to have relations with several other women on the same plantation, to the disdain of both the owner of Margo and the manager at Success.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"/&gt;

Da Costa puts Jack's age at around 30 at the time of the rebellion.&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 180"/&gt; Following the arrival of news from Britain that measures aimed at improving the treatment of slaves in the colonies had been passed, Jack had heard a rumour that their masters had received instructions to set them free but were refusing to do so. He wrote a letter (signing his father's name) to the members of the chapel informing them of the "new law".&lt;ref name=GCN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyanacaribbeannetwork.com/ourfeature.08.04.08.htm |title=PART II Blood, sweat, tears and the struggle for basic human rights |publisher=Guyana Caribbean Network |accessdate=21 November 2009 |df= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, his father Quamina supported the idea of a peaceful strike, and made the fellow slaves promise not to use violence.

At its end, and the slaves' defeat, hundreds of slaves were executed as ringleaders, including Quamina. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to [[Saint Lucia]]. His legacy was to help bring attention to the plight of sugar plantation slaves, accelerating the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

In the branch of [[experimental psychology]] focused on [[sense]], [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]], and [[perception]], which is called [[psychophysics]], a '''just-noticeable difference''' or '''JND''' is the amount something must be changed in order for a difference to be noticeable, detectable at least half the time ([[absolute threshold]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Weber's Law of Just Noticeable Difference'', University of South Dakota: http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/WebersLaw.html&lt;/ref&gt; This [[limen]] is also known as the '''difference limen''', '''differential threshold''', or '''least perceptible difference'''.&lt;ref name=judd&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chromaticity sensibility to stimulus differences|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|pages=72–108|volume=22|year=1931|issue=2| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?id=48631|doi=10.1364/JOSA.22.000072}}&lt;/ref&gt;



For many sensory modalities, over a wide range of stimulus magnitudes sufficiently far from the upper and lower limits of perception, the 'JND' is a fixed proportion of the reference sensory level, and so the ratio of the JND/reference is roughly constant (that is the JND is a constant proportion/percentage of the reference level). Measured in physical units, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta I} {I} = k,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I\!&lt;/math&gt; is the original intensity of the particular stimulation, &lt;math&gt;\Delta I\!&lt;/math&gt; is the addition to it required for the [[Change (mathematics)#Change|change]] to be perceived (the '''JND'''), and ''k'' is a constant. This rule was first discovered by [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795–1878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A theoretical rationale (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by [[Gustav Fechner]], so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the [[Weber–Fechner law]]; the constant ''k'' is called the '''Weber constant'''. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds. It is not true, however, of the wavelength of light. [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] argued that it would hold only for what he called ''prothetic'' sensory [[Continuum (theory)|continua]], where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for ''[[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetic]]'' continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called [[Stevens' power law|Stevens' Power Law]], that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus.

The JND is a statistical, rather than an exact quantity: from trial to trial, the difference that a given person notices will vary somewhat, and it is therefore necessary to conduct many trials in order to determine the threshold. The JND usually reported is the difference that a person notices on 50% of trials. If a different proportion is used, this should be included in the description&amp;mdash;for example one might report the value of the "75% JND".

Modern approaches to psychophysics, for example [[signal detection theory]], imply that the observed JND, even in this statistical sense, is not an absolute quantity, but will depend on situational and motivational as well as perceptual factors. For example, when a researcher flashes a very dim light, a participant may report seeing it on some trials but not on others.

The JND formula has an objective interpretation (implied at the start of this entry) as the disparity between levels of the presented stimulus that is detected on 50% of occasions by a particular observed response (Torgerson, 1958), rather than what is subjectively "noticed" or as a difference in magnitudes of consciously experienced 'sensations'. This 50%-discriminated disparity can be used as a universal unit of measurement of the psychological distance of the level of a feature in an object or situation and an internal standard of comparison in memory, such as the 'template' for a category or the 'norm' of recognition (Booth &amp; Freeman, 1993). The JND-scaled distances from norm can be combined among observed and inferred psychophysical functions to generate diagnostics among hypothesised information-transforming (mental) processes mediating observed quantitative judgments (Richardson &amp; Booth, 1993).

==Music production applications==
In music production, a single change in a property of sound which is below the JND does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1&amp;nbsp;dB (Middlebrooks &amp; Green, 1991; Mills, 1960).

The ''just-noticeable difference (JND)'' (the [[Sensory threshold|threshold]] at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content. Below 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, the JND is about 3&amp;nbsp;Hz for sine waves, and 1&amp;nbsp;Hz for complex tones; above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the JND for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 [[Cent (music)|cents]]).&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''JND''' is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-21769-8 |pages=171, 248–251 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''JND''' becomes smaller if the two tones are played [[simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]] as the listener is then able to discern [[Beat (acoustics)|beat frequencies]]. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, is 120.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

== JND in speech perception ==
JND analysis is frequently occurring in both music and speech, the two being related and overlapping in the analysis of speech prosody (i.e. speech melody). While several studies have shown that JND for tones (not necessarily sine waves) might normally lie between 5 and 9 semitones (STs), a small percentage of individuals exhibit an accuracy of between a quarter and a half ST (Bachem, 1937). Although JND varies as a function of the frequency band being tested, it has been shown that JND for the best performers at around 1&amp;nbsp;kHz is well below 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, (i.e. less than a tenth of a percent (Ritsma, 1965; Nordmark, 1968; Rakowski, 1971). It is, however, important to be aware of the role played by critical bandwidth when performing this kind of analysis (Nordmark, 1968).

When analysing speech melody, rather than musical tones, accuracy decreases. This is not surprising given that speech does not stay at fixed intervals in the way that tones in music do. Johan 't Hart (1981) found that JND for speech averaged between 1 and 2 STs but concluded that "only differences of more than 3 semitones play a part in communicative situations" ('t Hart, 1981, page 811).

Note that, given the logarithmic characteristics of Hz, for both music and speech perception results should not be reported in Hz but either as percentages or in STs (5&amp;nbsp;Hz between 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;Hz is very different from 5&amp;nbsp;Hz between 2000 and 2005&amp;nbsp;Hz, but the same when reported as a percentage or in STs).

==Marketing applications==
Weber’s law has important applications in [[marketing]]. Manufacturers and marketers endeavor to determine the relevant JND for their products for two very different reasons:

# so that negative changes (e.g. reductions in product size or quality, or increase in product price) are not discernible to the public (i.e. remain below JND) and
# so that product improvements (e.g. improved or updated packaging, larger size or lower price) are very apparent to consumers without being wastefully extravagant (i.e. they are at or just above the JND).

When it comes to product improvements, marketers very much want to meet or exceed the consumer’s differential threshold; that is, they want consumers to readily perceive any improvements made in the original products. Marketers use the JND to determine the amount of improvement they should make in their products. Less than the JND is wasted effort because the improvement will not be perceived; more than the JND is again wasteful because it reduces the level of repeat sales. On the other hand, when it comes to price increases, less than the JND is desirable because consumers are unlikely to notice it.

==Haptics applications==
[[Weber's law]] is used in [[Haptic technology|haptic]] devices and robotic applications. Exerting the proper amount of force to human operator is a critical aspects in human robot interactions and tele operation scenarios. It can highly improve the performance of the user in accomplishing a task.&lt;ref&gt;

The first part of this section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those mass murders where the perpetrators predominantly targeted their (former) co-workers, while the second part focuses on cases where soldiers willfully killed their own comrades.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) shall not be counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the tables are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

'''M. Vänçi Stirnemann''' (born 21 April 1951 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] as ''Manfred Ulrich Stirnemann'') is a Swiss artist, author and curator. He has been active in [[performance art]], [[copy art]] (Xerox art), [[mail art]] and [[installation art]]. In 1997 he initiated the collaborative performance [[artist trading cards]].

==Life==
Stirnemann graduated from the Zurich-based art school F+F founded by progressive artists and art teachers in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Mattmüller, Hansjörg (ed.). F+F Zürich. Das offene Kunststudium. Bern: Benteli, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; His mentor [[Serge Stauffer]] (who translated Marcel Duchamp's writings into German) became a close friend.&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp, Marcel: Die Schriften. Übersetzt, kommentiert und herausgegeben von Serge Stauffer (2 vols.). Zurich: Regenbogen-Verlag, 1981, and Stuttgart: Cantz, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stirnemann, M. Vänçi. ''Kunstvermittlung vor der Bologna-Reform''. In: WOZ, no. 09/2013, 28.02.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Stirnemann studied genres like [[Mannerism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Art Brut]], [[Fluxus]], [[performance art]] and [[media art]], and made himself familiar with artists like [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Dieter Roth]]. In the 1980s, he became known to a wider public with art performances and installations. Until today, he made more than 180 international solo and collaborative performances. Stirnemann is also a curator and editor of art catalogues and art magazines. Since 1983, he publishes the art edition "copy-left".&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://mailartarchive.com/2012/05/07/copy-left-i/ Mail Art Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; As a freelance journalist he published in different newspapers and magazines, and he was an editor at the [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]], a Swiss broadcasting company.

==Work==
In 1986, Stirnemann was founder member of the performance groups ''The Nomads'' and ''a' battery a"''. In 1990, he initiated the international groups ''Feed back and forth'' and ''POW.WOW''. Together with his group ''The Nomads'' he participated in the [[Documenta|documenta 8]] in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;Goedl, Monika, and Manfred Schneckenburger (eds.). documenta 8. Kassel: Weber &amp; Weidemeyer, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Olympic Arts Festival in [[Calgary]], [[Canada]], in 1988. With a grant from the [[Canada Council]] he was Visiting Foreign Artist in Calgary in 1990.

Since the early 1980, Stirnemann participated in [[mail art]] (correspondence art) and realised installations - many of them [[copy art]] projects. As a curator he organized and co-organized various art events and exhibitions, among them the "Kunstszene Zurich" 1991-92 with 260 participating artists and 18 exhibition locations. In 1997, he organized and curated the exposition "FLUXUS AND BEYOND" with the [[fluxus]] artist [[Ben Patterson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://amsquery.stadt-zuerich.ch/Dateien/28/D141033.pdf Archives of the City of Zurich = Stadtarchiv Zürich, V.B. c.900, Drucksachen des Helmhauses, Detailverzeichnis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ken (ed.). The Fluxus Reader. Chicester/New York: Academy Editions, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 onwards, Stirnemann made radio features about modern art for the alternative radio LoRa. As a writer and composer of New Music he worked with musicians and composers, among them Michael Heisch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuemusik.ch/michaelheisch/werkverzeichnis.html Catalogue of works by Michael Heisch]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he opened the second-hand bookshop and gallery "INK art&amp;text" in Zurich which existed until 2006. From 2005–2016, he taught art and design at the Hochschule Luzern in Switzerland.

In 1997, Stirnemann initiated the project [[artist trading cards]], a "collaborative cultural performance" which became a worldwide success. Artist trading Ccrds have the same format as commercial [[trading cards]] but are original artworks or small series, signed and dated on the back-side and swapped between the participants - usually at regularly held trading sessions like they exist in about 30 cities worldwide today. Stirnemann himself has created more than 17,000 artist trading cards, of which he has exchanged more than 14,000. Between 1997 and 2004, he published 333 artist trading card editions with contributions from more than 800 people from 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stirnemann, M. Vänçi (ed.). Artist Trading Cards, issues 1-333 (limited editions of 20, 15 artists each). Zurich, copy-left, 1997-2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ongoing project is his ''subjective encyclopedia'', a collection of comments, images and everyday poetry, each entry assigned to a distinct lemma. About 500 (of more than 1000) lemmata are available on a website.

Stirnemann was awarded grants and distinctions from many different institutions, among them the [[Swiss Federal State]], the canton and the city of Zurich, the canton Aargau, [[Pro Helvetia]], the Cassinelli-Vogel-Stiftung, the [[Canada Council]], and the Stanley Thomas Johnson Foundation. His copy-art projects were supported by [[Xerox]]. 2006-07 he was awarded a grant and a stay at the studio in Paris (Cité Internationale des Arts) from the city of Zurich.

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 13 October 2010 at the 1095th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies&lt;/ref&gt; with 47 member states, reporting directly to its principal organ, the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=fatf-gafi/&gt;

The task of Moneyval is assessing compliance with the principal international standards to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism and the effectiveness of their implementation, as well as making recommendations to national authorities in respect of necessary improvements to their systems.&lt;ref name=fatf-gafi&gt;FATF, [http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/moneyval.html Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1997, the [[Council of Europe]] established the "Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation
of Anti-[[Money Laundering]] Measures", carrying the official [[abbreviation]] of '''PC-R-EV''', as a sub-committee of the European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC, for ''Comité Européen pour les Problèmes Criminels'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/1998%201999%20ENG.pdf  Annual Report 1998-99], Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of PC-R-EV were to be regulated by the general provisions of Resolution Res(2005)47 on committees and subordinate bodies.

In 2002, the name of the committee was changed to "Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism", with the [[abbreviation]] '''Moneyval''', on the grounds that "the abbreviation 'PC-R-EV' does not express the aim of the committee’s activities sufficiently clearly."&lt;ref name=monaco&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=281665&amp;Site=COE Request by the Principality of Monaco to be evaluated by the Select Committee of Experts on the evaluation of anti-money laundering measures], Rapporteur Group on Legal Co-operation, Council of Europe, 13 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

At their meeting of 13 October 2010, the Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution elevating Moneyval, from 1 January 2011, to an "independent monitoring mechanism within the Council of Europe, answerable directly to the [[Committee of Ministers]]".&lt;ref name=council&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/moneyval/About/MONEYVAL_in_brief_en.asp Moneyval in brief], Council of Europe website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9187">[[File:Kelly Miller.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dr. Kelly Miller of Howard University was an organizer and the influential chair of the 1924 Negro Sanhedrin in Chicago.]]

The '''Negro Sanhedrin''' was a national "All-Race Conference" held in the American city of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], from February 11 to 15, 1924. The gathering was attended by 250 delegates representing 61 trade unions, civic groups, and fraternal organizations in a short-lived attempt to forge a national program protecting the legal rights of [[African-American]] [[tenant farmers]] and wage workers and extending the scope of [[civil rights]].

==History==
===Background===
[[File:WMTrotter1915.jpg|thumb|right|160px|William Monroe Trotter of the National Equal Rights League is credited for the idea of the 1924 Negro Sanhedrin in Chicago.]]

The idea for a national conference bringing together representatives of African-American organizations came in the spring of 1923, following [[United States Congress|Congressional]] defeat of the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]].&lt;ref name=Turner113&gt;Joyce Moore Turner with W. Burghardt Turner, ''Caribbean Crusaders and the Harlem Renaissance.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2005; pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Monroe Trotter]] of the [[National Equal Rights League]] (NERL) of [[Boston]] is credited with originating the idea for assembly of a national council of prominent black leaders.&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; This idea was passed along to president of the NERL, [[Matthew A. N. Shaw]], who issued a formal invitation to five like-minded organizations asking for their support.&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt;

Among the groups initially solicited was the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB), a radical semi-underground organization affiliated with the [[Workers Party of America]].&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; Head of the ABB, [[Cyril Briggs]], took the initiative in coordinating such a gathering, initially touted by him as a "United Front Negro Conference of Civil Rights Organizations."&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; On March 24, 1923, a formal document was signed by representatives of the six organizations pledging their support of the conference.&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; In addition to the ABB and NERL, other groups lending their formal support included the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[International Uplift League]], the [[Friends of Freedom]], and the [[National Race Congress]].&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt;

Dean [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]] of [[Howard University]], formally representing the National Race Congress, was chosen as head of the arrangements committee, with Cyril Briggs of the ABB continuing to handle day to day organizational tasks as secretary.&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; Nearly a year of meetings and organizational outreach followed, with the moderate Miller cementing ties with mainstream community and fraternal organizations. It was Miller who chose the name for the gathering,&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; the "[[Sanhedrin]]," a phrase originating in the Biblical [[1 Maccabees|first book of Maccabees]]&lt;ref&gt;1 ''Maccabees'' ch. 11, verse 23; ch. 12, verse 6. Cited in [[Robert A. Hill (Jamaican historian)|Robert A. Hill]] (ed.), ''The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers: Volume 5, September 1922–August 1924.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1986; p. 558, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and referring to a supreme council of the [[Jews|Hebrew people]].&lt;ref name=Gilmore40&gt;Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, ''Defying Dixie: The Radical Roots of Civil Rights, 1919-1950.'' New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2008; p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention===

The Sanhedrin assembled in Chicago on February 11, 1924, attended by 250 delegates representing 61 organizations.&lt;ref name=Gilmore41&gt;Gilmore, ''Defying Dixie,'' p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gathering was attended by organizations ranging across the ideological spectrum, from conservative civic groups to the African Blood Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, ''Defying Dixie,'' pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable number of professionals, scholars, and businesspeople were included among the delegates, who hailed from no fewer than 20 American states.&lt;ref name=Turner113 /&gt; As a result, the gathering was far from radical, with the convention electing Kelly Miller its chairman following a short debate — a decision bitterly opposed by the radical caucus of delegates, which included Briggs and his Workers Party comrades, [[Lovett Fort-Whiteman]], and [[Otto Huiswoud]].&lt;ref name=Gilmore41 /&gt;

===Program===
[[File:Fort-Whiteman-Lovett-1926.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lovett Fort-Whiteman of the Workers Party of America was among the leaders of the left wing minority caucus at the Sanhedrin.]]

Lovett Fort-Whiteman spoke on the floor of the convention for the agenda of radical delegates, headed by Communists and the ABB.&lt;ref name=Gilmore41 /&gt; He urged the adoption of a program calling for an end to [[racial segregation]] in the housing market, termination of [[colonialism]] in Africa, legally binding contracts to protect [[tenant farmers]], abolition of [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and [[diplomatic recognition]] of [[Soviet Russia]] by the United States government, among other things.&lt;ref name=Gilmore4142&gt;Gilmore, ''Defying Dixie,'' pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Resolutions condemning the [[American Federation of Labor]] for allowing its affiliated unions the freedom to exclude black workers from membership and calling for African Americans to join the Communist-sponsored [[Farmer-Labor Party]] were prepared.&lt;ref name=Gilmore42&gt;Gilmore, ''Defying Dixie,'' p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convention chairman Miller short-circuited the agenda of the radicals, however, using his power to appoint an official of the [[Chicago Chamber of Commerce]] as head of the Sanhedrin's Labor Committee.&lt;ref name=Gilmore42 /&gt; This forced the ABB and its allies to bring its proposed resolutions for action directly from the floor of the gathering, a process which ended in failure for its resolutions dealing with [[school segregation]], opposing the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and seeking recognition of Soviet Russia.&lt;ref name=Turner114&gt;Turner with Turner, ''Caribbean Crusaders and the Harlem Renaissance,'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those resolutions which were passed were severely tempered from the preferred wording of the radicals, including a comparatively mild rebuke of labor union locals for exclusion of black members rather than ringing condemnation of the leadership of the American Federation of Labor&lt;ref name=Gilmore42 /&gt; and opining in favor of equal pay for workers without respect to race and organized financial assistance to the struggling agricultural workers being crushed by the agricultural depression that gripped the nation.&lt;ref name=Turner114 /&gt;

The Sanhedrin was [[adjournment sine die|adjourned sine die]] on February 15, 1924.

===Legacy===

The Negro Sanhedrin was the first national gathering of black Americans at which members of the Communist movement openly participated.&lt;ref name=Gilmore4142 /&gt; In the view of one scholar, the Sanhedrin represented "a grand opportunity for mainstream black organizations and black radicals to set aside their differences and formulate a program of mutual benefit."&lt;ref&gt;Herb Boyd, "Radicalism and Resistance: The Evolution of Black Radical Thought," ''The Black Scholar,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 1998), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In this the Sanhedrin was a great failure, with the factional activities of the Communists in Chicago deeply resented and the organization banned from a subsequent and final gathering held in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Turner114 /&gt;

Nor would the Sanhedrin movement be a successful or lasting vehicle for the coordination of activity by the myriad of mainstream black organizations, with momentum dissipating almost immediately after the close of the Chicago gathering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17238">The '''normalcy bias''', or '''normality bias''', is a belief people hold when facing a disaster. It causes people to underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster and its possible effects, because people believe that things will always function the way things normally have functioned. This may result in situations where people fail to adequately prepare themselves for disasters, and on a larger scale, the failure of governments to include the populace in its [[disaster preparation]]s. About 70% of people reportedly display normalcy bias in disasters.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=The frozen calm of normalcy bias|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-frozen-calm-of-normalcy-bias-486764924|accessdate=23 May 2017|publisher=Gizmodo|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Amanda Ripley]] identified common response patterns of people in disasters and found that there are three phases of response: Denial, Deliberation and the Decisive Moment. The faster people can get through the Denial and Deliberation phase, the quicker they will reach the Decisive Moment and begin to take action.

The normalcy bias can manifest itself in various disasters, ranging from car crashes to world-historical events. It is hypothesized that the normalcy bias may be caused by the way the brain processes new information. Stress slows information processing, and when the brain cannot find an acceptable response to a situation, it fixates on a single and sometimes default solution. This single resolution can result in unnecessary injury or death in disaster situations. The lack of preparation for disasters often leads to inadequate shelter, supplies, and evacuation plans. Thus, normalcy bias can cause people to drastically underestimate the effects of the disaster and assume that everything will be all right. The negative effects of normalcy bias can be combatted through the four stages of disaster response: preparation, warning, impact, and aftermath.

== Phases ==
[[Amanda Ripley]], author of ''The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes&amp;nbsp;– and Why'', identifies common response patterns of people in disasters and explains that there are three phases of response: Denial, Deliberation and the Decisive Moment. With regard to the first phase, described as Denial, Ripley found that people were likely to deny that a disaster was happening. It takes time for the brain to process information and recognize that a disaster is a threat. In the Deliberation phase, people have to decide what to do. If the person does not have a plan in place, this creates a serious problem because the effects of life-threatening stress on the body (e.g. tunnel vision, audio exclusion, time dilations, [[out-of-body experience]]s, or reduced motor skills) limit an individual's ability to perceive information and make plans. Ripley asserts that in the third and final phase, described as the Decisive Moment, a person must act quickly and decisively. Failure to do so can result in injury or death. She explains that the faster someone can get through the Denial and Deliberation phase, the quicker they will reach the Decisive Moment and begin to take action.&lt;ref name="Ripley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ripley|first1=Amanda|author-link=Amanda Ripley|title=The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes&amp;nbsp;– and Why|date=June 10, 2008|publisher=Potter/[[Ten Speed Press]]/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-44927-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

[[File:Crushed Saturn.jpg|thumb|Normalcy bias can occur during car crashes.]]
"Normalcy bias flows into the brain no matter the scale of the problem," journalist David McRaney has written. "It will appear whether you have days and plenty of warning or are blindsided with only seconds between life and death."&lt;ref name="You Are Not So Smart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McRaney|first1=David|title=You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself|date=2012|publisher=Gotham Books|isbn=978-1-59240-736-1|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Dj_ZCwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can manifest itself in phenomena such as car crashes. Car crashes occur very frequently, but the average individual experiences them only rarely, if ever. It also manifests itself in connection with events in world history. According to a 2001 study by sociologist Thomas Drabek, when people are asked to leave in anticipation of a disaster, most check with four or more sources of information before deciding what to do. The process of checking in, known as milling, is common in disasters.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

A website for police officers has noted that members of that profession have "all seen videos of officers who were injured or killed while dealing with an ambiguous situation, like the old one of a father with his young daughter on a traffic stop". In a video referred to, "the officer misses multiple threat cues...because the assailant talks lovingly about his daughter and jokes about how packed his minivan is. The officer only seems to react to the positive interactions, while seeming to ignore the negative signals. It's almost as if the officer is thinking, 'Well I've never been brutally assaulted before so it certainly won't happen now.' No one is surprised at the end of the video when the officer is violently attacked, unable to put up an effective defense." This professional failure, notes the website, is a consequence of normalcy bias.&lt;ref name="Police Mag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dave|title=Normalcy Bias|url=http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2015/08/normalcy-bias.aspx|website=Police The Law Enforcement Magazine|publisher=Police The Law Enforcement Magazine|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalcy bias, David McRaney has written, "is often factored into fatality predictions in everything from ship sinkings to stadium evacuations." Disaster movies, he adds, "get it all wrong. When you and others are warned of danger, you don’t evacuate immediately while screaming and flailing your arms." McRaney notes that in the book ''Big Weather'', [[tornado chaser]] Mark Svenvold discusses "how contagious normalcy bias can be. He recalled how people often tried to convince him to chill out while fleeing from impending doom. Even when tornado warnings were issued, people assumed it was someone else's problem. Stake-holding peers, he said, would try to shame him into denial so they could remain calm. They didn't want him deflating their attempts at feeling normal".&lt;ref name="You Are Not So Smart" /&gt;

People who promote conspiracy theories or apocalyptic future scenarios have cited the normalcy bias as a prime reason why others scoff at their pronouncements. For example, survivalists who fear that the U.S. will soon descend into [[totalitarianism]] cite normalcy bias as the reason why most Americans do not share their worries. Similarly, fundamentalist Christians use the normalcy bias to explain why others scoff at their beliefs about the "[[End Time]]". One fundamentalist website writes: "May we not get blinded by the 'normalcy bias' but rather live with the knowledge that the Lord’s coming is near."&lt;ref name="Relevant Bible Teaching"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Normalcy Bias|url=http://www.relevantbibleteaching.com/site/cpage.asp?cpage_id=140031178&amp;sec_id=140001239|website=Relevant Bible Teaching|publisher=Relevant Bible Teaching|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prophezine" /&gt;

== Hypothesized cause ==
The normalcy bias may be caused in part by the way the brain processes new data. Research suggests that even when the brain is calm, it takes 8–10 seconds to process new information. Stress slows the process, and when the brain cannot find an acceptable response to a situation, it fixates on a single and sometimes default solution that may or may not be correct. An evolutionary reason for this response could be that paralysis gives an animal a better chance of surviving an attack and predators are less likely to see prey that is not moving.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web | last = Ripley | first = Amanda | authorlink = Amanda Ripley | title = How to Get Out Alive | publisher = TIME Magazine | date = 25 April 2005 | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053663-1,00.html | accessdate = 11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

About 70% of people reportedly display normalcy bias in disasters.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=The frozen calm of normalcy bias|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-frozen-calm-of-normalcy-bias-486764924|accessdate=23 May 2017|publisher=Gizmodo|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normalcy bias has been described as "one of the most dangerous biases we have". The lack of preparation for disasters often leads to inadequate shelter, supplies, and evacuation plans. Even when all these things are in place, individuals with a normalcy bias often refuse to leave their homes.&lt;ref name="Gerold Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beware Your Dangerous Normalcy Bias|url=https://geroldblog.com/2013/04/26/beware-your-dangerous-normalcy-bias/|website=Gerold Blog|publisher=Gerold Blog|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalcy bias can cause people to drastically underestimate the effects of the disaster. Therefore, people think that they will be safe even though information from the radio, television, or neighbors gives them reasons to believe there is a risk. The normalcy bias creates a [[cognitive dissonance]] that people then must work to eliminate. Some manage to eliminate it by refusing to believe new warnings coming in and refusing to evacuate (maintaining the normalcy bias), while others eliminate the dissonance by escaping the danger. The possibility that some people may refuse to evacuate causes significant problems in disaster planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Oda | first = Katsuya | title = Information Technology for Advancement of Evacuation | publisher = National Institute for Land and Infrastructure Management | url = http://www.ysk.nilim.go.jp/kakubu/engan/engan/taigai/hapyoronbun/07-17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear peace''' is a theory of [[international relations]] that argues that under some circumstances [[nuclear weapon]]s can induce stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation. In particular, nuclear weapons are said to have induced stability during the [[Cold War]], when both the [[US]] and the [[USSR]] possessed mutual [[second strike]] retaliation capability, eliminating the possibility of nuclear victory for either side. Proponents of nuclear peace argue that controlled [[nuclear proliferation]] may be beneficial for inducing stability. Critics of nuclear peace argue that nuclear proliferation not only increases the chance of [[nuclear war|interstate nuclear conflict]], but increases the chances of [[nuclear material]] falling into the hands of [[violent non-state actor|violent]] [[non-state actor|non-state groups]] who are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation.

The major debate on this issue has been between [[Kenneth Waltz]], the founder of [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist theory]] in international relations, and [[Scott Sagan]], a leading proponent of organizational theories in international politics. Waltz generally argues that "more may be better," contending that new [[nuclear state]]s will use their acquired nuclear capabilities to [[nuclear deterrence|deter]] threats and preserve peace.  Sagan argues that "more will be worse", since new nuclear states often lack adequate organizational controls over their new weapons, which makes for a high risk of either deliberate or accidental nuclear war, or theft of nuclear material by [[terrorist]]s to perpetrate [[nuclear terrorism]].

== Argument ==
A nuclear peace results when the costs of war are unacceptably high for both sides. In a two-sided conflict where both sides have mutual second strike capability, defense becomes impossible so it is the very prospect of fighting the war, rather than the possibility of losing it, that induces restraint.

In a condition of [[mutually assured destruction]], there are [[civilian]] "[[hostage]]s" on both sides, which facilitates cooperation by acting as an informal mechanism of contract enforcement between states. There are economic equivalents of such informal mechanisms used to effect credible commitment; for example, [[corporation]]s use "hostages" (in the form of initial setup costs that act as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]) to deter [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] and [[franchisee]]s from cheating.

Nuclear weapons may also lessen a [[sovereign state|state]]'s reliance on [[allies]] for [[national security|security]], thus preventing allies from dragging each other into wars (a phenomenon known as [[chain ganging]], frequently said to be a major [[cause of World War I]]).

Since the death of civilians is an essential part of mutually assured destruction, one normative consequence of nuclear weapons is that [[war]] loses its historical function as a symbol of glory and measure of national strength.

As a method of preventing a destabilizing [[arms race]], the concept of [[minimal deterrence]] represents one way of solving the [[security dilemma]] and avoiding an arms race.

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' in 2009 [[quantitative research|quantitatively evaluated]] the nuclear peace [[hypothesis]] and found support for the existence of the [[stability-instability paradox]]. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability and prevent largescale wars, they simultaneously allow for more [[low intensity conflict|lower intensity conflicts]]. When a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and one state has nuclear weapons and its opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/53/2/258.short Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis A Quantitative Approach.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of argument ==
Critics argue that war can occur even under conditions of mutually assured destruction:

Actors are not always rational, as bureaucratic procedure and internal intrigue may cause subrational outcomes. Related to and reinforcing that point is that there is always an element of uncertainty. One cannot always control emotions, subordinates, and equipment, especially when one has limited information and is faced with high stakes and fast timetables. There are [[unintended consequence]]s, unwanted escalation, irrationality, misperception, and the [[security dilemma]].

Another reason is that deterrence has an inherent instability. As Kenneth Boulding said: "If deterrence were really stable… it would cease to deter." If decisionmakers were perfectly rational, they would never order the largescale use of nuclear weapons, and the credibility of the nuclear threat would be low.

However, that apparent perfect rationality criticism is countered and so not inconsistent with current deterrence policy. In ''[[Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence]]'', the authors detail an explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding "what is permitted" for other nations and its endorsement of "irrationality" or, more precisely, the perception thereof as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy. The document claims that the capacity of the United States, in exercising deterrence, would be hurt by portraying US leaders as fully rational and cool-headed: 

{{quote|The fact that some elements may appear to be potentially 'out of control' can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing fears and doubts in the minds of an adversary's decision makers. This essential sense of fear is the working force of deterrence. That the U.S. may become irrational and vindictive if its vital interests are attacked should be part of the national persona we project to all adversaries.}}

Some commentators critical of the concept of nuclear peace further make the argument that nonstate actors and rogue states could supply nuclear weapons to [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist]] organizations and thereby undermine conventional deterrence and therefore nuclear peace, especially with the existence of international terrorist networks seeking access to nuclear sources.

However [[Robert Gallucci]], president of the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe, "the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallucci|first=Robert|title=Averting Nuclear Catastrophe: Contemplating Extreme Responses to U.S. Vulnerability|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2006|volume= 607|pages=51–58|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/607/1/51.abstract|accessdate=28 January 2013|doi=10.1177/0002716206290457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graham Allison]] makes a similar case and argues that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material: "After a nuclear bomb detonates, [[nuclear forensics|nuclear forensic]] cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allison|first=Graham|title=How to Keep the Bomb From Terrorists|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/03/13/how-to-keep-the-bomb-from-terrorists.html|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=Newsweek|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints: "The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4029">The '''omission bias''' is an alleged type of [[cognitive bias]]. It is the tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral than equally harmful omissions (inactions) because actions are more obvious than inactions. It is contentious as to whether this represents a systematic error in thinking, or is supported by a substantive [[moral theory]]. For a [[consequentialist]], judging harmful actions as worse than inaction would indeed be inconsistent, but [[deontological]] ethics may, and normally does, draw a moral distinction between doing and allowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Frances |last= Howard-Snyder|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/doing-allowing/|title= Doing vs. Allowing Harm|edition=|year=2011|journal=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias is usually showcased through the [[trolley problem]].

==Examples and applications==

Spranca, Minsk and Baron extended the omission bias to judgments of morality of choices. In one scenario, John, a tennis player, would be facing a tough opponent the next day in a decisive match. John knows his opponent is allergic to a food substance. Subjects were presented with two conditions: John recommends the food containing the allergen to hurt his opponent's performance, or the opponent himself orders the allergenic food, and John says nothing. A majority of people judged that John's action of recommending the allergenic food as being more immoral than John's inaction of not informing the opponent of the allergenic substance.&lt;ref name="SprancaMinsk1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spranca|first1=Mark|last2=Minsk|first2=Elisa|last3=Baron|first3=Jonathan|title=Omission and commission in judgment and choice|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=27|issue=1|year=1991|pages=76–105| url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/oc.html| doi=10.1016/0022-1031(91)90011-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''overlapping generations model''', abbreviated to '''OLG model''', is a type of representative agent [[economics|economic]] model in which [[Agent (economics)|agents]] live a finite length of time long enough to overlap with at least one period of another agent's life.  As it models explicitly the different periods of life, - such as schooling, working or retirement periods --, it is the natural framework to study the allocation of resources
across the different generations.

== History ==
The concept of an OLG model was inspired by [[Irving Fisher]]'s monograph ''The Theory of Interest''.&lt;ref name="ABB29"&gt;{{harvtxt|Aliprantis|Brown|Burkinshaw|1988|p=229}}:&lt;p&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aliprantis |first1=Charalambos&amp;nbsp;D.|authorlink1=Charalambos D. Aliprantis| last2=Brown|first2=Donald&amp;nbsp;J.|last3=Burkinshaw|first3=Owen|title=Existence and optimality of competitive equilibria|chapter=5 The overlapping generations model (pp.&amp;nbsp;229–271)|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|date=April 1988|edition=1990 student|pages=xii+284|isbn=3-540-52866-0|mr=1075992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable improvements were published by [[Maurice Allais]] in 1947,  [[Paul Samuelson]] in 1958, and [[Peter Diamond]] in 1965. Books devoted to the use of the OLG model include [[Costas Azariadis|Azariadis]]' Intertemporal Macroeconomics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wiley: Intertemporal Macroeconomics - Costas Azariadis|url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1557863660.html|website = eu.wiley.com|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David de la Croix|de la Croix]] and [[Philippe Michel (economist)|Michel]]'s Theory of Economic Growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Theory of Economic Growth - 9780521001151 - Cambridge University Press|url = https://www.cambridge.org/asia/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521001151|website = www.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic model==

[[File:OLG model- Generation.png|thumb|Generational Shifts in OLG Models]]
The most basic OLG model has the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="LjungqvistSargent2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lars Ljungqvist|author2=Thomas J. Sargent|title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory|date=1 September 2004|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-12274-0|pages = 264–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individuals live for '''two''' periods; in the first period of life, they are referred to as the '''Young'''. In the second period of life, they are referred to as the '''Old'''.
*A number of individuals are born in every period. &lt;math&gt;N^{t}_t &lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of individuals born in period t.
*&lt;math&gt;N^{t-1}_t &lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of old people in period t. Since the economy begins in period 1, in period 1 there is a group of people who are already old. They are referred to as the ''initial old.'' The number of them can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;N_0 &lt;/math&gt; .
*The size of the initial old generation is normalized to 1: &lt;math&gt;N^{0}_0 =1&lt;/math&gt;.
*People do not die early, so &lt;math&gt;N^{t}_t = N^{t}_{t+1} &lt;/math&gt;.
*Population grows at a constant rate n:
::&lt;math&gt; N_t^t = (1+n)^t &lt;/math&gt;

*In the "pure exchange economy" version of the model, there is only one physical good and it cannot endure for more than one period. Each individual receives a fixed endowment of this good at birth. This endowment is denoted as ''y''. 
*In the "production economy" version of the model (see Diamond OLG model below), the physical good can be either consumed or invested to build physical capital. Output is produced from labor and physical capital. Each household is endowed with one unit of time which is inelastically supply on the labor market.
*Preferences over consumption streams are given by
::&lt;math&gt; u(c_t^t,c_t^{t+1}) =  U(c_t^t) + \beta U(c_t^{t+1}),&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of time preference.

==Attributes==

One important aspect of the OLG model is that the steady state equilibrium need not be efficient, in contrast to general equilibrium models where the [[First Welfare Theorem]] guarantees Pareto efficiency. Because there are an infinite number of agents in the economy (summing over future time), the total value of resources is infinite, so Pareto improvements can be made by transferring resources from each young generation to the current old generation. Not every equilibrium is inefficient; the efficiency of an equilibrium is strongly linked to the interest rate and the [[Cass Criterion]] gives [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s for when an OLG competitive equilibrium allocation is inefficient.&lt;ref name="Cass72"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cass| first1 = David | authorlink=David Cass| year=1972 |title= On capital overaccumulation in the aggregative neoclassical model of economic growth: a complete characterization | journal =[[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume = 4| pages = 200–223 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90149-4 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attribute of OLG type models is that it is possible that 'over saving' can occur when capital accumulation is added to the model—a situation which could be improved upon by a social planner by forcing households to draw down their capital stocks.&lt;ref name="Diamond65"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond| first1 = Peter | authorlink=Peter Diamond| year=1965 |title= National debt in a neoclassical growth model | journal =[[American Economic Review]] | volume = 55| pages = 1126–1150 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, certain restrictions on the underlying technology of production and consumer tastes can ensure that the steady state level of saving corresponds to the [[Golden Rule savings rate]] of the [[Solow growth model]] and thus guarantee intertemporal efficiency. Along the same lines, most empirical research on the subject has noted that oversaving does not seem to be a major problem in the real world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A third fundamental contribution of OLG models is that they justify existence of money as a medium of exchange. A system of expectations exists as an equilibrium in which each new young generation accepts money from the previous old generation in exchange for consumption. They do this because they expect to be able to use that money to purchase consumption when they are the old generation.&lt;ref name="LjungqvistSargent2004"/&gt;

OLG models allow us to look at intergenerational redistribution and systems such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Imrohoroglu | first1= Selahattin | last2=Imrohoroglu | first2 =Ayse | last3= Joines | first3= Douglas | year=1999 | title=Social Security in an Overlapping Generations Economy with Land | journal = Review of Economic Dynamics | volume =2 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

A OLG model with an aggregate neoclassical production was constructed by [[Peter Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond65"/&gt; A two-sector OLG model was developed by [[Oded Galor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galor| first1 = Oded | authorlink=Oded Galor  |year=1992 |title= A Two-Sector Overlapping-Generations Model: A Global Characterization of the Dynamical System| journal =[[Econometrica]] | volume = 60| pages = 1351–1386 | jstor=2951525 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike  the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]] the steady state level of capital need not be unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galor| first1 = Oded | authorlink=Oded Galor | last2 = Ryder| first2 = Harl E. |year=1989 |title= Existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium in an overlapping-generations model with productive capital| journal =[[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume = 49| pages = 360–375 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(89)90088-4 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as demonstrated by Diamond (1965), the steady-state level of the capital labor ratio need not be efficient which is termed as "[[dynamic efficiency|dynamic inefficiency]]".

===Diamond OLG Model===
[[File:OLG Model - Diamond.png|thumb|Convergence of OLG Economy to Steady State]]
The economy has the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrol|first=Christopher|title=OLG Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Two generations are alive at any point in time, the young (age 1) and old (age 2).
*The size of the young generation in period t is given by N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =  N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;.
*Households work only in the first period of their life and earn Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; income. They earn no income in the second period of their life (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; =  0)
*They consume part of their first period income and save the rest to finance their consumption when old.
*At the end of period t, the assets of the young are the source of the capital used for aggregate production in period t+1.So K&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the assets per young household after their consumption in period 1. In addition to this there is no depreciation.
*The old in period t own the entire capital stock and consume it entirely, so dissaving by the old in period t is given by N&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Labor and capital markets are perfectly competitive and the aggregate production technology is CRS, Y = F(K,L).

In Diamond's version of the model, individuals tend to save more than is socially optimal, leading to dynamic inefficiency. Subsequent work has investigated whether dynamic inefficiency is a characteristic in some economies&lt;ref name="Mankiw89"&gt;{{cite news|author1=N. Gregory Mankiw|author2=Lawrence H. Summers|author3=Richard J. Zeckhauser|title=Assessing Dynamic Efficiency: Theory and Evidence|date=1 May 1989|journal =[[Review of Economic Studies]] | volume = 56| pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.2307/2297746 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether government programs to transfer wealth from young to poor do reduce dynamic inefficiency{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

'''Pop art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] during the mid- to late-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/pop-art ''Pop Art: A Brief History'', MoMA Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;Livingstone, M., ''Pop Art: A Continuing History'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The movement presented a challenge to traditions of [[fine art]] by including imagery from [[popular culture|popular]] and [[mass culture]], such as [[advertising]], [[comic books]] and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ages"&gt;de la Croix, H.; Tansey, R., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in [[UK|Britain]], and [[Larry Rivers]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] among others in the [[United States]]. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of [[abstract expressionism]], as well as an expansion of those ideas.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Due to its utilization of [[found objects]] and images, it is similar to [[Dada]]. Pop art and [[minimalism]] are considered to be art movements that precede [[postmodern art]], or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Harrison| first=Sylvia |title=Pop Art and the Origins of Post-Modernism| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=2001-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'', by [[Andy Warhol]]. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol's]] ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,'' 1964 (pictured).

==Origins==
The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to [[Hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] composition and [[Representation (arts)|representational art]]. They used impersonal, mundane reality, [[irony]], and [[parody]] to "defuse" the personal symbolism and "[[painterly]] looseness" of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high"&gt;Gopnik, A.; Varnedoe, K., ''High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture'', New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., some artwork by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Man Ray]] anticipated pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/alex-katz-is-cooler-than-ever-34462293/ |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the origins of pop art in [[Post-war|post-War]] Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by [[American popular culture]] ''when viewed from afar''.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of [[Dadaism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].

===Proto-pop===
[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'' 1928,  collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]] ]]
Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others in Europe like [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Man Ray]] predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American ''proto-pop'' origins which utilized "as found" cultural objects.&lt;ref name="iha"&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p486-487.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, American artists [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost "prefiguring" the pop art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=Modern Love |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and .'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom: the Independent Group==
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]'s collage ''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' (1956) is one of the earliest works to be considered "pop art".|alt=A collage of many different styles shows a mostly naked man and woman in a house.]]

The [[Independent Group]] (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;Arnason, H., ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] presented a lecture using a series of [[collage]]s titled ''Bunk!'' that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; This material of "found objects" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented ''American'' popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947), which includes the first use of the word "pop", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-i-was-a-rich-mans-plaything-t01462 |title='I was a Rich Man's Plaything', Sir Eduardo Paolozzi |publisher=Tate |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

According to the son of [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], the term "pop art" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with [[Frank Cordell]],&lt;ref name="Warholstars.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/articles/johnmchale/johnmchale.html |title=John McHale |website=Warholstars.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources credit its origin to British critic [[Lawrence Alloway]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art'', Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Michael Clarke, Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (Both versions agree that the term was used in [[Independent Group]] discussions by mid-1955.)

"Pop art" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term "pop art" first appeared in published print in the article "But Today We Collect Ads" by IG members [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] in Ark magazine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Alison and Peter Smithson, "But Today We Collect Ads", reprinted on page 54 in ''Modern Dreams The Rise and Fall of Pop'', published by ICA and MIT, {{ISBN|0-262-73081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often credited to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[art critic]]/[[curator]] [[Lawrence Alloway]] for his 1958 essay titled ''The Arts and the Mass Media'', even though the precise language he uses is "popular mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "The Arts and the Mass Media," Architectural Design &amp; Construction, February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; "Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation..."&lt;ref name="Honnef"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KRtCl1nFSV8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22term+pop+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi44ePWpubWAhVEYlAKHe-2AtEQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22term%20pop%20art%22&amp;f=false Klaus Honnef, ''Pop Art'', Taschen, 2004], p. 6, {{ISBN|3822822183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.&lt;ref name="Honnef" /&gt;

In London, the annual [[Royal Society of British Artists|Royal Society of British Artists (RBA)]] exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-''Young Contemporaries'' of all put [[David Hockney]], the American [[R B Kitaj]], New Zealander [[Billy Apple]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]], [[Derek Boshier]], [[Joe Tilson]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]] and [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Christina|title=Billy Apple: British and American Works 1960-69|year=2010|publisher=The Mayor Gallery|location=London|isbn=978-0-9558367-3-2|pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21" /&gt;

==United States==
Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term "pop art" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a "Symposium on Pop Art" organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="SchermanTony"&gt;Scherman, Tony. "When Pop Turned the Art World Upside Down." ''American Heritage'' 52.1 (February 2001), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements and inflections of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;

Two important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; While the paintings of Rauschenberg have relationships to the earlier work of [[Kurt Schwitters]] and other [[Dada]] artists, his concern was for the social issues of the moment. His approach was to create art out of ephemeral materials. By using topical events in the life of everyday America, he gave his work a unique quality.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Sandler|Sandler, Irving H.]] ''The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978. {{ISBN|0-06-438505-1}} pp. 174–195, ''Rauschenberg and Johns''; pp. 103–111, ''Rivers and the gestural realists''.&lt;/ref&gt; Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is classified as [[Neo-Dada]], and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Jasper Johns" ''Art International'' (September 1960): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood,  Susan, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958-62''. New York: Universe Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheddar Cheese crop from Campbells Soup Cans MOMA.jpg|thumb|The ''Cheddar Cheese'' canvas from [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962.]]
[[Roy Lichtenstein]] is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of [[parody]], probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' is part of the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].)&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Janis|title=Roy Lichtenstein|year=1988|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|isbn=3-8228-0281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work features thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, "[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.

The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, [[Tom Wesselmann]] and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; 

Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol "the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;  Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, Annette, Buchloh, B.

===Early U.S. exhibitions===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] had their first shows in the [[Judson Memorial Church#Sponsorship of the arts|Judson Gallery]] in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] and others at the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed [[Installation art|installations]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]], ''New Media - New Forms'' featured [[Hans Arp]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Jasper Johns]], Claes Oldenburg, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], Jim Dine and [[May Wilson]]. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, ''Environments, Situations, Spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O:AD:E:4397&amp;page_number=12&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection |website=MoMA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsm1/n1m651.htm |title=The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the Sixties |website=Tfaoi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at [[Ferus Gallery|Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery]], where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;

Donald Factor, the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]], and an art collector and co-editor of [[avant-garde]] [[literary magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']], wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, ''Nomad/New York''. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, "Four Artists", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name="Diggory"&gt;Diggory (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many ''[[happening]]s'', which were [[performance art]]-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was "Ray Gun Theater". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]] and [[Richard Artschwager]]; dealer Annina Nosei; [[art critic]] [[Barbara Rose]]; and screenwriter [[Rudy Wurlitzer]].&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-02/entertainment/ca-19310_1_claes-oldenburg When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with "profound" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]] to house ''The Store'', a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Opening in 1962, [[Willem de Kooning]]'s New York art dealer, the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery, organized the groundbreaking ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian ''[[New Realism]]'', and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting [[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, [[Robert Indiana]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (''The Love Wall'' from 1961), [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Christo]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]]. The show was seen by Europeans [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Jean Tinguely]] in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were [[Marisol Escobar|Marisol]], [[Mario Schifano]], [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Öyvind Fahlström]]. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when [[Mark Rothko]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Philip Guston]] quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLgyznMrORsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=New+Realism+at+Sidney+Janis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2CQXoBBdiS&amp;sig=HBQNsOqvkZvHEEFnWhnhTls-EH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=07IbS67CA4TBlAeTt63vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Realism%20at%20Sidney%20Janis&amp;f=false |title=Andy Warhol, Poetry, and Gossip in the 1960s |author=Reva Wolf |page=83 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: "at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt; Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.

A bit earlier, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; [[Phillip Hefferton]] and [[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]] from Detroit; [[Edward Ruscha]] and [[Joe Goode]] from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortonsimon.org/about/history.aspx |title=Museum History » Norton Simon Museum |website=Nortonsimon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] exhibited ''Six Painters and the Object'', curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/360205683 |title=Six painters and the object.

The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the [[Tate Gallery]]'s ''Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayford|first=Martin|title=Still life at the check-out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3587307/Still-life-at-the-check-out.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=2002-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The [[Ferus Gallery]] presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1963). In New York, the [[Green Gallery]] showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The [[Stable Gallery]] showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;''Pop Artists: Andy Warhol, Pop Art, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Peter Max, Erró, David Hockney, Wally Hedrick, Michael Leavitt'' (May 20, 2010) Reprinted: 2010, General Books, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, {{ISBN|978-1-155-48349-8}}, {{ISBN|1-155-48349-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the ''[[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967]]'' featured the "Who's Who" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the ''classical phase'' of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were [[Edward Hopper]], [[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Edwards, William Emboden, David McCarthy: ''Uncommonplaces: The Art of James Francis Gill'', 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
''[[Nouveau réalisme]]'' refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the "new figurative", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of "pop" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.

Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the "Chronicle Team" (''El Equipo Crónica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Valdés]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as "pop" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almodóvar]] emerged from Madrid's "La Movida" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film "Funny Face" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.

==Japan==
In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.&lt;ref name="eskolahk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview – Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.

==Italy==
In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the "Scuola di Piazza del Popolo" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].

Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a "gold mine" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.

The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside "domestic walls" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the "new world", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of "let me have fun" à la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 — Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], pop art was represented by [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]], whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous êtes doll? "'') and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.

==Netherlands==
While there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art &amp; The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s. Russia was a communist country at that point and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power and the Russian revolution was beginning, and with it came a freedom to express. That is when pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. One might argue that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Powered by the Apocalypse''' (PbtA) is a [[role-playing game system]] developed for the 2010 game ''[[Apocalypse World]]'' and also used for ''[[Dungeon World]]'', ''[[Monsterhearts]]'' and numerous other RPGs.  ''Apocalypse World'' won the 2010 Indie RPG Awards for ''Most Innovative Game''&lt;ref name="Innovation Award"&gt;[http://www.rpg-awards.com/2010/most_innovate.shtml Most Innovative] – 2010 Indie RPG Awards&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dungeon World]] won the 2013 [[ENnie award]] for ''Best Rules''.&lt;ref name="2013 ENnies"&gt;[http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/about-us/2013-noms-and-winners-2/ 2013 ENnie Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==

Powered by the Apocalypse games are centered around resolving what characters do as Moves. Characters have access to a default selection of moves based on the expectations of the game setting. In the fantasy game, ''Dungeon World'', characters have access to a [[hack and slash]] move, as combat is central to the dungeoneering experience. Alternatively, ''Apocalypse World'' has a "seize by force" move, as the game assumes a setting where collecting scarce resources is part of the game-play experience. ''Apocalypse World'', ''Dungeon World'', and most other PbtA games are [[character class|class based]]. Character classes have access to a number of class-specific moves.

Moves are resolved by rolling two six-sided dice and adding the relevant modifier, should modifiers be a mechanic in the game. Success levels fall on a scale of total success, partial success, or failure - referred to as a "miss" in the system.

==Published games using the Powered by the Apocalypse system==
Because of the simplicity and the flexibility of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine, and [[Vincent Baker]]'s encouragement of publishing hacks,&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;[http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=29.0 Forum statement] – [[Vincent Baker]], 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; there are at least four dozen fan-made hacks that have reached the point of public playtesting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPfff5dSHsk__rFHGQfLaAmb3ns680s_Fc0CSNlhfFA/edit?pli=1# Big List of Apocalypse World hacks]&lt;/ref&gt;  This list only covers the ones actually published.

The '''Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom''', or '''Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington''', was a 1957 demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]], an early event in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and the occasion for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[Give Us the Ballot]]" speech.

==Background==
The demonstration was planned at the occasion of the third anniversary of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision against [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in public schools. The event organizers urged the government to abide by that decision, as the process of desegregation was being obstructed at local and state levels.

The march was organized by [[A. Philip Randolph]],&lt;ref name=crdl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crdl.usg.edu/voci/go/crdl/events/viewEvent/1055;jsessionid=B965F35467CE28610711C596B4E1E0E4 |title=Prayer Pilgrimage for freedom, Washington, D.C. |author=Civil Rights Digital Library |accessdate=March 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227025609/http://crdl.usg.edu/voci/go/crdl/events/viewEvent/1055 |archivedate=December 27, 2008 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayard Rustin]],&lt;ref name=mlk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_prayer_pilgrimage_for_freedom_1957/ |title=Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom (1957) |author=The Martin Luther King Jr. Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ella Baker]]. It was supported by the [[NAACP]] and the recently founded [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. Congressman [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]] had asked the planners not to embarrass the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]], thus the event was organized as a prayer commemoration.&lt;ref name=mlk/&gt; A call for the demonstration was issued on April 5, 1957, by Randolph, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Roy Wilkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_prayer_pilgrimage_for_freedom_1957/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
The three-hour demonstration took place in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] participated in the event. [[Paul Robeson]] and his wife [[Eslanda Robeson|Eslanda]] attended, but were largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Martin Duberman]]| title=Paul Robeson |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, 1988| page=447f| isbn=0-394-52780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the speakers were Wilkins, [[Mordecai Johnson]], and King. King was the last speaker and it was the first time that he addressed a national audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2008/03/31/in_depth_us/timeline3982827_0_content.shtml CBS: May 17, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm |title=Prayer Pilgrimage to DC for Civil Rights| author=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement |accessdate= March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first Lincoln Memorial speech and it set the goal and agenda for voting rights as an important part of the civil rights struggle against a reluctant administration.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/180471/page/1 |author=David J.

At the time, the event was the largest demonstration ever organized for civil rights.

King's oratory at the event is named the "Give Us the Ballot" speech, as its key section uses this demand as a [[litany]], followed by a listing of changes that would result by African Americans regaining voting rights:

In [[law]], a '''prerogative''' is an [[exclusive right]] given from a [[government]] or [[State (polity)|state]] and invested in an individual or group, the content of which is separate from the body of rights enjoyed under the general [[law]] of the normative state. It was a common facet of [[Feudalism|feudal law]]. The word is derived from O.Fr. ''prerogative'' (14c.), M.L. ''prerogativa'' "special right," from L. ''[[Prorogatio|praerogativa]]'' "prerogative, previous choice or election," originally (with [[Roman assemblies#Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|tribus]], [[Roman assemblies#Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|centuria]]) "unit of 100 voters who by lot voted first in the Roman [[Roman assemblies#Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|comitia]]," from ''praerogativus'' (adj.) "chosen to vote first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=prerogative|accessdate=30 September 2012|author=[[Douglas Harper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[popular culture]] usage, the word prerogative has come to mean the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] condition of the right for anyone's own [[self-determination]], e.g., that it is "one's prerogative" to do as they please. The antithesis of the legal historic use of the term, being private exclusion from anyone and determined to the individual from without.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">In [[propositional calculus]], a '''propositional function''' is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of [[logical truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]], except that within the sentence there is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] (''x'') that is not defined or specified, which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. ''n'' variables, in which case the function takes ''n'' arguments).

As a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], ''A''(''x'') or ''A''(''x''{{sub|1}}, ''x''{{sub|2}}, ..., ''x''{{sub|''n''}}), the propositional function is abstracted from [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] or propositional forms.  As an example, let's imagine the predicate, "x is hot".  The substitution of any entity for ''x'' will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though "''x'' is hot" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement.  However, when you assign ''x'' a value, such as [[lava]], the function then has the value ''true''; while if you assign ''x'' a value like [[ice]], the function then has the value ''false''.

Propositional functions are useful in [[set theory]] for the formation of [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. For example, in 1903 [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in [[The Principles of Mathematics]] (page 106):
:"...it has become necessary to take ''propositional function'' as a [[primitive notion]].

Later Russell examined the problem of whether propositional functions were predicative or not, and he proposed two theories to try to get at this question: the zig-zag theory and the ramified theory of types.&lt;ref name="Tiles"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tiles |first=Mary |authorlink=Mary Tiles |title=The philosophy of set theory an historical introduction to Cantor's paradise |year=2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-486-43520-6 |page=159 |url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486435202.html |edition=Dover |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Propositional Function, or a predicate, in a variable ''x'' is a sentence ''p''(''x'') involving ''x'' that becomes a proposition when we give ''x'' a definite value from the set of values it can take.

According to [[Clarence Lewis]], "A [[proposition]] is any expression which is either true or false; a propositional function is an expression, containing one or more variables, which becomes a proposition when each of the variables is replaced by some [[logical value|one of its values]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Lewis]] (1918) ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', page 232, [[University of California Press]], second edition 1932, Dover edition 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis used the notion of propositional functions to introduce [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, for example, a propositional function of ''n'' variables is a relation of [[arity]] ''n''. The case of ''n'' = 2 corresponds to [[binary relation]]s, of which there are homogeneous relations (both variables from the same set) and [[heterogeneous relation]]s.

The '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as ''I,'' the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the object that is known.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1891)&lt;/ref&gt;

Current views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C. &amp; Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.

The self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as [[self-awareness]], [[self-esteem]], [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and [[self-perception]]. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society. "Probably, the best account of the origins of selfhood is that the self comes into being at the interface between the inner biological processes of the human body and the sociocultural network to which the person belongs."&lt;ref name="The Self"&gt;Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. "The Self." Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57–96. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut's formulation==
{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}
Heinz Kohut&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut (1966), "Forms and Transformations of Narcissism" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97–123&lt;/ref&gt; initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press&lt;/ref&gt;), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.

Kohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic transference (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.

Kohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.

Kohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.

According to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978&lt;ref&gt;"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425&lt;/ref&gt; explain:

''"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)"''

Kohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient—to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).

==Winnicott's selves==
{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}
Donald Winnicott distinguished what he called the "true self" from the "false self" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about "being active", but not about "just growing, just breathing"':&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.

Nevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization – a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318&lt;/ref&gt;
Five levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.&lt;ref name="Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148"&gt;Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; 
# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.
# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.
# Even closer to health, we find the false self "... established on the basis of identifications".&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.&lt;ref name="Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148"/&gt;

As for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  "hide and seek"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berne's transactional analysis==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}
In his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;
* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.
* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.
* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The fewer people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.&lt;ref name="Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics"&gt;Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. "Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics." Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22. Web &lt;http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berne considered that 'the feeling of "Self" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.&lt;ref name="Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics"/&gt;

Transactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.&lt;ref name="Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics"/&gt; Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jungian archetype of the self ==
{{Main|Self (Jung)}}
In Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.&lt;ref name="Transpersonal Pioneers"&gt;Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.&lt;/ref&gt; The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.&lt;ref name="Transpersonal Pioneers"/&gt; It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.&lt;ref name="Man and his Symbols"/&gt; The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Transpersonal Pioneers"/&gt; The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.&lt;ref name="Man and his Symbols"&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

What distinguishes Jungian psychology from previous theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality—including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.&lt;ref name="Man and his Symbols"/&gt; People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: "If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc."&lt;ref name="Transpersonal Pioneers"/&gt;

The Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being. Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy| author=Thompson, E | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2017 | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/waking-dreaming-being/9780231137096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of the concept==
'Selfhood' or complete autonomy is a common Western approach to psychology and models of self are employed constantly in areas such as [[psychotherapy]] and [[self-help]]. [[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.

The very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].

&lt;!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[‘the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. --&gt;
It is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.

As for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to "make my living" by keeping his mother alive'.&lt;ref&gt;Minsky, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.&lt;ref name=Self&gt;Tapu, CS (2001). ''[http://relationtherapy.webs.com/Hypostatic_Personality/Hypostatic_Personality.htm Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.
"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on."&lt;ref name=Self /&gt;

==Memory and the self==

Memory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Martin A. "Memory and the Self." Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628. Elsevier. Web. &lt;http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

One view of the Self, following from [[John Locke]], sees it as a product of [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Conway MA, Pleydell-Pearce CW. (2000). The construction of autobiographical memories in the self-memory system. Psychol Rev. 107(2):261-88. {{PMID|10789197}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that transitory mental constructions within episodic memory form a self-memory system that grounds the goals of the working self,&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt; but research upon those with [[amnesia]] find they have a coherent sense of self based upon preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge,&lt;ref name="Rathbone"&gt;Rathbone CJ, Moulin CJ, Conway MA. (2009).  Autobiographical memory and amnesia: Using conceptual knowledge to ground the self. Neurocase. 21:1-14. {{PMID|19382038}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[semantic memory|semantic fact]]s, and so conceptual knowledge rather than episodic memory.&lt;ref name="Rathbone"/&gt;

Both episodic and semantic memory systems have been proposed to generate a sense of self-identity: personal episodic memory enables the phenomenological continuity of identity, while personal semantic memory generates the narrative continuity of identity.&lt;ref name="Addis"&gt;Addis DR, Tippett L J. (2008). The contributions of autobiographical memory to the content and continuity of identity. In F. Sani (Ed.), Self-Continuity: Individual and Collective Perspectives (pp. 71–84).
New York: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The nature of personal narratives depends on highly conceptual and ‘story-like' information about one's life, which resides at the general event level of autobiographical memory and is thus unlikely to rely on more event-specific
episodic systems."&lt;ref name="Addis"/&gt;

=== Implicit theories and self-concepts ===
A two-step process for recalling past states, proposed by Ross,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Michael|title=Relation of implicit theories to the construction of personal histories.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-295X.96.2.341|journal=Psychological Review|volume=96|issue=2|pages=341–357|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that:
# The current state of attribute or belief is assessed
# A theory of stability or change is invoked
# Steps 1 and 2 are combined to infer the earlier state of attribute or belief
This theory suggests that recollection of past states would be biased if a person's state has changed but they expect no change to have occurred, or if the state has remained constant when a change was expected.

For example, an implicit theory of stability is often invoked when assessing political allegiances, therefore if this allegiance actually changes, recollection of past allegiance will be incorrect, and assumed to be the same as the current political identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi|first=Richard G.|last2=Katz|first2=Richard S.|last3=Newman|first3=David|date=1980-01-01|title=Reconstructing Past Partisanship: The Failure of the Party Identification Recall Questions|jstor=2110951|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=24|issue=4|pages=633–651|doi=10.2307/2110951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An implicit theory of change is invoked when a change in an attribute over time is expected. One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738–748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738}}&lt;/ref&gt; which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.

=== Recalling Pain ===
In general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35–46|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3959(03)00003-4|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187–194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience. Whilst the length of the experience factors in very little, there is a 'duration neglect' when recollecting painful experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Fredrickson|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Schreiber|first3=Charles A.|last4=Redelmeier|first4=Donald A.|date=2016-05-06|title=WHEN MORE PAIN IS PREFERRED TO LESS:. Adding a Better End|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00589.x|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=401–405|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00589.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==

[[Symbolic interactionism]] stresses the 'social construction of an individual's sense of self' through two main methods: 'In part the self emerges through interaction with others....But the self is a product of [[social structure]] as well as of face-to-face interaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Fraser, "Social Psychology" in Richard Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 721-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social psychology]] acknowledges that 'one of the most important life tasks each of us faces is understanding both who we are and how we feel about ourselves'. However, rather than absolute knowledge, it would seem that 'a healthy sense of self calls for both accurate self-knowledge and protective self-enhancement, in just the right amounts at just the right times.'&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self as an emergent phenomena===

In [[dynamical social psychology]] as proposed by [[Andrzej Nowak (psychologist)|Nowak]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Nowak, A., Vallacher, R. R., Tesser, A. &amp; Borkowski, W. (2000). Society of self: The emergence of collective properties of self-Structure. Psychological Review, 107, 39-61.&lt;/ref&gt; the self is rather an emergent property that emerges as an experiential phenomena from the interaction of psychological perceptions and experience. This is also hinted in dynamical evolutionary social psychology by Douglas Kenrick et al.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"&gt;Kenrick, D. T., Li, N. P., &amp; Butner, J. (2003) "Dynamical evolutionary psychology: Individual decision rules and emergent social norms," Psychological Review 110: 3–28.&lt;/ref&gt; where a set of decision rules generates complex behaviour.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;

==Parts of the self==
{{main|Self-concept}}
[[File:The Self.jpg|thumb|One's [[self-perception]] is defined by one's [[self-concept]], [[self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], [[self-esteem]], and [[social self]].]]

The self is an automatic part of every human being, in which enables people to relate to others. The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

===Self-knowledge===
{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}
Self-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

The '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

The '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

Self-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.&lt;ref name= "McLeod"&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html&lt;/ref&gt; People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.&lt;ref name="McLeod"/&gt; In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt; It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt; People with low self-esteem typically:

:*do not wish to fail
:*are less confident in their success rate
:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)
:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]
:*are more prone to emotional imbalances&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;
:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people
:*worry what others think about them consistently
:*have more pessimistic thinking
:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people&lt;ref name="McLeod"/&gt;

:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

:*overestimating their own good qualities
:*their control over happenings in their life
:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

===Interpersonal self===
Interpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

Social roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the "expected" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.&lt;ref name="Social Roles and Social Norms"&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Social norms constitute the "unwritten rules" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.&lt;ref name="Social Roles and Social Norms"/&gt;

===Agent self===
The agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.&lt;ref name="The Self"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Pudgala''' (or ''{{IAST|Pudgalāstikāya}}'') is one of the six [[Dravya (Jainism)|Dravya]]s, or aspects of reality that fabricate the world we live in. The six ''dravya''s include the [[jiva]] and the fivefold divisions of [[ajiva]] (non-living) category: ''dharma'' (motion), ''adharma'' (rest), ''akasha'' (space), ''pudgala'' (matter) and ''kala'' (time).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Chandradhar (1960, reprint 1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pudgala'', like other ''dravya''s except ''kala'' is called ''astikaya'' in the sense that it occupies space. 

Pudgala is derived from the words 'pud', which is defined as Supplement (Addition /Fusion), and gala, which is defined as Disintegrate, or Division or Fission. Therefore, Pudgalas are best defined as all things that are continuously changing by the process of Supplementation or Disintegration, namely matter.

The individual unit of Pudgala is the material from which all is made called a [[Paramanu]], which, by the process of supplementation, can combine to form what can be roughly said is an aggregate, called a [[Skandha (Jainism)|Skandha]]. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}}

In [[Buddhism]], ''Pudgala'' means the entity that reincarnates as an individual or person, i.e., the ''bundle of tendencies'' that keeps an individual reincarnating until they attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975, reprint 2010). ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Vol.I, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0412-8}}, p.195n&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sea of Beauty''' is one of many analogies and similes employed to describe a high vision of reality. Some writers have employed this term upon having arrived at the  most mature, the farthest, and the highest stages of the philosophical or mystical search. It is described variously as the [[Beatific Vision]],  [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],  [[nirvana]], [[satori]], [[Kensho]], [[Bodhi]], awareness, true knowledge, etc.

Those who claim to have had such a high and final vision sometimes report that reality is, at its deepest level, utterly unified, like a vast ocean, and that it is unutterably beautiful, or rather, source of all beauty. Such likenesses are drawn many places, including the mystical poetry of Sufi Jalal'udin Rumi and the writings of Plato.

[[Rumi]], in this unidentified excerpt, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The shop of Oneness,&lt;br&gt;
The Ocean that has many harbours,&lt;br&gt;
Yet where there is no division&lt;br&gt;
Between man and man, or woman,&lt;br&gt;
But only a unity of souls&lt;br&gt;
In the process of return to their Creator,&lt;br&gt;
Whose breath lives inside each one&lt;br&gt;
And helps to guide us home."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato, in his [[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's Symposium]] (210d–e) writes (in the character of the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The result is that he will see the beauty of knowledge... the lover is turned to the great sea of beauty, and gazing upon this, he gives birth to many gloriously beautiful ideas and theories, in unstinting love of wisdom, until, having grown and been strengthened there, he catches sight of such knowledge, and it is the knowledge of such beauty... The man ... who has beheld beautiful things in the right order and correctly, is now coming to the goal of Loving: all of a sudden he will catch sight of something wonderfully beautiful in its nature; that, Socrates, is the reason for all his earlier labors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Second modernity''' is a phrase coined by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ulrich Beck]], and is his word for the period after [[modernity]].

Where modernity broke down [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] in favour of [[industrial society]], second modernity transforms industrial society into a new and more reflexive [[network society]] or information society {{harv|He|2012|loc=111 and 215}}.

==Risk society==
{{Main|Risk society}}
Second modernity is marked by a new awareness of the risks — risks to all forms of life, plant, animal and human — created by the very successes of modernity in tackling the problem of human scarcity {{harv|Carrier and Nordmann|2011|loc=449}}. Systems that previously seemed to offer protection from risks both natural and social are increasingly recognised as producing new man-made risks on a global scale as a byproduct of their functioning {{harv|He|2012|loc=147}}. Such systems become part of the problem, not the solution. Modernisation and information advances themselves create new social dangers, such as [[cybercrime]] (He 2012, 69), while scientific advances open up new areas, like [[cloning]] or [[genetic modification]], where decisions are necessarily made without adequate capacity to assess longterm consequences {{harv|Allan, Adam, and Carter|1999|loc=xii–ii}}.

Recognising the fresh dilemmas created by this [[reflexive modernization]], Beck has suggested a new "cosmopolitan Realpolitik" to overcome the difficulties of a world in which national interests can no longer be promoted effectively at the national level alone {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=173}}.

==Knowledge society==
Second modernity has also been linked to the so-called [[Society#Knowledge|knowledge society]], marked by a pluralisation of different types of knowledge {{harv|Carrier|n.d.|loc=439 and 448}}. It is characterised in particular by knowledge-dependent risks — the uncertainties manufactured by the information world itself {{harv|Harding|2008|loc=55–58}}.

==Resistance==

Various forms of resistance to second modernity have emerged, among them for example [[Euroscepticism]] {{harv|Marchetti and Vidović|2010|loc=171}}.

Beck himself sees [[al-Qaeda]] as a by-product of, as well as resistance to, second modernity, not only in its use of information technology tools, but also in its syncretist ideology {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=113}}.

'''Self-verification''' is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] theory that asserts people want to be known and understood by others according to their firmly held beliefs and feelings about themselves, that is ''self-views'' (including [[self-concept]]s and [[self-esteem]]). A competing theory to self-verification is ''[[self-enhancement]]'' or the drive for positive evaluations.

Because chronic self-concepts and self-esteem play an important role in understanding the world, providing a sense of coherence, and guiding action, people become motivated to maintain them through self-verification. Such strivings provide stability to people’s lives, making their experiences more coherent, orderly, and comprehensible than they would be otherwise. Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and the larger society, in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Swann | Milton | Polzer | 2000 | pp=79, 238–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, people engage in a variety of activities that are designed to obtain self-verifying information.

Developed by [[William Swann]] (1981), the theory grew out of earlier writings which held that people form self-views so that they can understand and predict the responses of others and know how to act toward them.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between positive and negative self-views==
There are individual differences in people's views of themselves. Among people with ''positive self-views'', the desire for self-verification works together with another important motive, the desire for positive evaluations or "[[self enhancement]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; For example, those who view themselves as "insightful" will find that their motives for both self-verification and self-enhancement encourage them to seek evidence that other people recognize their insightfulness.

In contrast, people with ''negative self-views'' will find that the desire for self-verification and self-enhancement are competing. Consider people who see themselves as disorganized. Whereas their desire for self-enhancement will compel them to seek evidence that others perceive them as organized, their desire for self-verification will compel such individuals to seek evidence that others perceive them as disorganized. Self-verification strivings tend to prevail over self-enhancement strivings when people are certain of the self-concept&lt;ref&gt;Pelham &amp; Swann, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and when they have extremely depressive self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, Josephs, &amp; Swann, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification strivings may have undesirable consequences for people with negative self-views ([[Clinical depression|depressed]] people and those who suffer from low [[self-esteem]]). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to [[interpersonal attraction|gravitate]] toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of [[self-worth]], or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek [[Family therapy|therapy]], returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Predmore, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: [[workplace bullying]]).&lt;ref&gt;Weisenfeld, Swann, Brockner, &amp; Bartel, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings and related ones point to the importance of efforts to improve the self-views of those who suffer from low self-esteem and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Chang-Schneider &amp; McClarty, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on behavior==
In one series of studies, researchers asked participants with positive and negative self-views whether they would prefer to interact with evaluators who had favorable or unfavorable impressions of them. The results showed that those with positive self-views preferred favorable partners and those with negative self-views preferred unfavorable partners. The latter finding revealed that self-verification strivings may sometimes trump positivity strivings.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1992; Swann, Stein-Seroussi, Giesler, 1992; see Swann, Chang-Schneider, &amp; Angulo, in press, for a review&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification motives operate for different dimensions of the self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, and it does not matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively ''immutable'' (e.g., intelligence) or ''changeable'' (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be ''highly specific'' (e.g., athletic) or ''global'' (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when the alternative is participating in a different experiment.&lt;ref name="SwannWenzlaff"&gt;Swann, Wenzlaff, &amp; Tafarodi, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships.&lt;ref&gt;Lemay &amp; Ashmore, 2004; Chen, Chen, &amp; Shaw, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities associated with being a woman.

Self-verification theory suggests that people may begin to shape others' evaluations of them before they even begin interacting with them. They may, for example, display identity cues (see: [[impression management]]). The most effective identity cues enable people to signal who they are to potential interaction partners.

* Physical appearance, such as clothes, body posture, demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the low self-esteem person who evokes reactions that confirm her negative self-views by slumping her shoulders and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground.
* Other cues, such as the car someone buys, the house they live in, the way they decorate their living environment. For example, an [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] evokes reactions that confirm a person's positive self-view.

Self-verification strivings may also influence the social contexts that people enter into and remain in. People reject those who provide social feedback that does not confirm their self-views, such as married people with negative self-views who reject spouses who see them positively and vice versa. College roommates behave in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Pelham, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Swann, DeLaRonde, &amp; Hixon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; People are more inclined to [[divorce]] partners who perceived them too favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Cast &amp; Burke, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these instances, people gravitated toward relationships that provided them with evaluations that confirmed their self-views and fled from those that did not.

When people fail to gain self-verifying reactions through the display of identity cue or through choosing self-verifying social environments, they may still acquire such evaluations by systematically evoking confirming reactions. For example, depressed people behave in negative ways toward their roommates, thus causing these roommates to reject them.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, &amp; Pelham, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification theory predicts that when people interact with others, there is a general tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves. This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;Swann &amp; Read, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Brockner, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of confirmation bias==
{{Main|Confirmation bias}}
Self-verification theory predicts that people’s self-views will cause them to see the world as more supportive of these self-views than it really is. That is, individuals process information in a [[bias]]ed manner. These biases may be conscious and deliberate, but are probably more commonly done effortlessly and non-consciously. Through the creative use of these processes, people may dramatically increase their chances of attaining self-verification. There are at least three relevant aspects of information processing in self-verification:

#[[Attention]]: People will attend to evaluations that are self-confirming while ignoring non-confirming evaluations.&lt;ref name="Swann" /&gt;
#[[Recollection|Memory retrieval]]: self-views bias memory recall to favor self-confirming material over non-confirming elements.&lt;ref&gt;Story, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
#Interpretation of information:  people tend to interpret information in ways that reinforce their self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Shrauger &amp; Lund, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

These distinct forms of self-verification may often be implemented sequentially. For example, in one scenario, people may first strive to locate partners who verify one or more self-views. If this fails, they may redouble their efforts to elicit verification for the self-view in question or strive to elicit verification for a different self-view. Failing this, they may strive to "see" more self-verification than actually exists. And, if this strategy is also ineffective, they may withdraw from the relationship, either psychologically or in actuality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Related processes==

===Preference for novelty===
People seem to prefer modest levels of novelty; they want to experience phenomena that are unfamiliar enough to be interesting, but not so unfamiliar as to be frightening or too familiar as to be boring.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Berlyne, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of people's preference for novelty for [[interpersonal relationship|human relationships]] are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily from studies of people's reactions to [[art object]]s and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects are very different from people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's [[belief|belief systems]]. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., [[leisure|leisure activities]]), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Tension with self-enhancement===
People's self-verification strivings are apt to be most influential when the relevant [[identity (social science)|identities]] and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, and the behavior itself should be consequential. When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.&lt;ref&gt;Kwang &amp; Swann, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

But if people with firmly held negative self-views seek self-verification, this does not mean that they are masochistic or have no desire to be loved. In fact, even people with very low self-esteem want to be loved.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} What sets people with negative self-views apart is their ambivalence about the evaluations they receive. Just as positive evaluations foster joy and warmth initially, these feelings are later chilled by incredulity. And although negative evaluations may foster sadness that the "truth" could not be kinder, it will at least reassure them that they know themselves. Happily, people with negative self-views are the exception rather than the rule. That is, on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively. Although this imbalance is adaptive for society at large, it poses a challenge to researchers interested in studying self-verification. That is, for theorists interested in determining if behavior is driven by self-verification or positivity strivings, participants with positive self-views will reveal nothing because both motives compel them to seek positive evaluations. If researchers want to learn if people prefer verification or positivity in a giving setting, they must study people with negative self-views.&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see Swann et al., in press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-concept change===
Although self-verification strivings tend to stabilize people's self-views, changes in self-views may still occur. Probably the most common source of change is set in motion when the [[social environment]] recognizes a significant change in a person's age (e.g., when adolescents become adults), [[social status|status]] (e.g., when students become teachers), or [[social role]] (e.g., when someone is convicted of a crime). Suddenly, the community may change the way that it treats the person.  Eventually the target of such treatment will bring his or her self-view into accord with the new treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D (July 10–11, 2010). The Age of Contentment. The Weekend Australian Magazine p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, people may themselves conclude that a given self-view is dysfunctional or obsolete and take steps to change it. Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In the hands of a skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer her toward more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with a partner who is certain that she deserves to view herself more positively, that woman will tend to improve the self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Swann &amp; Ely, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have argued that self-verification processes are relatively rare, manifesting themselves only among people with terribly negative self views. In support of this viewpoint, critics cite hundreds of studies indicating that people prefer, seek and value positive evaluations more than negative ones. Such skeptical assessments overlook three important points. First, because most people have relatively positive self-views,&lt;ref&gt;Swann, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of a preference for positive evaluations in unselected samples may in reality reflect a preference for evaluations that are self-verifying, because for such individuals self-verification and positivity strivings are indistinguishable. No number of studies of participants with positive self-views can determine whether self-verification or self-enhancement strivings are more common. Second, self-verification strivings are not limited to people with globally negative self-views; even people with high self-esteem seek negative evaluations about their flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Pelham &amp; Krull, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, even people with positive self-views appear to be uncomfortable with overly positive evaluations. For example, people with moderately positive self-views withdraw from spouses who evaluate them in an exceptionally positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, De La Ronde, &amp; Hixon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have suggested that when people with negative self-views seek unfavorable evaluations, they do so as a means of avoiding truly negative evaluations or for purposes of self-improvement, with the idea being that this will enable them to obtain positive evaluations down the road. Tests of this idea have failed to support it. For example, just as people with negative self-views choose self-verifying, negative evaluators even when the alternative is being in another experiment, they choose to be in another experiment rather than interact with someone who evaluates them positively.&lt;ref name="SwannWenzlaff" /&gt; Also, people with negative self-views are most intimate with spouses who evaluate them negatively, despite the fact that these spouses are relatively unlikely to enable them to improve themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Swann et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in a study of people's thought processes as they chose interaction partners,&lt;ref&gt;Swann, et al., 1992&lt;/ref&gt; people with negative self-views indicated that they chose negative evaluators because such partners seemed likely to confirm their self-views (an epistemic consideration) and interact smoothly with them (a pragmatic consideration); self-improvement was rarely mentioned.

'''Serkan Özkaya''' (1973) is a [[Turkish Americans|Turkish-American]] [[Conceptual art|conceptual artist]] whose work deals with topics of [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] and reproduction. He typically operates outside of traditional art spaces and often makes multiple versions of even his own work including his most noted work [[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]]. Özkaya's artworks are held in the permanent collections of the [[İstanbul Modern]] and [[Perili Köşk|Borusan Contemporary Art]] in [[Istanbul]], as well as three different [[21c Museum Hotels]] locations—[[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]; and [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

== Early life and education ==
Özkaya grew up in [[Istanbul|Istanbul, Turkey]]. At a young age, he began learning about [[Art of Europe|Western art]] through the study of reproductions of major artworks found in books. It is here his interests in the concepts originality, replication and emulation began.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic|title=Review: Serkan Ozkaya works magic|last=Cooper|first=Ivy|date=2008-10-07|website=STL Beacon|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150411222101/https://www.stlbeacon.org/%23!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic#!/content/13301/review_serkan_ozkaya_works_magic|archive-date=2015-04-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Istanbul University]], graduating with both a bachelor and a master's degree in arts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.art21.org/2011/07/01/inside-the-artists-studio-serkan-ozkaya/|title=Inside the Artist's Studio {{!}} Serkan Özkaya|last=Kotretsos|first=Georgia|date=2011-07-01|website=Art21 Magazine|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his graduate studies at [[Bard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/04/another-handdrawn-newspaper.html|title=Serkan Ozkaya, Dave Muller and the hand-drawn newspaper|last=Knight|first=Christopher|date=2009-04-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After leaving Bard with a master's degree in fine art,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; he received an art fellowship at [[MacDowell Colony]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Özkaya then returned to Istanbul University to study for his Ph.D. in German Language and Literature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2001, he published ''Genius and Creativity in the Arts'', a comparative study of the German works [[Moses und Aron]] (an opera by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]), [[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]] (a novel by [[Thomas Mann]]) and [[:de:Die Philosophie der Neuen Musik|Die Philosophie der Neuen Musik]] (a book by [[Theodor W. Adorno]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Notable works in serial form ===
''Dear Sir or Madam'' (1996–2009) is a collection of letters and other correspondences between Özkaya and cultural institutions, dignitaries and curators. It is his own paper trail of bureaucracy in inaction. In the collection, among others, are his letters to the Louvre asking that he be allowed to hang the [[Mona Lisa]] upside down&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/15/arts/design/15serk.html|title=Serkan Ozkaya - Art - Report|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2006-12-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter to the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]] that they permit him to re-[[Christo and Jeanne-Claude#Wrapped Reichstag|wrap the Reichstag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/zeitgenoessische-kunst-aus-istanbul-im-haus-der-kulturen-der-welt-gewitzte-metaphern-16772842|title=Zeitgenössische Kunst aus Istanbul im Haus der Kulturen der Welt: Gewitzte Metaphern|last=Böker|first=Carmen|work=Berliner Zeitung|access-date=2017-09-08|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the letters do not deserve a response but curiously, they have usually been treated with official but unthinking courtesy, read perhaps but not comprehended—answered and then often passed along the bureaucratic chain. In 2009, ''Dear Sir or Madam'' was exhibited at the Slag Gallery in New York along with works from the same period. Among them was ''Proletarier Aller Laender'' (1998-2009) or ''Proletariat of all Countries'', as it is also known in English, a collection of red plastic foam figurines glued to the floor. In viewing this work, the audience is most likely forced to trample on the little figures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as if to trample on the working classes. However, the [[proletariat]], which the figurines represent, in their resilience and ultimate power always springing back, indestructible.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other works in the exhibition included the golden sculptures ''Levitation by Defecation'' (2008), ''Shit on a Stick'' (2008), and ''Goldenboy'' (2006), "a fiberglass figure painted in gold acrylic and dangling a couple of feet off the ground by a noose".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2000, Özkaya collected roughly 30,000 slides from artists, galleries, and institutions and showed them on one of the largest galleries in the main pedestrian street in Istanbul, at the Kazim Taskent Art Gallery. ''What A Museum Should Really Look Like (Large Glass)'' presented a giant mosaic of individual images. During the day the slides were readable from the inside of the gallery and at night, with the lights on, they became a scene for the street. This piece was later initiated in [[Utrecht|Utrecht, the Netherlands]] in a much larger scale with 100,000 slides.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The collage of thousands of pieces of artwork was collected through an online advertisement. All of the works were arranged in the mosaic with no coherent order and no editorial or curatorial control from Özkaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/18/arts/art-review-politics-that-makes-peace-with-the-beauty-of-objects.html|title=ART REVIEW; Politics That Makes Peace With the Beauty of Objects|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2004-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Özkaya turned the front and back covers of the [[Turkish language]] newspaper, ''[[Radikal]]'' into drawings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This act enabled the reader to acquire a limited edition artwork for the price of the newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In early 2004, it was part of a group exhibition named "The Poetics of Proximity" at the Guggenheim Gallery at [[Chapman University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/arts/strange-land-6381040|title=Strange Land|last=Schoenkopf|first=Rebecca|date=2004-02-19|work=OC Weekly|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, in subsequent years, some pages of several other newspapers were also hand-rendered and appeared as a print of the drawings. The overall piece, entitled ''Today Could Be A Day Of Historical Importance'' was executed in Sweden with ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', in Germany with Freitag,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/kopierer-aller-lander|title=Kopierer aller Länder...|last=Arend|first=Ingo|date=2005-08-07|website=der Freitag|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US with ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Courier-Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2009/04/10/kentucky-page-1a-turned-into-piece-of-newspaper-art/|title=Kentucky Page 1A turned into piece of newspaper art|last=Associated Press|first=|date=2009-04-10|website=The Denver Post|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of which was created in collaboration with the non-profit artwithoutwalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/10/louisvilles-emcourier-jou_n_185558.html|title=Louisville's Courier-Journal Front Page Completely Drawn By Artist|last=Shea|first=Danny|date=2009-05-11|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' version in the "Weekend Arts" section appeared ''[[mise en abyme]]'' with Özkaya's drawing appearing as an inset in the page and an even smaller drawing appearing as an inset of that, and so on, creating a [[Droste effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/magazine/serk.pdf|title=Weekend Arts: Fine Arts, Leisure|last=|first=|date=2006-12-15|website=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Louisville, high class (7963849776).jpg|thumb|[[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]] in front of [[21c Museum Hotels|21c Museum Hotel]]]]
In 2005, Özkaya created ''[[David (inspired by Michelangelo)]]'', a double-sized golden replica of [[Michelangelo]]ʼs [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] based on a 3D computer model by [[Marc Levoy]] of [[Stanford University]]. The sculpture was first intended to be part of the [[Istanbul Biennial#Participating artists at the 2005 Istanbul Biennial|9th International Istanbul Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://9b.iksv.org/english/?Page=Artists&amp;Sub=Az&amp;Content=Serkan_Ozkaya|title=Serkan Özkaya|last=|first=|date=September 2005|website=9th International İstanbul Biennial|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the statue crashed and was destroyed while in the process of being installed at [[Şişli|Şişli Square]]. Özkaya created two new versions of the replica at a studio in [[Eskişehir]], one of which was to be placed in the local Sazova Science, Art and Culture Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=davut-sculpture-goes-to-kentucky-21c-museum-2011-09-19|title=Davut sculpture goes to Kentucky 21C Museum|last=Bozkurt|first=Göksel|date=2011-09-19|work=Hurriyet Daily News|access-date=2017-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603192504/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=davut-sculpture-goes-to-kentucky-21c-museum-2011-09-19|archive-date=2015-06-03|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was acquired by [[21c Museum Hotels]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whas11.com/community/Giant-gold-replica-of-David-arrives-in-Louisville-149911335.html|title=Louisville residents react to giant, gold David statue|last=Ruper|first=Maggie|date=2012-05-02|work=WHAS11|access-date=2017-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310103955/http://www.whas11.com/community/Giant-gold-replica-of-David-arrives-in-Louisville-149911335.html|archive-date=2013-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its way to Louisville, the piece made a stop in [[New York City]].

In ''A Sudden Gust of Wind'' (2007 –2013), Özkaya depicted the journey of a stack of papers blown away by the wind. The original work was made with basic materials: [[ISO 216#A series|standard A4 paper]], thread, and glue. The piece was inspired by ''Ejiri in Suruga Province (A Sudden Gust of Wind)'', a 19th-century Japanese woodcut by [[Hokusai]], and ''A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai)'' (1993) by [[Jeff Wall]]. One version of the installation was first exhibited at the Boots Contemporary Art Space in St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another version of the work was acquired by 21c Museum Hotel and installed at their third location in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]].

''Bring me the head of…'' (2007–2015) is the edible form of a teddy bear's head on a plate. Instead of working with museums or galleries, in this series, Özkaya collaborated with restaurants and chefs and they decided the ingredients—that is the material of the sculpture. This work was made in collaboration with [[M on the Bund]] in [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://v3.arkitera.com/arsgratiaartis.php?action=displayNewsItem&amp;ID=20470|title=Serkan Özkaya yeni heykeli ile Şanghay'da|last=|first=|date=2007-09-24|website=Arkitera.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered at Freemans' Restaurant in New York in 2007 as a part of the [[Performa (performance festival)|Performa Biennial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p-e-r-f-o-r-m-a-n-c-e.org/?p=2578|title=With every bite, a bit of history|last=Goldberg|first=Roselee|date=2016|website=p-e-r-f-o-r-m-a-n-c-e|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zine.artcat.com/2007/11/bring-me-the-head-of-serkan-ozkaya.php|title=Bring Me the Head of Serkan Özkaya|last=Vartanian|first=Hrag|date=2007-11-28|website=Artcat|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Changa in Istanbul in 2008, as street food in [[İzmir|Izmir]] in 2009,{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} at Capital M in [[Beijing]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2012/05/25/art-attack-oklahoma-moves-bookstore-opens-exhibits-close-and-wanda-buys-amc|title=Art Attack: Oklahoma!

In ''One and Three Pasta'' (2012), Özkaya collaborated with the architect George L.

''An Attempt at Exhausting A Place…'' is a series of works in which the artist "dissolves the white cube" and the usual constraints of a traditional art space. Four projectors are used to display a live feed of the scene beyond the wall on which they are projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/serkan-c3zkaya-dissolves-white-cube-512771|title=Serkan Özkaya Dissolves the White Cube {{!}} artnet News|last=Gopnik|first=Blake|date=2016-06-07|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was exhibited as part of Özkaya's solo exhibition at the [[Postmasters Gallery]] in New York,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/05/weekend-edition-10-things-to-do-in-new-yorks-art-world-before-may-16/|title=Weekend Edition: 10 Things to Do in New York's Art World Before May 16|last=Laster|first=Paul|date=2016-05-12|work=Observer|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; running from May 14 to June 18, 2016.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In a similar installation at [[İstanbul Modern]], a projection on one its interior walls treated the view to a scene of the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Strait]], making the wall seem transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2017/02/10/istanbul-moderns-harbor-exhibition-focuses-on-citys-kinship-with-sea|title=Istanbul Modern's 'HARBOR' exhibition focuses on city's kinship with sea|last=|first=|date=2017-02-09|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the work is also presented in a permanent exhibition at the lobby of the 21c Museum Hotel in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://artfcity.com/2017/06/19/a-museum-chain-is-local-and-also-a-hotel/|title=A Museum Chain is Local, and Also a Hotel|last=Johnson|first=Paddy|date=2017-06-19|work=Art F City|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/life/arts/2017/07/09/21-c-museum-hotel-nashvilles-inaugural-exhibition-seeks-the-truth/455371001/|title=21c Museum Hotel Nashville's inaugural exhibition seeks 'the truth'|last=Baker|first=Milinda|date=2017-07-09|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable works ===
''Atlas'' (2011) is a contribution to a walking museum wherein Özkaya constructed a rock to be strapped to the curator's back and promenaded daily throughout the streets of New York. The idea was to make "the museum" itself wander around the streets of the city with Özkaya's new piece, a giant rock.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Radisson/Picasso'' (2012), a pair of [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] matchboxes with the text of one of which has been changed to read "Picasso" instead of "Radisson" and was displayed alongside the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/friday-photo-radissonpicasso/|title=Friday Photo: Radisson/Picasso|last=Murg|first=Stephanie|date=2012-03-23|work=AdWeek|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mirage'' (2013) was installed at the Postmasters Gallery in New York and consisted of a shadow of a passenger airplane that crossed the room for 45 seconds every four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/76818/a-shadowy-plane-in-the-cave/|title=A Shadowy Plane in the Cave|last=Vartanian|first=Hrag|date=2013-07-31|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow here was considered not as the mere absence of light but rather as a material in and of itself which could then be sculpted. The work was also exhibited as part of the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection's Overture: New Acquisitions (2015) at [[Perili Köşk]] in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2014/12/03/two-new-exhibitions-open-at-borusan-contemporary|title=Two new exhibitions open at Borusan Contemporary|last=|first=|date=2014-12-03|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''MyMoon'' (2015 – present) is another artwork by Özkaya, a large round rock floating in the sky, that is visible only through a [[smartphone]] via the MyMoon app. Using the phone's GPS and compass, MyMoon app detects the object in the sky and makes it visible. MyMoon rotates in close proximity to the earth's moon in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bonemagazine.com/en/entry/istanbul-comics-art-festival|title=Istanbul Comics &amp; Art Festival|last=Yıldız|first=Itır|date=|website=Bone Magazine|access-date=2017-09-08}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet unlike the earth's satellite, it is visible outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyg84n/if-apple-cares-so-much-about-design-why-does-the-app-store-ignore-artists|title=If Apple Cares So Much About Design, Why Does the App Store Ignore Artists?|last=Pangburn|first=DJ|date=2015-11-13|website=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/why-the-apple-app-store-needs-an-art-category/|title=Why the Apple App Store Needs an Art Category|last=Miller|first=Sean|date=2015-11-16|work=PopMatters|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Özkaya presented his latest major work ''En attendons'' (''We Will Wait'') at the Postmasters Gallery. The work is a recreation of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Étant donnés]]'' from which Özkaya's also gets its name in [[anagram]] form.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/arts/design/now-you-see-him-now-you-dont-duchamp-from-beyond-the-grave.html|title=Now You See Him, Now You Don’t: Duchamp From Beyond the Grave|last=Mewshaw|first=Marc|date=2017-09-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özkaya claims to have discovered a secret hidden within Duchamp's piece.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/duchamp-etant-donnes-secret-serkan-ozkaya-1103216|title=Has Duchamp’s Final Work Harbored a Secret for Five Decades?|last=Boucher|first=Brian|date=2017-10-03|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that it is not only a [[peephole]] into a [[diorama]] but that, under proper lighting, it also functions as a [[camera obscura]] that projects the French artist's self-portrait on a surface opposite the peephole.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; According to Özkaya, there is more to ''Étant Donnés'' than previously thought; that the work, which took Duchamp more than 20 years to create,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/privy-to-the-secrets-of-marcel-duchamp/article37436946/|title=A century later, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain continues to beguile the art world|last=Smith|first=Russell|date=December 27, 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; projects an image of Rrose Sélavy, "Duchamp’s female alter ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/10/18/duchamps-last-riddle/|title=Duchamp’s Last Riddle|last=Steinhauer|first=Jillian|date=2017-10-18|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{emotion}}
'''Sorrow''' is an [[emotion]], feeling, or sentiment. Sorrow "is more 'intense' than [[sadness]]... it implies a long-term state".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, ''Emotions across Languages and Cultures'' (1999) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time "sorrow — but not unhappiness — suggests a degree of resignation... which lends sorrow its peculiar air of dignity".&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka, p. 66"&gt;Wierzbicka, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, "in terms of attitude, sorrow can be said to be half way between ''sadness'' (accepting) and ''distress'' (not accepting)".&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka, p. 66"/&gt;

==Cult==
[[Romanticism]] saw a cult of sorrow develop, reaching back to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' of 1774, and extending through the nineteenth century with contributions like [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.|In Memoriam]]" — "O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me/No casual mistress, but a wife"&lt;ref&gt;''In Memoriam'' (London 1851) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; — up to [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1889, still "of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be that "the [[Romantic hero]]'s cult of sorrow is largely a matter of pretence",&lt;ref&gt;Lilian R. Furst, ''Romanticism in Perspective'' (1979) p. 102-3&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Jane Austen]] pointed out satirically through [[Marianne Dashwood]], "brooding over her sorrows... this excess of suffering"&lt;ref&gt;Jane Austen, ''Sense and Sensibility'' (London 1932) p. 183 and p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; may nevertheless have serious consequences.

Partly in reaction, the 20th century has by contrast been pervaded by the belief that "''acting'' sorrowful can actually make me sorrowful, as William James long ago observed".&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, ''Deeper than Reason'' (2005) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly "in the modern Anglo-emotional culture, characterized by the 'dampening of the emotions' in general... sorrow has largely given way to the milder, less painful, and more transient sadness".&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicka, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; A latter-day Werther is likely to be greeted by the call to '"Come off it, Gordon. We all know there is no sorrow like unto your sorrow"';&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Last Things'' (Penguin 1974) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; while any conventional 'valeoftearishness and deathwhereisthystingishness' would be met by the participants 'looking behind the sombre backs of one another's cards and discovering their {{Sic|?|hide=y|brightly|-}}colored faces'.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Grass, ''The Meeting at Telgte'' (London 1981) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps only the occasional subculture like the [[Jung]]ian would still seek to 'call up from the busy adult man the sorrow of animal life, the grief of all nature, "the tears of things"'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modernity]] has (if anything) only intensified the shift: 'the postmodern is closer to the human comedy than to the abyssal discontent...the abyss of sorrow'.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Black Sun'' (New York 1989) p. 258-9 and p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postponement==
'Not feeling sorrow invites fear into our lives. The longer we put off feeling sorrow, the greater our fear of it becomes. [[Postponement of affect|Postponing]] the expression of the feeling causes its energy to grow'.&lt;ref&gt;Erika M. Hunter, ''Little Book of Big Emotions'' (London 2004) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it would seem that 'grief in general is a "taming" of the primitive violent discharge affect, characterized by fear and self-destruction, to be seen in mourning'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 19460 p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Kristeva]] suggests that 'taming sorrow, not fleeing sadness at once but allowing it to settle for a while...is what one of the temporary and yet indispensable phases of [[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] might be'.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 84-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shand and McDougall==
Sadness is one of four interconnected ''sentiments'' in the system of [[Alexander Faulkner Shand]], the others being fear, anger, and joy.  In this system, when an impulsive tendency towards some important object is frustrated, the resultant sentiment is sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=73|chapter=Sentiments, Character, Free Will|title=Ethical Problems|author=Beatrice Edgell|location=London|publisher=Methuen &amp;amp; Co. Ltd|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shand's view, the emotion of sorrow, which he classifies as a primary emotion, has two ''impulses'': to cling to the object of sorrow, and to repair the injuries done to that object that caused the emotion in the first place.  Thus the primary emotion of sorrow is the basis for the emotion of pity, which Shand describes as a fusion of sorrow and joy: sorrow at the injury done to the object of pity, and joy as an "element of sweetness" tinging that sorrow.&lt;ref name=McDougall&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction To Social Psychology|author=[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp;amp; Distributors|date=1994|isbn=9788171564965|pages=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] disagreed with Shand's view, observing that Shand himself recognized that sorrow was itself derived from simpler elements. To support this argument, he observes that [[grief]], at a loss, is a form of sorrow where there is no impulse to repair injury, and that therefore there are identifiable subcomponents of sorrow. He also observes that although there is an element of emotional pain in sorrow, there is no such element in pity, thus pity is not a compound made from sorrow as a simpler component.&lt;ref name=McDougall /&gt;

A '''space sunshade''' or '''sunshield''' is a [[Umbrella|parasol]] that [[wikt:divert|divert]]s or otherwise reduces some of a star's radiation, preventing them from hitting a spacecraft or planet and thereby reducing its [[insolation]], which results in reduced heating.  Light can be diverted by different methods.  First proposed in 1989, the original space sunshade concept involves putting a large occulting disc, or technology of equivalent purpose at the L1 gravitation point ([[Lagrangian point]]) between the Earth and Sun.  

A sunshade is of particular interest as a [[climate engineering]] method for [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating]] [[global warming]] through [[solar radiation management]].  Heightened interest in such projects reflects the concern that internationally negotiated reductions in carbon emissions may be insufficient to stem climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, John. "The Political Economy of a Planetary Sunshade" Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics and Policy (2018): 16(1):1-10.  Retrieved 3-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sunshades could also be used to produce [[space solar power]], acting as [[solar power satellites]]. Proposed shade designs include a single-piece shade and a shade made by a great number of small objects. Most such proposals contemplate a blocking element at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]].

In 1989 James Early proposed a space-based sun-shade to divert sunlight at the planetary level.  His design involved making a large glass (2000 km) occulter from lunar material and placing at the L1 point.  Issues included the large amount of material needed to make the disc and also the energy to launch it to its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming|title=How a giant space umbrella could stop global warming|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs for planetary sunshade==

=== Cloud of small spacecraft ===
One proposed sunshade would be composed of 16&amp;nbsp;trillion small disks at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]], 1.5 million kilometers above Earth. Each disk is proposed to have a 0.6-meter diameter and a thickness of about 5&amp;nbsp;micrometers. The mass of each disk would be about a gram, adding up to a total of almost 20&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The individual autonomous flyers building up the cloud of sunshades are proposed not to reflect the sunlight but rather to be transparent lenses, deflecting the light slightly so it does not hit Earth.  This minimizes the effect of [[solar radiation pressure]] on the units, requiring less effort to hold them in place at the L1 point.  An optical prototype has been constructed by [[Roger Angel]] with funding from [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The remaining solar pressure and the fact that the L1 point is one of [[unstable equilibrium]], easily disturbed by the wobble of the earth due to gravitational effects from the moon, requires the small autonomous flyers to be capable of maneuvering themselves to hold position.  A suggested solution is to place mirrors capable of rotation on the surface of the flyers.  By using the solar radiation pressure on the mirrors as [[solar sail]]s and tilting them in the right direction, the flyer will be capable of altering its speed and direction to keep in position.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling"&gt;{{cite web

Such a group of sunshades would need to occupy an area of about 3.8 million square kilometers if placed at the L1 point.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling" /&gt; The deployment of the flyers is an issue that requires new technology.  Large [[railgun]]s or [[coilgun]]s are proposed to fire a capsule containing a million shades into space every 5 minutes for 10 years using 20 separate launch sites.

Even so, it would still take years to launch enough of the disks into [[orbit]] to have any effect.  This means a long [[lead time]].  Roger Angel of the University of Arizona&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stiles| first=Lori| title=Space sunshade might be feasible in global warming emergency| url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-11/uoa-ssm110306.php| work="Feasibility of cooling the Earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near L1,"| publisher=Eurekalert| accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented the idea for a sunshade at the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] in April 2006 and won a [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts grant for further research in July 2006.

Creating this sunshade in space was estimated to cost in excess of US$5&amp;nbsp;trillion with an estimated lifetime of 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A similar massive level of technological innovation and financial investment could ensure that. But if the planet gets into an abrupt climate crisis that can only be fixed by cooling, it would be good to be ready with some shading solutions that have been worked out."&lt;ref name="L1_cooling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory 2006-11-03"&gt;{{cite press release

===One Fresnel lens===
[[Image:Space lens.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. A 1,000-kilometre diameter lens is sufficient, and much smaller than what is shown in this simplified image. As a [[Fresnel lens]] it would be only a few millimeters thick.]]

Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large lens in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. This plan was proposed in 1989 by J.&amp;nbsp;T. Early.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;{{Citation

In 2004, physicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] calculated that a [[concave lens|concave]] rotating [[Fresnel lens]] 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the {{L1}} point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%.&lt;ref name="Benford1"&gt;See [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/7/41932/19363 Russell Dovey, "Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming] and [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 Bill Christensen, "Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153949/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 |date=2009-04-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of such a lens has been disputed. At a science fiction convention in 2004, Benford estimated that it would cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] up front, and another $10&amp;nbsp;billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.&lt;ref name="Benford1"/&gt;

===One diffraction grating===
A similar approach involves placing a very large [[diffraction grating]] (thin wire mesh) in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. A proposal for a 3,000 ton diffraction mesh was made in 1997 by [[Edward Teller]], [[Lowell Wood]], and [[Roderick Hyde]],&lt;ref name="Teller1997"&gt;{{Citation

==Spacecraft sunshades==
The [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) infrared telescope has a layered sunshade to keep the telescope cold.

For spacecraft approaching the sun the sunshade is usually called a heatshield. Notable spacecraft [designs] with heatshields include :
* [[Parker Solar Probe]] (was Solar Probe Plus), launched 2018 (carbon, carbon-foam, carbon sandwich heatshield)
* [[Solar Orbiter]], may launch 2020
* [[Messenger (spacecraft)|Messenger]], orbits Mercury, has a ceramic cloth sunshade
* [[BepiColumbo]], to orbit Mercury, with Optical Solar Reflectors (acting as a sunshade) on the Planetary Orbiter component.

The '''Stop Our Ship (SOS)''' movement, a component of the overall civilian and GI movements against the Vietnam War, was directed towards and developed onboard U.S. Navy ships, particularly aircraft carriers heading to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="EVW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1647C|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, A Political, Social, and Military History, Second Edition 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=275, 1759}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was concentrated on and around major U.S. Naval stations and ships on the West Coast from mid-1970 to the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and at its height involved tens of thousands of antiwar civilians, military personnel and veterans. It was sparked by the tactical shift of U.S. combat operations in Southeast Asia from the ground to the air. As the ground war stalemated and Army grunts increasingly refused to fight or resisted the war in various other ways, the U.S. “turned increasingly to air bombardment” &lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Heinl”&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Heinl |first=Robert D. |date=1971-06-07 |title=THE COLLAPSE OF THE ARMED FORCES |url=https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/Vietnam/heinl.html |magazine=Armed Forces Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;. By 1972 there were twice as many Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin as previously and the antiwar movement, which was at its height in the U.S. and worldwide, became a significant factor in the Navy. While no ships were actually prevented from returning to war, the campaigns, combined with the broad antiwar and rebellious sentiment of the times, stirred up substantial difficulties for the Navy, including active duty sailors refusing to sail with their ships, circulating petitions and antiwar propaganda onboard, disobeying orders, and committing sabotage, as well as persistent civilian antiwar activity in support of dissident sailors. Several ship combat missions were postponed or altered and one ship was delayed by a combination of a civilian blockade and crewmen jumping overboard. &lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=David|date=2005|title=Soldiers In Revolt|url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt|location=Chicago, IL|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=1931859272|author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112-113, 115-116}}&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutto|first=Jonathan|date=2008|title=Anti-War Soldier|location=New York, NY|publisher=Nation Books|pages=63-64|isbn=978-1-56858-378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=H.

The major targets of the SOS movement were four different aircraft carriers, the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']], the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)|USS ''Coral Sea'']], the [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']] and the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']], with lesser but significant activity on and around a number of other ships.

== USS Constellation ==
The first effort began in 1970 in [[San Diego]], the principal homeport of the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/port-san-diego/], Naval Base San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; An antiwar group, '''San Diego Nonviolent Action''', came up with idea of trying to stop an aircraft carrier from returning to Vietnam through education and non-violent action like a harbor blockade or through preventing sailors from getting to the naval base. They joined with other antiwar forces including a newly formed organization of antiwar military officers called the [[Concerned Officers Movement]] and decided to focus their efforts on the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']]. Very quickly this effort, which came to be called The Harbor Project (the SOS name developed later), expanded into a multi-faceted campaign and set the spark for the larger SOS movement to come.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Nonviolent_Action_Harbor_Project_Initial_Statement_April_1971.jpg], ''San Diego Nonviolent Action'' Anti-Aircraft Carrier Initial Statement; accessed December 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt;

===Constellation Vote===

[[File:Connstellation Vote Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster used for the Constellation Vote]]

The plan to stop an aircraft carrier attracted antiwar activists from all over California, including [[Joan Baez]] and [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/dg760vz2991 Joan Baez Wearing Stay Home For Peace T-Shirt], Joan Baez Prior to Singing at a Constellation Vote Rally&lt;/ref&gt; Harris suggested organizing a citywide referendum on whether the Constellation should set sail, and soon hundreds of activists, including sailors and veterans, were canvassing the city organizing the '''Constellation Vote'''. This led to a citywide straw vote in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a "real" vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable.&lt;ref name="War Foes"&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-09-19 |title=WAR FOES FIGHTING CARRIER'S RETURN; San Diego Poll Being Taken on Constellation's Future|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-09-26|title=Protest Vote Fails To Bar the Sailing Of Carrier to Asia|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/1620/rec/1892|title=Liberty call (San Diego Concerned Officers Movement) :: GI Press Collection|website=content.wisconsinhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/19335/rec/2] Constellation Vote Poster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/browse/the-connie-vote-the-uss-constellation-and-the-peace-movement-in-san-diego-1971 The Connie Vote: The USS Constellation and the Peace Movement in San Diego, 1971], The Bob Fitch Photography Archive at Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; The commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying "never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts."&lt;ref name="Mutiny"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guttridge|first=Leonard|date=1992|title=Mutiny: A History of Naval Insurrection |url=https://www.usni.org/store/books/bluejacket-books/mutiny|location=Annapolis, MD|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0870212818}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–56}}

===Antiwar Military Personnel===
The involvement of large numbers of antiwar officers and enlisted men created significant debate in the traditionally pro-military town. It also permitted creative methods not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as the CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner frequently seen being towed over the city by recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler, and the Constellation Vote stickers found everywhere on board the USS Constellation, including in the captain's personal bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/cj188gr6022|title=Plane flying over San Diego with banner "CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE"|last=Fitch|first=Bob|date=1971|quote=John Huyler flying with banner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/qn860wq8461 Constellation Vote Logo], Constellation Vote Logo Used on Stickers and Flyers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skelly |first=James |date=2017 |title=The Sarcophagus of Identity: Tribalism, Nationalism, and the Transcendence of the Self |location=Stuttgart |publisher=ibidem Verlag |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-598566010/praxis-underground-newspaper-v1-no7-october-6#fullscreen Praxis Underground Newspaper V.1 No.7, October 6, 1971 p.9], "Stay Home For Peace Stickers" Land GI in Brig&lt;/ref&gt; Bathroom stickers weren't the only complication the Captain had to deal with. Over 1,300 of the ship's sailors signed a petition requesting actress Jane Fonda's antiwar [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] Show, known to most GI's as the "Fuck The Army" show, be allowed onboard. The captain refused this request but then got himself in hot water by intercepting and destroying 2,500 pieces of U.S. mail sent by antiwar activists to crewmembers. Faced with a possible court of inquiry and health problems, the captain was removed from command before the ship sailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-06-07 |title=Inquiry Asked in Navy Antiwar Material Case|work=The San Diego Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="War Foes"/&gt;

===Research and Pamphlet===
Laying the basis for the broader SOS movement to come, a considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], who was then a visiting Professor of History at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/wbwatson/www/|title=MIT History|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons "used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10318752], ''Attack Carrier: The Constellation Papers'', September 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Connie 9===
When the Constellation set sail for Vietnam in on Oct 1, 1971 nine of its crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church, [https://www.ctksandiego.org Christ the King]. The "Connie 9", as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-10-03 |title=9 Constellation Sailors Seized, Flown to Ship|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-12-08 |title='We've Won,' 8 Sailors Say on Discharge|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== USS Coral Sea ==
As news of the efforts to stop the sailing of the Constellation spread, crewmen aboard the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)|USS ''Coral Sea'']], an aircraft carrier stationed at the Alameda Naval Air Station in the San Francisco area, decided to circulate a petition and the SOS movement officially acquired its name. Their “Stop Our Ship” petition stated in all capital letters: “THE SHIP CAN BE PREVENTED FROM TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN THE CONFLICT IF WE THE MAJORITY VOICE OUR OPINION THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE VIETNAM WAR.” It then asked fellow sailors to sign if they felt the ship should not go to Vietnam. The petition was started on September 12, 1971 and within three days it had gathered 300 signatures, at which point the ship Executive Officer ordered it confiscated.&lt;ref name="SOS Leaflet"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/14339/rec/11], Stop Our Ship Leaflet p.2 (USS Coral Sea)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/81191/rec/45], Stop Our Ship Petition (USS Coral Sea)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten Years"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rees |first1=Stephen |last2=Wiley |first2=Peter |year=2011 |editor1-last=Carlsson |editor1-first=Chris |editor2-last=Elliott |editor2-first=Lisa Ruth |title=Up Against the Bulkhead |url=http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=87286100958430 |journal=Ten Years That Shook the City: San Francisco 1968-1978 |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=City Lights Publishers |pages=109-120 |isbn=1-931404-12-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiwar Activity Onboard Ship===

[[File:USSCoralSea SOS Larry+BobMusaSpeak Roll337 Shot29 workprint.jpg|thumb|left|Active duty sailors, Bob Musa (left) and Larry Harris (right) speak at a protest rally.]]

Undeterred, the antiwar sailors created dozens of new copies and begin recirculating it with instructions about how to avoid confiscation. The military brass, however, declared the petition illegal and arrested three crewmen for passing out antiwar literature. With the ship now at sea for pre-deployment trials, a tit-for tat battle erupted. On September 28, 14 sailors passed out petitions and an antiwar GI underground newspaper in the mess hall in front of the Captain. The Captain responded by having several men arrested, some of whom claimed they were beaten in the brig. Word of these activities reached the civilian antiwar movement in the San Francisco area and when the Coral Sea passed under the Golden Gate Bridge as it returned to port on October 7, a large SOS banner was hung over the side of the bridge. Seventy crewmen responded in kind forming the letters SOS on the flight deck as the ship passed under the bridge. The Navy then began to discharge those it viewed as leaders of the petition drive.&lt;ref name="SOS Leaflet"/&gt;

===Protests Spread===

[[File:USSCoralSea SOS Megaphone3Yell Roll330 Shot32.jpg|thumb|400px|Four active duty sailors from the USS Coral Sea lead large antiwar march on Nov. 6 1971.]]

===On the Way to Vietnam===
When the Coral Sea arrived in Hawaii in late November, it was greeted by a special performance in Honolulu of the [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] antiwar show, featuring [[Jane Fonda]], [[Donald Sutherland]], and [[Country Joe McDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/44766/rec/6], Liberated Barracks Vol.1 No.3 Nov. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; More than 4,000 people attended, including approximately 2,500 members of the military and several hundred sailors from the Coral Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-11-26|title=F.T.A.

== USS Kitty Hawk ==

[[File:Stop the Hawk antiwar sticker.jpg|thumb|left|Stop the Hawk sticker, found all over the ship.]]

[[File:Stop the Hawk.jpg|thumb|400px|Stop the Hawk protesters]]

Meanwhile, back in [[San Diego]], another aircraft carrier, the [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']], was preparing for deployment to Southeast Asia. Sailors on board, with help from the Concerned Military (the San Diego [[Concerned Officers Movement]] had broadened its membership to include enlisted personnel and changed its name) and civilian antiwar forces, began publishing their own newspaper called ''Kitty Litter'' and organizing a personalized version of SOS called “Stop the Hawk”. They circulated an antiwar petition which gathered several hundred signatures, but most copies were confiscated by higher ups. On November 15, 1972 around 150 Kitty Hawk crewmen attended a rally to hear [[Joan Baez]] sing and listen to four of their crewmates speak out against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1972-02-16|title=Joan Baez Stars at Antiwar Rally|work=The San Diego Union p.B8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, when the ship set sail for Indochina, 7 members of the crew publicly refused to sail and took refuge in local churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1972-02-17|title=Kitty Hawk Sailing Today for Vietnam|work=The San Diego Union p.B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

With the ship at sea, copies of ''Kitty Litter'' continued to be published by civilian supporters and mailed to antiwar crewmen who circulated them onboard and submitted articles. One article published in the August 1972 issue pointed to a serious problem onboard: "In two consecutive masts, Captain Townsend has put several black men into the brig for fighting with white men, while dismissing "with a warninn" a white man who spoke in a demeaning manner to a black man and then proceeded to punch him in the stomach! Needless to say, this angered the black men on board, as well as many white men". Clearly more trouble was brewing on the ''Hawk'' that was soon starkly revealed (see below).&lt;ref name="Kitty Litter"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/98297/rec/12], Kitty Litter (USS Kitty Hawk Newsletter) 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

== USS Enterprise ==
The world first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']], the Navy’s pride and joy, was not immune from dissention. In mid-1972 a number of dissident sailors on board began publishing a mock version of the ship’s official paper the ''Enterprise Ledger''. Called the ''SOS Enterprise Ledger'', it was virtually identical to the original except that it contained an antiwar and rebellious message. The ship’s commanding officer responded by issuing regulations prohibiting the distribution of literature he hadn't approved. The SOS sailors decided they needed to learn more about military law and attended a class called “Turning the Regs Around” conducted by the ''Bay Area Military Law Panel''. They then wrote and distributed a pamphlet outlining the legal rights of GIs.

They then knew they could legally petition Congress so they created a petition opposing both the war in Vietnam and the military's denial of basic G.I. rights. The petition began circulating on board and was quickly gathering signatures when it was confiscated by the brass. The Navy was quite alarmed by this activity onboard their showpiece ship and Naval Intelligence agents were called in. They began interrogating known SOS activists about alleged sabotage incidents and threatening revocation of security clearances. Since most of the agents’ questions were about SOS, SOS plans and past SOS activity, it seemed to the sailors that they were trying to find out more about SOS through scare tactics – as one sailor put it, “making us think we were going to be charged with sabotage to scare us into talking to clear ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8332/rec/1], SOS Newsletter September 1972 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; When the ship set sail from [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda Naval Air Station]] on September 12, 1972, 5 SOS organizers were escorted off the ship under armed guard, while antiwar GI's, vets and civilians protested on shore and members of the "Peoples Blockade" sailed small boats in the San Francisco Bay symbolically blocking the Enterprise.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

==Other Aircraft Carriers==
When the [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'']] left Alameda NAS in April 1972, sixteen enlisted men assigned to Fighter Squadron 151 onboard the carrier signed an antiwar letter to President Nixon.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|114}}

Onboard the [[USS Ticonderoga (CV-14)|USS ''Ticonderoga'']] in San Diego, sailors organized a movement they called “Stop It Now” (SIN), and 3 of the crew refused to board the ship when it set sail in May 1972. Once at sea, protests continued and there were reports of antiwar meetings of as many as 75 crew members.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|114}}

In Norfolk, Virginia, on the East Coast, civilian antiwar groups organized against the sailing of the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']]. When it began to leave port on June 5, 1972, thirty-one activists in thirteen canoes and kayaks positioned themselves in front of the massive ship. “When the Coast Guard moved in to clear the demonstrators, hundreds of sailors on the deck of the America jeered and pelted the cutters with garbage; in a clear show of support for the protesters.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|114-115}}

Also in June, but back up at Alameda, civilians were protesting the pending departure of the [[USS Oriskany (CV-34)|USS ''Oriskany'']]. “When the ship left, on June 6, as estimated twenty-five crew members refused to sail, including a group of ten men who turned themselves in to naval authorities on June 13 and issued a bitter public" statement.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|115}} In part they said: "the only way to end the genocide being perpetrated now in South East Asia is for us, the actual pawns in the political game, to quit playing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/87007/rec/67], Camp News August 15, 1972 p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilian and Veteran Support Groups for SOS ==
Given the strict discipline within the military as well as the not uncommon heavy handed response to internal dissent from military commanders, civilian support was an essential part of these military protests.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=David L. |date=2017 |title=Dangerous Grounds: Antiwar Coffeehouses and Military Dissent in the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469632018/dangerous-grounds/ |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1-4696-3201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4, 74-75}}&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|53-4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Mark |date=1970-02-13 |title=Cops Attack Anti-war GIs |work=Los Angeles Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning civilians and military veterans (many newly discharged from the very same ships) played a supporting role in the key Navy ports.
 
===Center for Servicemen’s Rights===
In San Diego, the local antiwar groups, including some of those who had waged the initial campaign against the USS ''Constellation'', took their support to a more organized level by banding together in 1972 to form the ''Center for Servicemen’s Rights''. They rented a large storefront space in the middle of the main GI strip which contained a bookstore, mimeo, meeting rooms and a stage; staffed by a "collective of volunteers that included active duty sailors, a few Marines, veterans, and civilian activists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohn |first1=Marjorie |last2=Gilberd |first2=Kathleen |date=2009 |title=Rules of Disengagement |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780981576923/ |location=New York, NY |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=9780981576923}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provided individual and group counselling on GI rights, conscience objection and other means of opposing the war, as well as support for sailors who wanted to publish their own newspapers, leaflets or articles.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

===Up Against the Bulkhead===
The [[San Francisco]] underground GI newspaper ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' and its staff played an important role in supporting the SOS movement, particularly the dissident sailors of the ''Coral Sea''. Founded in 1970, by late 1971 it could be found everywhere GIs congregated in the San Francisco Bay Area and sailors knew where to go when they wanted counterculture help and friendship. As two ''Bulkhead'' staffers reported years later, "In 1971 a handful of sailors from the USS Coral Sea" showed up at the ''Bulkhead'' office "ready for action". The sailors "were a colorful lot, veritable hippies in uniform...more than eager not only to investigate ways to oppose the war, but also ways to sample the offerings of countercultural hedonism." With ''Bulkhead'' support the sailors went on to start the first SOS petition and officially launch the ''Stop Our Ship'' name.&lt;ref name="Ten Years"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quirkyberkeley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Coral-Sea.png], Poster: ''A Warship Can Be Stopped - Support the Men of the Coral Sea''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/89923/rec/25], ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' Underground Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subic Bay GI Center===

In January 1972, attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild, worked with several active duty sailors to create a support center in [[Olongapo]], [[Philippines]], just outside [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], the largest U.S. Navy installation in the Pacific at that time. Sparked by the appearance of the FTA Show in December, the center was soon publishing an underground newspaper called ''Seasick''. The center supported dissenting GIs and worked to improve the conditions for sailors on shore leave, including by helping sailors gather over 500 signatures on a petition against police brutality by the Shore Patrol. The center was swiftly put out of business in September 1972 when martial law was declared in the Philippines (see below).&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|116}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8082/rec/2], ''Seasick'' Underground Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOS Offices===
There were SOS Offices in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], serving the San Francisco Bay Area, and [[Los Angeles]]. In Los Angeles, the office opened in January 1972 with SOS standing for ''Support Our Soldiers'', carrying on efforts initiated several years earlier by supporters of the GI Coffeehouse movement. They began putting out a newsletter called ''SOS News'' and announced in their first issue that they were “a support office for the GI Movement.” They pledged to take responsibility for “raising money, providing literature and films, recruiting staff, maintaining communications and providing publicity for GI coffeehouses and projects.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8171/rec/4], SOS News Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; In Oakland, the Support Our Soldiers office offered similar supprt to the GI movement. Their newsletter stated that they would "try to fill the needs for money, staff, educational materials, and communication that individual organizing projects cannot fulfill themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/3406/rec/2], SOS News Oakland&lt;/ref&gt;

== Increased Air War Leads to Increased Resistance ==
In March 1972 the last U.S. ground combat division was withdrawn from Vietnam just as the North Vietnamese Army launched the Nguyễn Huệ or [[Easter Offensive]]. The U.S. responded by massively increasing its air war. “One main component was to be a flotilla of Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers (twice as many as in 1971) massed in the Gulf of Tonkin”. As the air and naval activity in the Pacific intensified, drastic changes occurred within the Navy. “During the remainder of the year, as many as four carriers…were on combat station in the Tonkin Gulf at one time…. Normal fleet routine was completely disrupted…. For the crew members involved, the escalation created severe hardships”. And as the concerns of sailors for their safety at sea "became entangled with the enlarged Indochina war effort" it "led to protests against conditions that under other circumstances might have been bearable but, for the purpose of bombing Vietnam, were seen as intolerable”.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|114, 117}} Many of the sailors were already ambivalent or even antagonistic to the war, and now they were confronted with extremely intense and difficult, even unsafe, working conditions. The U.S.’s new strategy “was torpedoed by a massive antiwar movement among the sailors, who combined escalating protests and rebellions with a wide-spread campaign of sabotage.”&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

===Great Lakes Naval Station===
The Navy’s sudden need for additional personnel greatly intensified the pressure for new recruits and training. The [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]], located north of Chicago, IL, is the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. On May 20, 1972, the [[Movement for a Democratic Military]] (MDM) and the ''Chicago Area Military Project'' organized an Armed Forces Day demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000. Soon a petition was being circulated on the base opposing the increased speed-up in training that gathered more than 600 signatures.

===USS Nitro===

[[File:USS Nitro Blockade - Fragging Action June 1972.jpg|thumb|400px|Canoes and small boats attempting to blockade the USS Nitro as it departed for Vietnam.]]

Crew members aboard the USS Nitro, a munitions ship loaded with armament at the Naval Weapons Station in Earle, New Jersey, staged one of the most dramatic protests. Worried about the war and the unsafe conditions on board they contacted civilian antiwar organizations who helped them draw up a list of specific shipboard hazards, which they circulated, gathering signatures from 48 members of the crew. The petition resulted in little change, but on April 24, 1972 as the ship was pulling out of port it was greeted by an antiwar blockade of seventeen canoes and small boats. As the Coast Guard attempted to disperse the demonstrators, they were first confronted by dissent from within their ranks&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8171/rec/4], SOS News Los Angeles May 1972 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;, and then, one of the Nitro’s crew on the “ship’s deck suddenly stood up on the rail, raised the clenched-fist salute, and literally jumped overboard!” He was quickly followed by six more crew members, including one non-swimmer who had donned a life jacket.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|118}}
 
William Monks, one of the seven who jumped explained his actions later: 

{{Quote
|text=I jumped from my ship because of my beliefs against the war and the killing in Vietnam. I also jumped to support the anti-war protesters who valiantly tried to keep the Nitro from leaving for Vietnam. I also jumped for the many oppressed people in the military that think like myself, but because of the way the military functions, no one ever listens to these people…. I see no reason why I should have to fight in Vietnam. I didn't start this war. I have nothing against the Vietnamese people, they never hurt me or my family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8171/rec/4], SOS News Los Angeles May 1972 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Racial Conflicts and Resistance ==
Col. Robert D. Heinl, Jr. stated in a 1971 study in the ''Armed Forces Journal'' called “The Collapse of the Armed Forces”, that “Internally speaking, racial conflicts and drugs…are tearing the services apart today.”&lt;ref name=”Heinl”/&gt; Historians of the war have documented that non-white GIs were often given the dirtiest jobs and frequently sent to the front lines in combat situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=African Americans at War: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |year=2004 |page=502 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=1576077462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And a task force reporting to the Secretary of Defense at the time, [[Melvin R. Laird]], found that racial discrimination in the military was not confined to the military but was “also a problem of a racist society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-12-07 |title=Navy May Change Hats to Accommodate Blacks |work=Los Angeles Sentinel |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Gerald Gill contended that by 1970 most black soldiers thought the war was a mistake, “hypocritical in intent and racist and imperialist by design.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gill |first=Gerald |year=1990 |editor-last=Walter |editor-first=Capps |title=Black Soldiers Perspectives on the War |journal=The Vietnam Reader |publisher=Routledge |pages=173-4, 181 |isbn=1136635629}}&lt;/ref&gt; One black soldier was quoted as saying that black soldiers were sent on risky assignments by white officers so that ‘there would be one less nigger to worry about back home.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Herman |date=2003 |title=The Brothers' Vietnam War: Black Power, Manhood, and the Military Experience |url=http://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813026466 |location=Gainesville, FL  |publisher=University of Florida Press |isbn=0813026466 |page=21, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the problems that Heinl and others were describing in the Army were about to explode in the Navy. As an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' put it, “The Navy, with its tradition of Filipino waiters and Southern WASP leadership, never really was an alternative for America's young city blacks during the early years of the Vietnam war.”&lt;ref name="Some Very"&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-11-12 |first=Seymour |last=Hersh |title=Some Very Unhappy Ships |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, Navy commanders under pressure to increase recruitment to meet the needs of the expanding air war, “decided to change the Navy's image and its appeal to blacks.” By late 1972 approximately 12 percent “of new Navy recruits were black”, and they “were typically assigned to the ship's most miserable jobs”,&lt;ref name="Navy Times"&gt;{{cite news |date=2017-02-28 |first=Mark |last=Faram |title=Race Riot at Sea - 1972 Kitty Hawk Incident Fueled Fleet-Wide Unrest |work=Navy Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often "thrust into the dreariest, most menial, and most unpopular jobs on board"&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|259}} Several unprecedented developments on board U.S. Navy ships dramatically exposed the intersection of antiwar sentiment, civil rights issues, discontent over working and safety conditions and racism. One of the first of these incidents highlighted many of the common threads between them.

===Troublemakers in the Philippines===
When martial law was declared in the [[Philippines]] in September 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-09-23 |title=Defense Chief Unharmed - Philippines Sets Martial Law After Attack on Aide |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Navy “used the occasion to crack down on so-called troublemakers and…loaded more than two hundred enlisted men from eleven different ships onto planes for immediate transfer back to San Diego.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|119}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/35265/rec/4], ''Up From the Bottom" Underground Newspaper, Vol. 2 No. 6 p.8, Dec 15, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Once in San Diego many of the men wanted to let the public know what had happened and on October 24 “a racially mixed group of thirty-one enlisted men held a press conference to denounce the deplorable conditions, harassment, and racial prejudice they encountered while at sea.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|119}} Their statement, partially excerpted here, captured many of the issues swirling within the Navy at that time:

{{Quote
|text=We, the undersigned demand an end to the mistreatment and harassment that we have received from the United States Navy…. Living and working conditions on the ships were very poor. People had to work 14-16 hours a day. This Included watch and work. While we were on the line we got 4-6 hours sleep a night. At times we would work 24-36 hours straight without sleep…. There was a lot of pressure from our superiors. They keep trying to get us to do Jobs faster…. The superiors take out their frustrations on the enlisted people and especially on people of color.

The Captains and the command pushes the men and the machines to the breaking point. As a result the men turn to alcohol and drugs. It is an escape from the tension that is put on your mind and body by the long working hours and conditions. When the dope runs out or when the tension gets too great, fights break out on the ships. The tension results in racial fighting.

We demand an investigation into the working conditions, the living conditions, the tension on the Navy ships. We also demand an investigation to the drug program and the racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/8171/rec/4], SOS News Los Angeles Dec 1972 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Kitty Hawk Riot===
In October 1972 the Hawk pulled into Subic Bay after 8 months at sea, expecting a rest before heading home. Instead, the crew was notified they were returning to combat operations in Indochina. Tensions, already high from accelerated combat operations, flared even more. Blacks made up 7 percent of the enlisted crew on board the Hawk, and the majority of them “were assigned to the toughest and dirtiest Navy jobs, in the deck force and on flight decks, while whites populated the more coveted and higher tech jobs in the crew.”&lt;ref name="Navy Times"/&gt; The black crew members felt that had been “treated like dogs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-11-29 |first=Earl |last=Caldwell |title=Kitty Hawk Back at Home Port; Sailors Describe Racial Conflict |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a strong sense of black pride and influenced by the civil rights and Black Power movements in the U.S., they were very unhappy with their conditions. During the nights prior to deployment, several racial incidents occurred in Subic Bay enlisted men’s club. On October 8, a black sailor went on stage and shouted "Black power! This war is the white man's war!" and then continued to preach to the drunken crowd. A glass was thrown that hit him in the head, and a fight between blacks and whites broke out. On October 11, the night before the ship was to depart, a larger black-white fight erupted in the EM club which was broken up by a marine riot squad with clubs. Five black and four white sailors were arrested but returned to the ship before it departed. Back at sea, unhappy about being redeployed and overworked, many of the crew were now also deeply angry over racial tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Gregory A. |date=2009 |title=Troubled Water: Race, Mutiny, and Bravery on the USS Kitty Hawk |url=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780230103399 |location=New York, NY  |publisher=St. Martins Press |isbn=0230100546 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once underway on October 12, an investigating officer began an inquiry into the fight by summoning several black sailors. “This [singling out of blacks only] was hard to understand in terms of the tensions” the NY Times quoted an officer saying “who had access to all of the reports of the incident.” One of those summoned brought “nine companions with him and grew belligerent”. The nine then stormed out to join other black sailors on the mess deck with the crowd soon growing to over one hundred. The chief master-at-arms became alarmed and summoned the marines, a move which was described later by “officialdom” as the first of “a series of mistakes” and an explosive situation quickly developed.&lt;ref name="Some Very"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|120-121}}&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|261-267}}

The ship’s executive officer ordered the blacks and the Marines to separate ends of the ship, but the Captain issued conflicting orders. In the ensuing confusion, the blacks and the Marines ran into each other on the hanger deck and a fight broke out. “The fighting spread rapidly, with bands of blacks and whites marauding throughout the ship’s decks and attaching each other with fists, chains, wrenches, and pipes.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|120-121}} More conflicting orders were issued resulting in more confusion and fights raged on for much of the night. The fights left 40 white and 6 black sailors injured, including three who had to be evacuated to onshore medical facilities.&lt;ref name="Navy Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1973-04-11 |title=Last Trial is Held in Kitty Hawk Case |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By morning, a tense calm was achieved and normal flight operations were resumed.&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|266}} However, once arrests were made for the fighting, all of the 25 arrested were black. “The arrest pattern caused as grave concern in some areas of the Pentagon as the outbreak itself. ‘Anytime you have a so-called race riot and you lock up 28 blacks,’ one black Navy official noted caustically during a recent interview, ‘that has to raise some questions.’”&lt;ref name="Some Very"/&gt;

===Mutiny on the Constellation===
As word spread in the fleet about the incidents onboard the Kitty Hawk, many of the black sailors on the Constellation were “swearing an affinity with their beleaguered brothers on the Kitty Hawk.”&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|268}} By late October 1972, with the ship undergoing training exercises of the coast of Southern California, black crewmembers formed an organization called the “Black Fraction,” “with the aim of protecting minority interests in promotion policies and in the administration of military justice.” They elected a “chairman and three spokesmen to deal with the officers and petty officers of the ship.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|121-122}}&lt;ref name="Sort Of"&gt;{{cite news |date=1973-02-18 |first=Henry |last=Leifermann |title=A sort of mutiny: The Constellation Incident |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As commanders became aware of the Black Faction, they agreed to a meeting between them and the executive officer with the objective of easing tensions. Prior to the meeting, however, the command “singled out fifteen members of Black Faction as agitators and ordered that six of them be given immediate less-than-honorable discharges.” At the same time, notice was given ship wide that 250 men would be administratively discharged. Feeling they were being singled out for retaliation for their activism and fearing that most of the additional discharges would be directed at them, over one hundred sailors, including several whites, staged a sit in and refused to work on the morning of November 3.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|121-122}}&lt;ref name="Sort Of"/&gt;

During the day, members of the ship’s Human Relations Council attempted to meet with the mutineers in a private dining room with little success as they demanded to see the captain. Around midnight, with the sit-in continuing the captain announced to the ship that any complaints had to go through the chain of command. “’O.K., that’s it,’ shouted a black sailor in the dining room. ‘They want another Kitty Hawk.’ There were shouts of ‘Let’s get the captain,’ and ‘Let’s take the ship.” The Captain then called general quarters and ordered senior officers and petty officers to pick out white sailors and move to the mess deck to surround the mutineers where they had now moved. A tense standoff ensued that slowly dissipated overnight.&lt;ref name="Some Very"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|274}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-11-16 |first=Earl |last=Caldwell |title=Black Sailors and Ship's Captain Accuse Each Other |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the morning the captain “washe[d] his hands of the mutineers. He [did] not want to admit mutiny, so he cannot charge the blacks with that. Yet he want[ed] them off his ship.”&lt;ref name="Some Very"/&gt; The captain, in consultation with others all the way up to the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, decided to cut sea operations short and set the dissidents ashore. Once docked, 144 crew members left the ship, including 8 whites. The Constellation returned to sea but returned a few days later to pick up the mutinous sailors. Most of the men, however, refused to board the ship and on November 9 “staged a defiant dockside strike - perhaps the largest act of mass defiance in naval history.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1972-11-10 |first=Everett |last=Holles |title=130 Refuse to Join Ship; Most Reassigned by Navy |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these unprecedented actions, none of the sailors were arrested, most were simply reassigned to other duty stations, while a few received what were described as “trifling punishments”.&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|121-122}}&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|280}}

==Sabotage as Resistance==
As early as 1970 ships had been forced out of action by sabotage by crew members. For example, in June 1970 the destroyer Richard B. Anderson “was kept from sailing to Vietnam for eight weeks when crew members deliberately wrecked an engine.”&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;{{rp|65}} But, in tandem with the SOS Movement, naval sabotage became an even more serious issue in 1972 as the air war dramatically expanded.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; “In July fires were started on the Forrestal and Ranger, the eighteenth instance of sabotage aboard the latter vessel, a prime target back home for peace activists’ ‘Stop Our Ships’ agitation.”&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|258}} The fire on the Forrestal resulted in over $7 million in damage and was the largest single act of sabotage in naval history. In March 1972 when the aircraft carrier USS Midway received orders for Vietnam, “dissident crewmen deliberately spilled three thousand gallons of oil into the bay. The captain of the Constellation “told a press conference in November of 1972 that ‘saboteurs were at work’ during the period of unrest aboard his ship.” The Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet stated in October 1972 that the increase in sabotage was a “grave liability” to the ability of the Navy to operate.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|121-122}}
 
“All told, by the close of that year the United States Navy would log seventy-four instances of sabotage, more than half on aircraft carriers, none of them attributable to ‘enemy’ action.”&lt;ref name="Mutiny"/&gt;{{rp|258}} An investigation by the House Armed Services Committee revealed how much the sabotage had undermined naval combat operations and contributed to other forms of unrest during the 1972 bombing campaign. They stated that the October 1972 redeployment of the Kitty Hawk to combat (discussed above) which resulted in riots and near mutiny was apparently “due to the incidents of sabotage aboard her sister ships U.S.S. Ranger and U.S.S. Forrestal.”&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;{{rp|123-126}}

== Conclusion ==
While the SOS movement had no cohesive central organization or leadership, it was united by the overarching, if ultimately unattained, goal of stopping warships from entering combat in Indochina. Despite this failure on the stated objective, it was a significant part of the latter stages of the overall anti-Vietnam War movement which did, in fact, help to end the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |date=2017 |title=A People's History of the United States |url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062397348/a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/ |location=New York, NY |publisher=Harper Perennial |page=469 |isbn=9780062397348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA simple2.svg|thumb|upright|The structure of a [[DNA]] molecule is essential to its function.]]
'''Structure''' is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or [[system]], or the object or system so organized.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=structure, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=Online |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/191895?rskey=pTgPk1&amp;amp;result=1|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material structures include man-made objects such as [[building]]s and [[machine]]s and natural objects such as [[organism|biological organisms]], [[mineral]]s and [[chemical substance|chemicals]]. Abstract structures include [[data structure]]s in [[computer science]] and [[musical form]]. Types of structure include a [[hierarchy]] (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a [[Complex network|network]] featuring many-to-many [[Link (geometry)|link]]s, or a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.

== Load-bearing ==
[[File:Sámi storehouse.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] food storage structure]]

Buildings, aircraft, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams and salt domes are all examples of [[Structural load|load]]-bearing structures. The results of [[construction]] are divided into [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure|non-building structure]]s, and make up the [[infrastructure]] of a human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into [[Structural engineering#Specializations|categories]] including building structures, [[architectural structure]]s, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.

The effects of loads on physical structures are determined through [[structural analysis]], which is one of the tasks of [[structural engineering]]. The [[Structural engineering#Structural elements|structural elements]] can be classified as one-dimensional ([[rope]]s, [[strut]]s, [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[arch]]es), two-dimensional ([[membrane]]s, plates, [[Concrete slab|slab]], [[Shell (structure)|shells]], [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]), or three-dimensional (solid masses).&lt;ref name=Carpinter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carpinteri|first1=Alberto|title=Structural Mechanics: A unified approach|date=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203474952}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The latter was the main option available to early structures such as [[Chichen Itza]]. A one-dimensional element has one dimension much larger than the other two, so the other dimensions can be neglected in calculations; however, the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition can determine the [[Flexural rigidity|flexural]] and [[Compressive strength|compressive]] stiffness of the element. Two-dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can resist biaxial traction.&lt;ref name=Carpinter/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

The structure elements are combined in ''structural systems''. The majority of everyday load-bearing structures are ''section-active'' structures like frames, which are primarily composed of one-dimensional (bending) structures. Other types are ''Vector-active'' structures such as [[truss]]es, ''surface-active'' structures such as shells and folded plates, ''form-active'' structures such as cable or membrane structures, and hybrid structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knippers|first1=Jan|last2=Cremers|first2=Jan|last3=Gabler|first3=Markus|last4=Lienhard|first4=Julian|title=Construction manual for polymers + membranes : materials, semi-finished products, form-finding design|date=2011|publisher=Institut für internationale Architektur-Dokumentation|location=München|isbn=9783034614702|edition=Engl. transl. of the 1. German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134–136}}

Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing biominerals and [[protein]]s, at the bottom of which are [[collagen|collagen fibrils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Z.|last2=Zhang|first2=Y.-W.|last3=Gao|first3=H.|title=On optimal hierarchy of load-bearing biological materials|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1 September 2010|volume=278|issue=1705|pages=519–525|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1093|pmid=20810437|pmc=3025673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Biological organisation}}

In [[biology]], structures exist at all levels of organization, ranging hierarchically from the [[atom]]ic and [[molecular]] to the [[cell (biology)|cellular]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[organism]]ic, [[population]] and [[ecosystem]] level. Usually, a higher-level structure is composed of multiple copies of a lower-level structure.

[[Structural biology]] is concerned with the [[biomolecular structure]] of [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banaszak|first1=Leonard J.|title=Foundations of Structural Biology.|date=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080521848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of these molecules is determined by their shape as well as their composition, and their structure has multiple levels. [[Protein structure]] has a four-level hierarchy. The ''[[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]'' is the sequence of [[amino acid]]s that make it up. It has a [[peptide]] backbone made up of a repeated sequence of a nitrogen and two carbon atoms. The ''[[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]]'' consists of repeated patterns determined by [[hydrogen bonding]]. The two basic types are the [[alpha helix|α-helix]] and the [[beta sheet|β-pleated sheet]]. The ''[[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]'' is a back and forth bending of the polypeptide chain, and the ''[[Protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]'' is the way that tertiary units come together and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=William K.|last2=Sadava|first2=David E.|last3=Orians|first3=Gordon H.|last4=H.

== Chemical ==
{{Main|Chemical structure}}
[[File:Dopamin - Dopamine.svg|thumb|right|A skeletal formula for [[dopamine]]]]
Chemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure. The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called [[structural formula]]s. [[Lewis structure]]s use a dot notation to represent the [[valence electron]]s for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the atom in chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeKock|first1=Roger L.|last2=Gray|first2=Harry B.|title=Chemical structure and bonding|date=1989|publisher=University Science Books|location=Mill Valley, Calif.|isbn=9780935702613|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71–72}} Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a simplified version of such a diagram, called a [[skeletal formula]], only carbon-carbon bonds and functional groups are shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Graham C.|last2=Holman|first2=John S.|title=Chemistry in context|date=2000|publisher=Nelson|location=Walton-on-Thames|isbn=9780174482765|page=391|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atoms in a crystal have a [[crystal structure|structure]] that involves repetition of a basic unit called a ''unit cell''. The atoms can be modeled as points on a [[Bravais lattice|lattice]], and one can explore the effect of  [[symmetry]] operations that include rotations about a point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and ''[[translation (geometry)|translations]]'' (movements of all the points by the same amount). Each crystal has a finite group, called the [[space group]], of such operations that map it onto itself; there are 230 possible space groups.&lt;ref name=Ashcroft&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=Neil W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N.

A large part of [[numerical analysis]] involves identifying and interpreting the structure of musical works.

== Social ==
{{Main|Social structure}}

A social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social [[organization]]s of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group. Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. [[Structure and agency]] are two confronted theories about human behaviour.  The debate surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of the central issues in sociology. In this context, ''agency'' refers to the individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. ''Structure'' here refers to factors such as [[social class]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.

== Data ==
{{Main|Data structure}}
[[File:Singly-linked-list.svg|thumb|right|In a singly linked list, each element has a data value and a pointer to the next element.]]
In [[computer science]], a data structure is a way of organizing information in a [[computer]] so that it can be used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Paul E. |last=Black |title=data structure |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]] |editor-first1=Vreda |editor-last1=Pieterse |editor-first2=Paul E. |editor-last2=Black |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date= 15 December 2004 |url=http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/datastructur.html |edition=Online |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data structures are built out of two basic types: An [[Array data structure|array]] has an index that can be used for immediate access to any data item, but depending on the [[programming language]] used, its size must be specified when it is [[Initialization (programming)|initialized]]. A [[linked list]] can be reorganized, grown or shrunk, but its elements must be accessed with a [[Reference (computer science)|pointer]] that links them together in a particular order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sedgewick|first1=Robert|last2=Wayne|first2=Kevin|title=Algorithms|date=2011|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=9780132762564|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156}} Out of these any number of other data structures can be created such as [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]], [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]], [[Tree (data structure)|trees]] and [[hash table]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Data structures|last1=Cormen|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Leiserson|first2=Charles E.|last3=Rivest|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Stein|first4=Clifford|title=Introduction to algorithms|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262033848|pages=229–339|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mehta|first1=Dinesh P.|chapter=Basic structures|editor-last1=Mehta|editor-first1=Dinesh P.|editor-last2=Sahni|editor-first2=Sartaj|title=Handbook of data structures and applications|date=2005|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computer and Information Science Series|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=9781420035179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
{{Main|Software architecture}}

In software architecture, the structure of software is the way in which it is partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one component without requiring changes in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorton|first1=Ian|title=Essential software architecture|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783642191763|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The structure can be represented in diagrams such as the [[Control Structure Diagram]] and the [[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diehl|first1=Stephan|title=Software visualization : visualizing the structure, behaviour, and evolution of software ; with 5 tables|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540465041|pages=38–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural elements reflect the requirements of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance, then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has backups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernardi|first1=Simona|last2=Merseguer|first2=José|last3=Petriu|first3=Dorina Corina|title=Model-Driven Dependability Assessment of Software Systems|date=2013|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642395123|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several systems in the [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System|url=https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch4-4.html|website=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical ==
As a branch of philosophy, [[logic]] is concerned with distinguishing good arguments from poor ones. A chief concern is with the structure of arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Structure of Arguments|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/structure.html|website=Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher=philosophy.lander.edu|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument consists of one or more [[premise]]s from which a conclusion is [[inference|inferred]].&lt;ref name=Kemerling&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemerling|first1=Garth|title=Arguments and Inference|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e01.htm|website=The Philosophy Pages|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps in this inference can be expressed in a formal way and their structure analyzed. Two basic types of inference are [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. In a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] deduction, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, regardless of whether they are true or not. An invalid deduction contains some error in the analysis. An inductive argument claims that if the premises are true, the conclusion is likely.&lt;ref name=Kemerling/&gt;

In [[philosophy]], a '''supertask''' is a [[countable set|countably infinite]] sequence of operations that occur sequentially within a finite interval of time.&lt;ref&gt;This concept relates to [[cardinal number]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when the number of operations becomes [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]]. A hypertask that includes one operation for each ordinal number is called an "ultratask".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Al-Dhalimy, Haidar |author2=Geyer, Charles |journal=The Review of Symbolic Logic |title=Surreal Time and Ultratasks |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/ |doi=10.1017/S1755020316000289 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=836–847 |date=December 2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''supertask'' was coined by the philosopher [[James F. Thomson (philosopher)|James F. Thomson]], who devised [[Thomson's lamp]]. The term ''hypertask'' derives from Clark and Read in their paper of that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Clark, Peter |author2=Read, Stephen |journal=Synthese |title=Hypertasks |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l632938j47u80732/ |doi=10.1007/BF00485061 |issn=1573-0964 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=387–390 |date=December 1984 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |accessdate=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Zeno===
====Motion====
The origin of the interest in supertasks is normally attributed to [[Zeno of Elea]]. Zeno claimed that [[Zeno's paradoxes|motion was impossible]]. He argued as follows: suppose our burgeoning "mover", Achilles say, wishes to move from A to B. To achieve this he must traverse half the distance from A to B. To get from the midpoint of AB to B Achilles must traverse half ''this'' distance, and so on and so forth. However many times he performs one of these "traversing" tasks there is another one left for him to do before he arrives at B. Thus it follows, according to Zeno, that motion (travelling a non-zero distance in finite time) is a supertask. Zeno further argues that supertasks are not possible (how can this sequence be completed if for each traversing there is another one to come?). It follows that motion is impossible.

Zeno's argument takes the following form:

# Motion is a supertask, because the completion of motion over any set distance involves an infinite number of steps
# Supertasks are impossible
# Therefore, motion is impossible

Most subsequent philosophers reject Zeno's bold conclusion in favor of common sense. Instead they turn his argument on its head (assuming it's valid) and take it as a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]] where the possibility of motion is taken for granted. They accept the possibility of motion and apply [[modus tollens]] ([[contrapositive]]) to Zeno's argument to reach the conclusion that either motion is not a supertask or not all supertasks are impossible.

====Achilles and the tortoise====

Zeno himself also discusses the notion of what he calls "[[Achilles]] and the tortoise". Suppose that Achilles is the fastest runner, and moves at a speed of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. Achilles chases a tortoise, an animal renowned for being slow, that moves at 0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, the tortoise starts 0.9 metres ahead. Common sense seems to decree that Achilles will catch up with the tortoise after exactly 1 second, but Zeno argues that this is not the case. He instead suggests that Achilles must inevitably come up to the point where the tortoise has started from, but by the time he has accomplished this, the tortoise will already have moved on to another point. This continues, and every time Achilles reaches the mark where the tortoise was, the tortoise will have reached a new point that Achilles will have to catch up with; while it begins with 0.9 metres, it becomes an additional 0.09 metres, then 0.009 metres, and so on, infinitely. While these distances will grow very small, they will remain finite, while Achilles' chasing of the tortoise will become an unending supertask. Much commentary has been made on this particular paradox; many assert that it finds a loophole in common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic|first=Chhanda|last=Chakraborti|year=2006|page=477|publisher=Prentice Hall of India|isbn=81-203-2855-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomson===
[[James F. Thomson (philosopher)|James F. Thomson]] believed that motion was not a supertask, and he emphatically denied that supertasks are possible. The proof Thomson offered to the latter claim involves what has probably become the most famous example of a supertask since Zeno. [[Thomson's lamp]] may either be on or off. At time t = 0 the lamp is off, at time t = 1/2 it is on, at time t = 3/4 (= 1/2 + 1/4) it is off, t = 7/8 (= 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8) it is on,  etc. The natural question arises: at t = 1 is the lamp on or off? There does not seem to be any non-arbitrary way to decide this question. Thomson goes further and claims this is a contradiction. He says that the lamp cannot be on for there was never a point when it was on where it was not immediately switched off again. And similarly he claims it cannot be off for there was never a point when it was off where it was not immediately switched on again. By Thomson's reasoning the lamp is neither on nor off, yet by stipulation it must be either on or off{{snd}} this is a contradiction. Thomson thus believes that supertasks are impossible.

===Benacerraf===
[[Paul Benacerraf]] believes that supertasks are at least logically possible despite Thomson's apparent contradiction. Benacerraf agrees with Thomson insofar as that the experiment he outlined does not determine the state of the lamp at t = 1. However he disagrees with Thomson that he can derive a contradiction from this, since the state of the lamp at t = 1 need not be logically determined by the preceding states. [[Logical consequence|Logical implication]] does not bar the lamp from being on, off, or vanishing completely to be replaced by a horse-drawn pumpkin. There are possible worlds in which Thomson's lamp finishes on, and worlds in which it finishes off not to mention countless others where weird and wonderful things happen at t = 1. The seeming arbitrariness arises from the fact that Thomson's experiment does not contain enough information to determine the state of the lamp at t = 1, rather like the way nothing can be found in Shakespeare's play to determine whether [[Hamlet]] was right- or left-handed.
So what about the contradiction? Benacerraf showed that Thomson had committed a mistake. When he claimed that the lamp could not be on because it was never on without being turned off again{{snd}} this applied only to instants of time ''strictly less than 1''. It does not apply to 1 because 1 does not appear in the sequence {0, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, …} whereas Thomson's experiment only specified the state of the lamp for times in this sequence.

===Modern literature===
Most of the modern literature comes from the descendants of Benacerraf, those who tacitly accept the possibility of supertasks. Philosophers who reject their possibility tend not to reject them on grounds such as Thomson's but because they have qualms with the notion of infinity itself. Of course there are exceptions. For example, McLaughlin claims that Thomson's lamp is inconsistent if it is analyzed with [[internal set theory]], a variant of [[real analysis]].

====Philosophy of mathematics====
If supertasks are possible, then the truth or falsehood of unknown propositions of number theory, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]], or even [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] propositions could be determined in a finite amount of time by a brute-force search of the set of all natural numbers. This would, however, be in contradiction with the [[Church-Turing thesis]]. Some have argued this poses a problem for [[intuitionism]], since the intuitionist must distinguish between things that cannot in fact be proven (because they are too long or complicated; for example [[George Boolos|Boolos]]'s "Curious Inference"&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boolos]]. "A curious inference." ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' 16: 1–12. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/30226368 JSTOR])&lt;/ref&gt;) but nonetheless are considered "provable", and those which ''are'' provable by infinite brute force in the above sense.

====Physical possibility====
Some have claimed Thomson's lamp is physically impossible since it must have parts moving at speeds faster than the [[speed of light]] (e.g., the lamp switch). [[Adolf Grünbaum]] suggests that the lamp could have a strip of wire which, when lifted, disrupts the circuit and turns off the lamp; this strip could then be lifted by a smaller distance each time the lamp is to be turned off, maintaining a constant velocity. However, such a design would ultimately fail, as eventually the distance between the contacts would be so small as to allow electrons to jump the gap, preventing the circuit from being broken at all.

Other physically possible supertasks have been suggested. In one proposal, one person (or entity) counts upward from 1, taking an infinite amount of time, while another person observes this from a frame of reference where this occurs in a finite space of time. For the counter, this is not a supertask, but for the observer, it is. (This could theoretically occur due to [[time dilation]], for example if the observer were falling into a [[black hole]] while observing a counter whose position is fixed relative to the singularity.)

Davies in his paper "Building Infinite Machines" concocted a device which he claims is physically possible up to infinite divisibility. It involves a machine which creates an exact replica of itself but has half its size and twice its speed. Still, for either a human or any device, to perceive or act upon the state of the lamp some measurement has to be done, for example the light from the lamp would have to reach an eye or a sensor. Any such measurement will take a fixed frame of time, no matter how small and, therefore, at some point measurement of the state will be impossible. Since the state at t=1 can not be determined even in principle, it is not meaningful to speak of the lamp being either on or off.

Gustavo E. Romero in the paper 'The collapse of supertasks'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1309.0144 |last1=Romero |first1=Gustavo E. |title=The collapse of supertasks |class=physics.hist-ph |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that any attempt to carry out a supertask will result in the formation of a [[black hole]], making supertasks physically impossible.

====Super Turing machines====
{{Main|Hypercomputation}}
The impact of supertasks on theoretical computer science has triggered some new and interesting work, for example Hamkins and Lewis{{snd}} "Infinite Time Turing Machine".

==Prominent supertasks==
===Ross-Littlewood paradox===
{{Main|Ross–Littlewood paradox}}
Suppose there is a jar capable of containing infinitely many marbles and an infinite collection of marbles labelled 1, 2, 3, and so on. At time ''t'' = 0, marbles 1 through 10 are placed in the jar and marble 1 is taken out. At ''t'' = 0.5, marbles 11 through 20 are placed in the jar and marble 2 is taken out; at ''t'' = 0.75, marbles 21 through 30 are put in the jar and marble 3 is taken out; and in general at time ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, marbles 10''n'' + 1 through 10''n'' + 10 are placed in the jar and marble ''n'' + 1 is taken out. How many marbles are in the jar at time ''t'' = 1?

One argument states that there should be infinitely many marbles in the jar, because at each step before ''t'' = 1 the number of marbles increases from the previous step and does so unboundedly. A second argument, however, shows that the jar is empty. Consider the following argument: if the jar is non-empty, then there must be a marble in the jar. Let us say that that marble is labeled with the number ''n''. But at time ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''n''th marble has been taken out, so marble ''n'' cannot be in the jar. This is a contradiction, so the jar must be empty. The Ross-Littlewood paradox is that here we have two seemingly perfectly good arguments with completely opposite conclusions.

Further complications are introduced by the following variant. Suppose that we follow the same process as above, but instead of taking out marble 1 at ''t'' = 0, one takes out marble 2. And, at ''t'' = 0.5 one takes out marble 3, at ''t'' = 0.75 marble 4, etc. Then, one can use the same logic from above to show that while at ''t'' = 1, marble 1 is still in the jar, no other marbles can be left in the jar. Similarly, one can construct scenarios where in the end, 2 marbles are left, or 17 or, of course, infinitely many. But again this is paradoxical: given that in all these variations the same number of marbles are added or taken out at each step of the way, how can the end result differ?

Some people decide to simply bite the bullet and say that apparently, the end result does depend on which marbles are taken out at each instant. However, one immediate problem with that view is that one can think of the thought experiment as one where none of the marbles are actually labeled, and thus all the above variations are simply different ways of describing the same process; it seems unreasonable to say that the end result of the one actual process depends on the way we describe what happens.

Moreover, Allis and Koetsier offer the following variation on this thought experiment: at ''t'' = 0, marbles 1 to 9 are placed in the jar, but instead of taking a marble out they scribble a 0 after the 1 on the label of the first marble so that it is now labeled "10". At ''t'' = 0.5, marbles 11 to 19 are placed in the jar, and instead of taking out marble 2, a 0 is written on it, marking it as 20. The process is repeated ad infinitum. Now, notice that the end result at each step along the way of this process is the same as in the original experiment, and indeed the paradox remains: Since at every step along the way, more marbles were added, there must be infinitely marbles left at the end, yet at the same time, since every marble with number ''n'' was taken out at ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt;, no marbles can be left at the end. However, in this experiment, no marbles are ever taken out, and so any talk about the end result 'depending' on which marbles are taken out along the way is made impossible.

A bare-naked variation that really goes straight to the heart of all of this goes as follows: at ''t'' = 0, there is one marble in the jar with the number 0 scribbled on it. At ''t'' = 0.5, the number 0 on the marble gets replaced with the number 1, at ''t'' = 0.75, the number gets changed to 2, etc. Now, no marbles are ever added to or removed from the jar, so at t = ''1'', there should still be exactly that one marble in the jar. However, since we always replaced the number on that marble with some other number, it should have some number ''n'' on it, and that is impossible because we know precisely when that number was replaced, and never repeated again later. In other words, we can also reason that no marble can be left at the end of this process, which is quite a paradox.

Of course, it would be wise to heed Benacerraf’s words that the states of the jars before ''t'' = 1 do not logically determine the state at ''t'' = 1. Thus, neither Ross’s or Allis’s and Koetsier’s argument for the state of the jar at ''t'' = 1 proceeds by logical means only. Therefore, some extra premise must be introduced in order to say anything about the state of the jar at ''t'' = 1. Allis and Koetsier believe such an extra premise can be provided by the physical law that the marbles have continuous space-time paths, and therefore  from the fact that for each ''n'', marble ''n'' is out of the jar for ''t'' &lt; 1, it must follow that it must still be outside the jar at ''t'' = 1 by continuity. Thus, the contradiction, and the paradox, remains.

One obvious solution to all these conundrums and paradoxes is to say that supertasks are impossible. If supertasks are impossible, then the very assumption that all of these scenarios had some kind of 'end result' to them is mistaken, preventing all of the further reasoning (leading to the contradictions) to go through.

===Benardete’s paradox===
There has been considerable interest in [[J. A. Benardete]]’s “Paradox of the Gods”:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G.R. |last=Oppy |year=2006 |title=Philosophical Perspectives on Infinity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86067-3 |lccn=2005021715 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPU9tzW-2HAC&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;pg=PA63 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|A man walks a mile from a point α. But there is an infinity of gods each of whom, unknown to the others, intends to obstruct him. One of them will raise a barrier to stop his further advance if he reaches the half-mile point, a second if he reaches the quarter-mile point, a third if he goes one-eighth of a mile, and so on ad infinitum. So he cannot even get started, because however short a distance he travels he will already have been stopped by a barrier. But in that case no barrier will rise, so that there is nothing to stop him setting off.

===Laraudogoitia’s supertask===
This supertask, proposed by [[J. P. Laraudogoitia]], is an example of [[indeterminism]] in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. The supertask consists of an infinite collection of stationary point masses. The point masses are all of mass ''m'' and are placed along a line ''AB'' that is ''a'' meters in length at positions ''B'', ''AB'' / 2, ''AB'' / 4, ''AB'' / 8, and so on. The first particle at ''B'' is accelerated to a velocity of one meter per second towards ''A''. According to the laws of Newtonian mechanics, when the first particle collides with the second, it will come to rest and the second particle will inherit its velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. This process will continue as an infinite amount of collisions, and after 1 second, all the collisions will have finished since all the particles were moving at 1 meter per second. However no particle will emerge from ''A'', since there is no last particle in the sequence. It follows that all the particles are now at rest, contradicting conservation of energy. Now the laws of Newtonian mechanics are time-reversal-invariant; that is, if we reverse the direction of time, all the laws will remain the same. If time is reversed in this supertask, we have a system of stationary point masses along ''A'' to ''AB'' / 2 that will, at random, spontaneously start colliding with each other, resulting in a particle moving away from ''B'' at a velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. Alper and Bridger have questioned the reasoning in this supertask invoking the distinction between actual and potential infinity.

===Davies' super-machine===
Proposed by [[E. B. Davies]],&lt;ref name="Davies2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = E. Brian | authorlink = E. B.

This replica will in turn create an even faster version of itself with the same specifications, resulting in a supertask that finishes after an hour. If, additionally, the machines create a communication link between parent and child machine that yields successively faster bandwidth and the machines are capable of simple arithmetic, the machines can be used to perform brute-force proofs of unknown conjectures. However, Davies also points out that{{snd}} due to fundamental properties of the real universe such as [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermal noise]] and [[information theory]]{{snd}} his machine can't actually be built.

In [[mathematics]], the '''surreal number''' system is a [[total order|totally ordered]] [[proper class]] containing the [[real number]]s as well as [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal|infinitesimal numbers]], respectively larger or smaller in [[absolute value]] than any positive real number.  The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an [[ordered field]].{{efn|In the original formulation using [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], the surreals form a proper class, rather than a set, so the term [[field (mathematics)|field]] is not precisely correct; where this distinction is important, some authors use Field or FIELD to refer to a proper class that has the arithmetic properties of a field.  One can obtain a true field by limiting the construction to a [[Grothendieck universe]], yielding a set with the cardinality of some [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]], or by using a form of set theory in which constructions by [[transfinite recursion]] stop at some countable ordinal such as [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon nought]].}} If formulated in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], the surreal numbers are a universal ordered field in the sense that all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the [[rational function]]s, the [[Levi-Civita field]], the [[superreal number]]s, and the [[hyperreal number]]s, can be realized as subfields of the surreals.&lt;ref name=bajnok&gt;{{cite book|last=Bajnok|first=Béla|title=An Invitation to Abstract Mathematics|year=2013|quote=Theorem 24.29. The surreal number system is the largest ordered field}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surreals also contain all [[transfinite number|transfinite]] [[ordinal number]]s; the arithmetic on them is given by the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural operations]]. It has also been shown (in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory) that the maximal class hyperreal field is isomorphic to the maximal class surreal field; in theories without the [[axiom of global choice]], this need not be the case, and in such theories it is not necessarily true that the surreals are a universal ordered field. 

== History of the concept ==
In 1907 [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] introduced [[Hahn series]] as a generalization of [[formal power series]], and [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] introduced certain ordered sets called [[η set|η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;-sets]] for ordinals α and asked if it was possible to find a compatible ordered group or field structure. In 1962 Alling used a modified form of Hahn series to construct such ordered fields associated to certain ordinals α, and taking α to be the class of all ordinals in his construction gives a class that is an ordered field isomorphic to the surreal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the existence of real-closed fields that are  η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;-sets of power ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

Research on the [[go (game)|go]] [[go endgame|endgame]] by [[John Horton Conway]] led to another definition and construction of the surreal numbers.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Conway.html | title = Conway Biography | last = O'Connor | first = J.J. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = E.F. | accessdate = 2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conway's construction was introduced in [[Donald Knuth]]'s 1974 book ''Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness''. In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term ''surreal numbers'' for what Conway had called simply ''numbers''.  Conway later adopted Knuth's term, and used surreals for analyzing games in his 1976 book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]''.

(Both may hold, in which case ''a'' and ''b'' are equivalent and denote the same number.)  Numbers are formed by pairing subsets of numbers already constructed:  given subsets ''L'' and ''R'' of numbers such that all the members of ''L'' are strictly less than all the members of ''R'', then the pair {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} represents a number intermediate in value between all the members of ''L'' and all the members of ''R''.

Different subsets may end up defining the same number:  {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L&amp;prime;'' | ''R&amp;prime;'' }{{nowrap end}} may define the same number even if ''L'' ≠ ''L&amp;prime;'' and ''R'' ≠ ''R&amp;prime;''.  (A similar phenomenon occurs when [[rational numbers]] are defined as quotients of integers:  1/2 and 2/4 are different representations of the same rational number.)  So strictly speaking, the surreal numbers are [[equivalence class]]es of representations of form {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}} that designate the same number.

In the first stage of construction, there are no previously existing numbers so the only representation must use the empty set:  {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}}.  This representation, where ''L'' and ''R'' are both empty, is called 0.  Subsequent stages yield forms like

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | }{{nowrap end}} = 1

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 1 | }{{nowrap end}} = 2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 2 | }{{nowrap end}} = 3

and

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | 0 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;1

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | &amp;minus;1 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ | &amp;minus;2 }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;minus;3

The integers are thus contained within the surreal numbers.  (The above identities are definitions, in the sense that the right-hand side is a name for the left-hand side. That the names are actually appropriate will be evident when the arithmetic operations on surreal numbers are defined, as in the section below). Similarly, representations such as

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1 }{{nowrap end}} = 1/2

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1/2 }{{nowrap end}} = 1/4

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 1/2 | 1 }{{nowrap end}} = 3/4

arise, so that the [[dyadic rational]]s (rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2) are contained within the surreal numbers.

After an infinite number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any [[real number]] ''a'' can be represented by {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' },{{nowrap end}}
where ''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of all dyadic rationals less than ''a'' and 
''R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than ''a'' (reminiscent of a [[Dedekind cut]]).  Thus the real numbers are also embedded within the surreals.

There are also representations like

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip; |  }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;omega;

:{{nowrap begin}}{ 0 | 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, &amp;hellip; }{{nowrap end}} = &amp;epsilon;

where ω is a transfinite number greater than all integers and ε is an infinitesimal greater than 0 but less than any positive real number.  Moreover, the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be extended to these non-real numbers in a manner that turns the collection of surreal numbers into an ordered field, so that one can talk about 2ω or ω &amp;minus; 1 and so forth.

==Construction==

Surreal numbers are [[inductive definition|constructed inductively]] as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair|pair]]s of sets of surreal numbers, restricted by the condition that each element of the first set is smaller than each element of the second set. The construction consists of three interdependent parts: the construction rule, the comparison rule and the equivalence rule.

===Forms===
A ''form'' is a pair of sets of surreal numbers, called its ''left set'' and its ''right set''. A form with left set ''L'' and right set ''R'' is written {{nowrap begin}}{ ''L'' | ''R'' }{{nowrap end}}.  When ''L'' and ''R'' are given as lists of elements, the braces around them are omitted.

Either or both of the left and right set of a form may be the empty set. The form {{nowrap begin}}{ { } | { } }{{nowrap end}} with both left and right set empty is also written {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}}.

===Numeric forms===

'''Construction Rule'''
:A form { ''L'' | ''R'' } is ''numeric'' if the intersection of ''L'' and ''R'' is the empty set and each element of ''R'' is greater than every element of ''L'', according to the [[order theory|order relation]] ≤ given by the comparison rule below.

===Equivalence classes of numeric forms===

The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a ''surreal number''. The elements of the left and right set of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of ''forms'', but of their ''equivalence classes'').

'''Equivalence Rule'''
: Two numeric forms ''x'' and ''y'' are forms of the same number (lie in the same equivalence class) if and only if both ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

An [[Order theory|ordering relationship]] must be [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], i.e., it must have the property that ''x'' = ''y'' (i. e., ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x'' are both true) only when ''x'' and ''y'' are the same object.  This is not the case for surreal number ''forms'', but is true by construction for surreal ''numbers'' (equivalence classes).

The equivalence class containing {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}} is labeled 0; in other words, {{nowrap begin}}{ | }{{nowrap end}} is a form of the surreal number 0.

===Order===

The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison:

Given numeric forms ''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } and ''y'' = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if:
*there is no ''x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''y'' ≤ ''x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' (every element in the left part of ''x'' is smaller than ''y''), and
*there is no ''y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''x'' (every element in the right part of ''y'' is bigger than ''x'').
A comparison ''y'' ≤ ''c'' between a form ''y'' and a surreal number ''c'' is performed by choosing a form ''z'' from the equivalence class ''c'' and evaluating ''y'' ≤ ''z''; and likewise for ''c'' ≤ ''x'' and for comparison ''b'' ≤ ''c'' between two surreal numbers.

===Induction===

This group of definitions is [[recursion|recursive]], and requires some form of [[mathematical induction]] to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them.  The only surreal numbers reachable via ''finite induction'' are the [[Dyadic rational|dyadic fractions]]; a wider universe is reachable given some form of [[transfinite induction]].

'''Induction Rule'''
* There is a generation ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 }, in which 0 consists of the single form { | }.
* Given any [[ordinal number]] ''n'', the generation ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all surreal numbers that are generated by the construction rule from subsets of &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i &lt; n} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the "least ordinal".  Since there exists no ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with ''i'' &lt; 0, the expression &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i &lt; 0} S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of a single surreal form { | } lying in a single equivalence class 0.

For every finite ordinal number ''n'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[well-order]]ed by the ordering induced by the comparison rule on the surreal numbers.

The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms { | 0 } &lt; { | } &lt; { 0 | } (the form  { 0 | 0 } is non-numeric because 0≤0).  The equivalence class containing { 0 | } is labeled 1 and the equivalence class containing { | 0 } is labeled −1.  These three labels have a special significance in the axioms that define a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; they are the additive identity (0), the multiplicative identity (1), and the additive inverse of 1 (−1).  The arithmetic operations defined below are consistent with these labels.

For every ''i'' &lt; ''n'', since every valid form in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a valid form in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, all of the numbers in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' also appear in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (as supersets of their representation in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').  (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form ''S&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that the definition also makes sense when ''n'' is a [[limit ordinal]].)  Numbers in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are a superset of some number in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are said to have been ''inherited'' from generation ''i''.  The smallest value of α for which a given surreal number appears in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is called its ''birthday''.  For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of −1 is 1.

A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes:

: { | −1 } = { | −1, 0 } = { | −1, 1 } = { | −1, 0, 1 }
: &lt; { | 0 } = { | 0, 1 }
: &lt; { −1 | 0 } = { −1 | 0, 1 }
: &lt; { | } = { −1 | } = { | 1 } = { −1 | 1 }
: &lt; { 0 | 1 } = { −1, 0 | 1 }
: &lt; { 0 | } = { −1, 0 | }
: &lt; { 1 | } = { 0, 1 | } = { −1, 1 | } = { −1, 0, 1 | }

Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent, irrespective of the choice of form.  Three observations follow:
# ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains four new surreal numbers.  Two contain extremal forms: { | −1, 0, 1 } contains all numbers from previous generations in its right set, and { −1, 0, 1 | } contains all numbers from previous generations in its left set.  The others have a form that partitions all numbers from previous generations into two non-empty sets.
# Every surreal number ''x'' that existed in the previous "generation" exists also in this generation, and includes at least one new form: a partition of all numbers ''other than'' ''x'' from previous generations into a left set (all numbers less than ''x'') and a right set (all numbers greater than ''x'').
# The equivalence class of a number depends only on the maximal element of its left set and the minimal element of the right set.

The informal interpretations of { 1 | } and { | −1 } are "the number just after 1" and "the number just before −1" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and −2.  The informal interpretations of { 0 | 1 } and { −1 | 0 } are "the number halfway between 0 and 1" and "the number halfway between −1 and 0" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below.

The equivalence classes at each stage ''n'' of induction may be characterized by their ''n''-''complete forms'' (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets).  Either this complete form contains ''every'' number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number.  We retain the labels from the previous generation for these "old" numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels:
: −2 &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; 2.

The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets.  (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.)  The number { 1, 2 | 5, 8 } is therefore equivalent to { 2 | 5 }; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the ''birthday property'', which is a consequence of the rules above.

'''Birthday property'''
: A form ''x'' = { ''L'' | ''R'' } occurring in generation ''n'' represents a number inherited from an earlier generation ''i'' &lt; ''n'' if and only if there is some number in ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of the ''R''.  (In other words, if ''L'' and ''R'' are already separated by a number created at an earlier stage, then ''x'' does not represent a new number but one already constructed.)  If ''x'' represents a number from any generation earlier than ''n'', there is a least such generation ''i'', and exactly one number ''c'' with this least ''i'' as its birthday lies between ''L'' and ''R''.  ''x'' is a form of this ''c'', i. e., it lies in the equivalence class in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is a superset of the representation of ''c'' in generation ''i''.

==Arithmetic==

The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number ''forms'' ''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } and ''y'' = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } are defined by three recursive formulas.

===Negation===

Negation of a given number {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' }{{nowrap end}} is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;-x = - \{ X_L | X_R \} = \{ -X_R | -X_L \}&lt;/math&gt;,
where the negation of a set ''S'' of numbers is given by the set of the negated elements of ''S'':
:&lt;math&gt;-S = \{ -s: s \in S \}&lt;/math&gt;.

This formula involves the negation of the surreal ''numbers'' appearing in the left and right sets of ''x'', which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form.  This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the operand.  This can be proven inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form ''x'' first occurs, and observing the special case:
: -0 = - { | } = { | } = 0.

===Addition===
The definition of addition is also a recursive formula:
: &lt;math&gt;x + y = \{ X_L | X_R \} + \{ Y_L | Y_R \} = \{ X_L + y, x + Y_L | X_R + y, x + Y_R \}&lt;/math&gt;,
where

:&lt;math&gt;X + y = \{ x + y: x \in X \} , x + Y = \{ x + y: y \in Y \}&lt;/math&gt;.

This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal ''number'' drawn from the left or right set of the other.  These are to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the numeric operand, performing the sum of the two forms, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form.  This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the numeric operand.  This can also be proven inductively with the special cases:
: 0 + 0 = { | } + { | } = { | } = 0
: ''x'' + 0 = x + { | } = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 0 | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 0 } = { ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''X&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = ''x''
: 0 + ''y'' = { | } + ''y'' = { 0 + ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | 0 + ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Y&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = ''y''
(The latter two cases are themselves proven inductively.)

===Multiplication===

The recursive formula for multiplication contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression &lt;math&gt;X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the left set of the product of ''x'' and ''y''.  This is to be understood as the set of surreal numbers resulting from choosing one number from each set that appears in the expression and evaluating the expression on these numbers.  (In each individual evaluation of the expression, only one number is chosen from each set, and is substituted in each place where that set appears in the expression.)

This depends, in turn, on the ability to (a) multiply pairs of surreal ''numbers'' drawn from the left and right sets of ''x'' and ''y'' to get a surreal number, and negate the result; (b) multiply the surreal number ''form'' ''x'' or ''y'' and a surreal ''number'' drawn from the left or right set of the other operand to get a surreal number; and (c) add the resulting surreal numbers.  This again involves special cases, this time containing 0 = { | }, the multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }, and its additive inverse -1 = { | 0 }.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
xy &amp; = \{ X_L | X_R \} \{ Y_L | Y_R \} \\
   &amp; = \left\{ X_L y + x Y_L - X_L Y_L, X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R | X_L y + x Y_R - X_L Y_R, x Y_L + X_R y - X_R Y_L \right\} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Division ===
The definition of division is done in terms of the reciprocal and multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\frac xy = x \left( \frac 1y \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\frac 1y = \Bigg \{0, \frac{1+(y^R-y)(\frac1y)^L}{y^R}, \frac{1+(y^L-y)(\frac1y)^R}{y^L} \Bigg | \frac{1+(y^L-y)(\frac1y)^L}{y^L}, \frac{1+(y^R-y)(\frac1y)^R}{y^R} \Bigg \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Con01" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

for positive &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Only positive &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y^L&lt;/math&gt; are permitted in the formula, with any nonpositive terms being ignored (and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y^R&lt;/math&gt; are always positive). This formula involves not only recursion in terms of being able to divide by numbers from the left and right sets of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, but also recursion in that the members of the left and right sets of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; itself. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is always a member of the left set of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt;, and that can be used to find more terms in a recursive fashion. For example, if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y = 3 = \{2|\}&lt;/math&gt;, then we know a left term of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 13&lt;/math&gt; will be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. This in turn means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)0}2=1/2&lt;/math&gt; is a right term. This means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)\left(\frac12\right)}2=\frac14&lt;/math&gt; is a left term. This means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1+(2-3)\left(\frac14\right)}2 = \frac 38&lt;/math&gt; will be a right term. Continuing, this gives &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac13 = \{0, \frac14, \frac5{16}, \ldots | \frac12, \frac38, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For negative &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac1y=-\left(\frac1{-y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\frac 1y&lt;/math&gt; is undefined.

===Consistency===

It can be shown that the definitions of negation, addition and multiplication are consistent, in the sense that:
* addition and negation are defined recursively in terms of "simpler" addition and negation steps, so that operations on numbers with birthday ''n'' will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of operations on numbers with birthdays less than ''n'';
* multiplication is defined recursively in terms of additions, negations, and "simpler" multiplication steps, so that the product of numbers with birthday ''n'' will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of sums and differences of products of numbers with birthdays less than ''n'';
* as long as the operands are well-defined surreal number forms (each element of the left set is less than each element of the right set), the results are again well-defined surreal number forms;
* the operations can be extended to ''numbers'' (equivalence classes of forms): the result of negating ''x'' or adding or multiplying ''x'' and ''y'' will represent the same number regardless of the choice of form of ''x'' and ''y''; and
* these operations obey the associativity, commutativity, additive inverse, and distributivity axioms in the definition of a [[field (mathematics)|field]], with additive identity 0 = { | } and multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }.

With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled.  The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals:

: ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { 0 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −2 &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; 2}
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −3 &lt; −2 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −1 &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2 &lt; 3 }
: ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' = { −4 &lt; −3 &lt; ... &lt; −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2 &lt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3 &lt; 4 }

===Arithmetic closure===

For each [[natural number]] (finite ordinal) ''n'', all numbers generated in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[dyadic fraction]]s, i.e., can be written as an [[irreducible fraction]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2^b}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[integer]]s and 0 ≤ ''b'' &lt; ''n''.

The set of all surreal numbers that are generated in some ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for finite ''n'' may be denoted as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\cup_{n \in N}  S_n&lt;/math&gt;.  One may form the three classes ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 }, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt; { x \in S_*: x &gt; 0 }&lt;/math&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt; { x \in S_*: x &lt; 0 }&lt;/math&gt;, of which ''S&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the union.  No individual ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is closed under addition and multiplication (except ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), but ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions.

There are infinite ordinal numbers β for which the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than β is closed under the different arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name=vdDE2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van den Dries | first1 = Lou | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = Philip | author2-link = Philip Ehrlich | title = Fields of surreal numbers and exponentiation | journal =  Fundamenta Mathematicae | volume = 167 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–188 | publisher = Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences | location = Warszawa | date = January 2001 | url = http://www.ohio.edu/people/ehrlich/EhrlichvandenDries.pdf | issn = 0016-2736 | doi = 10.4064/fm167-2-3 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161021010354/http://www.ohio.edu/people/ehrlich/EhrlichvandenDries.pdf | archivedate = 2016-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For any ordinal α, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than β = ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; (using [[#Powers of ω|powers of ω]]) is closed under addition and forms a group; for birthday less than ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it is closed under multiplication and forms a ring;{{efn|1=The set of dyadic fractions constitutes the simplest non-trivial group and ring of this kind; it consists of the surreal numbers with birthday less than ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.}} and for birthday less than an (ordinal) [[Epsilon number (mathematics)|epsilon number]] ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; it is closed under multiplicative inverse and forms a field.

However, it is always possible to construct a surreal number that is greater than any member of a set (by including the set on the left side of the constructor) and thus the collection of surreal numbers is a proper [[mathematical class|class]]. With their ordering and algebraic operations they constitute an [[ordered field]], with the caveat that they do not form a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].  In fact, it is a very special ordered field: the biggest one.  Every other ordered field can be embedded in the surreals. The class of all surreal numbers is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Infinity ==

Define ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of ''S&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''.  (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number ω is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can only be performed in a set theory that allows such a union.)  A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;  \omega = \{ S_* | \} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | \}. &lt;/math&gt;
''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; also contains objects that can be identified as the [[rational number]]s.  For example, the ω-complete form of the fraction &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
: &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1} {3} = \{ y \in S_*: 3 y &lt; 1 | y \in S_*: 3 y &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
The product of this form of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1.

Not only do all the rest of the [[rational number]]s appear in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;; the remaining finite [[real number]]s do too.  For example,
: &lt;math&gt; \pi = \{ 3, \frac{25}{8},\frac{201}{64}, ... | 4, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{13}{4}, \frac{51}{16},... \}&lt;/math&gt;.

The only infinities in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are ω and −ω; but there are other non-real numbers in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; among the reals.  Consider the smallest positive number in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \{ S_- \cup S_0 | S_+ \} = \{ 0 | 1, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{8}, ... \} = \{ 0 | y \in S_* : y &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an [[infinitesimal]] number, often labeled ε.  The ω-complete form of ε (resp. -ε) is the same as the ω-complete form of 0, except that 0 is included in the left (resp. right) set.  The only "pure" infinitesimals in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are ε and its additive inverse -ε; adding them to any dyadic fraction ''y'' produces the numbers ''y''±ε, which also lie in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.

One can determine the relationship between ω and ε by multiplying particular forms of them to obtain:
: ω · ε = { ε · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; | ω · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; + ε · ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; }.
This expression is only well-defined in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to &lt;math&gt;S_{\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of ω · ε are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore ω · ε is the oldest positive finite number, i. e., 1.  Consequently,
: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; = ω.
Some authors systematically use ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in place of the symbol ε.

===Contents of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;===

Given any ''x'' = { ''L'' | ''R'' } in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, exactly one of the following is true:
* ''L'' and ''R'' are both empty, in which case ''x'' = 0;
* ''R'' is empty and some integer ''n''≥0 is greater than every element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' equals the smallest such integer ''n'';
* ''R'' is empty and no integer ''n'' is greater than every element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' equals +ω;
* ''L'' is empty and some integer ''n''≤0 is less than every element of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals the largest such integer ''n'';
* ''L'' is empty and no integer ''n'' is less than every element of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals -ω;
* ''L'' and ''R'' are both non-empty, and:
** some dyadic fraction ''y'' is "strictly between" ''L'' and ''R'' (greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of ''R''), in which case ''x'' equals the oldest such dyadic fraction ''y'';
** no dyadic fraction ''y'' lies strictly between ''L'' and ''R'', but some dyadic fraction &lt;math&gt; y \in L&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to all elements of ''L'' and less than all elements of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals ''y''+ε;
** no dyadic fraction ''y'' lies strictly between ''L'' and ''R'', but some dyadic fraction &lt;math&gt; y \in R&lt;/math&gt; is greater than all elements of ''L'' and less than or equal to all elements of ''R'', in which case ''x'' equals ''y''-ε;
** every dyadic fraction is either greater than some element of ''R'' or less than some element of ''L'', in which case ''x'' is some real number that has no representation as a dyadic fraction.

''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is not an algebraic field, because it is not closed under arithmetic operations; consider ω+1, whose form &lt;math&gt; \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | \} + \{ 0 | \} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., \omega | \}&lt;/math&gt; does not lie in any number in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.  The maximal subset of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; that is closed under (finite series of) arithmetic operations is the field of real numbers, obtained by leaving out the infinities ±ω, the infinitesimals ±ε, and the infinitesimal neighbors ''y''±ε of each nonzero dyadic fraction ''y''.

This construction of the real numbers differs from the [[Dedekind cut]]s of [[standard analysis]] in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; with its forms in previous generations.  (The ω-complete forms of real elements of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the reals obtained by Dedekind cuts, under the proviso that Dedekind reals corresponding to rational numbers are represented by the form in which the cut point is omitted from both left and right sets.)  The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the surreal construction; they are merely the subset ''Q'' of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; containing all elements ''x'' such that ''x'' ''b'' = ''a'' for some ''a'' and some nonzero ''b'', both drawn from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;.  By demonstrating that ''Q'' is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of ''Q'' is reachable from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; by a finite series (no longer than two, actually) of arithmetic operations ''including multiplicative inversion'', one can show that ''Q'' is strictly smaller than the subset of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; identified with the reals.

The set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; has the same [[cardinality]] as the real numbers ''R''.  This can be demonstrated by exhibiting surjective mappings from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; to the closed unit interval ''I'' of ''R'' and vice versa.  Mapping ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''I'' is routine; map numbers less than or equal to ε (including -ω) to 0, numbers greater than or equal to 1-ε (including ω) to 1, and numbers between ε and 1-ε to their equivalent in ''I'' (mapping the infinitesimal neighbors ''y''±ε of each dyadic fraction ''y'', along with ''y'' itself, to ''y'').  To map ''I'' onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, map the (open) central third (1/3, 2/3) of ''I'' onto { | } = 0; the central third (7/9, 8/9) of the upper third to { 0 | } = 1; and so forth.  This maps a nonempty open interval of ''I'' onto each element of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, monotonically.  The residue of ''I'' consists of the [[Cantor set]] ''2''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, each point of which is uniquely identified by a partition of the central-third intervals into left and right sets, corresponding precisely to a form { ''L'' | ''R'' } in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.  This places the Cantor set in one-to-one correspondence with the set of surreal numbers with birthday ω.

== Transfinite induction ==

Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond ''S''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; produces more ordinal numbers α, each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday α.  (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.)  The first such ordinal is ω+1 = { ω | }.  There is another positive infinite number in generation ω+1:
: ω−1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | ω }.
It is important to observe that the surreal number ω−1 is not an ordinal; the ordinal ω is not the successor of any ordinal.  This is a surreal number with birthday ω+1, which is labeled ω−1 on the basis that it coincides with the sum of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and −1 = { | 0 }.  Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation ω+1:
: 2ε = ε + ε = { ε | 1+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;+ε, ... } and
: ε/2 = ε · &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { 0 | ε }.

At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than ω+''k'' for all natural numbers ''k'':
: 2ω = ω + ω = { ω+1, ω+2, ω+3, ω+4, ... | }
This number may be labeled ω + ω both because its birthday is ω + ω (the first ordinal number not reachable from ω by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of ω and ω; it may also be labeled 2ω because it coincides with the product of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and 2 = { 1 | }.  It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from ω via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{k &lt; \omega} S_{\omega + k}&lt;/math&gt;.  This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a "stronger" set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required.

Note that the ''conventional'' addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations.  The sum of ordinals 1 + ω equals ω, but the surreal sum is commutative and produces 1 + ω = ω + 1 &gt; ω.  The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]] of ordinals.

Just as 2ω is bigger than ω + ''n'' for any natural number ''n'', there is a surreal number ω/2 that is infinite but smaller than ω − ''n'' for any natural number ''n''.  That is, ω/2 is defined by
: ω/2 = { ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; | ω − ''S''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; }
where on the right hand side the notation ''x'' − ''Y'' is used to mean { ''x'' − ''y'' : ''y'' in ''Y'' }.  It can be identified as the product of ω and the form { 0 | 1 } of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The birthday of &lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the limit ordinal ω2.

== Powers of ω ==

To classify the "orders" of infinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers, also known as [[archimedean property|archimedean]] classes, Conway associated to each surreal number ''x'' the surreal number
* ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = { 0, ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; | ''s'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; },
where ''r'' and ''s'' range over the positive real numbers.  If ''x'' &lt; ''y'' then ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; is "infinitely greater" than ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, in that it is greater than ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for all real numbers ''r''.  Powers of ω also satisfy the conditions
* ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;''x+y''&lt;/sup&gt;,
* ω&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;,
so they behave the way one would expect powers to behave.

Each power of ω also has the redeeming feature of being the ''simplest'' surreal number in its archimedean class; conversely, every archimedean class within the surreal numbers contains a unique simplest member.  Thus, for every positive surreal number ''x'' there will always exist some positive real number ''r'' and some surreal number ''y'' so that ''x'' − ''r'' ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; is "infinitely smaller" than ''x''.  The exponent ''y'' is the "base ω logarithm" of ''x'', defined on the positive surreals; it can be demonstrated that log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; maps the positive surreals onto the surreals and that log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''xy'') = log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') + log&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'').

This gets extended by transfinite induction so that every surreal number ''x'' has a "normal form" analogous to the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] for ordinal numbers.  Every surreal number may be uniquely written as
* ''x'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + …,
where every ''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a nonzero real number and the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;s form a strictly decreasing sequence of surreal numbers.  This "sum", however, may have infinitely many terms, and in general has the length of an arbitrary ordinal number. (Zero corresponds of course to the case of an empty sequence, and is the only surreal number with no leading exponent.)

Looked at in this manner, the surreal numbers resemble a [[Formal power series|power series field]], except that the decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and are not allowed to be as long as the class of ordinals. This is the basis for the formulation of the surreal numbers as a [[#Hahn series|Hahn series]].

==Gaps and continuity==

In contrast to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of the surreal numbers does not have a least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines&lt;ref name=Con01/&gt; a gap as {''L'' | ''R''}, ''L'' &lt; ''R'', ''L'' ∪ ''R'' = 𝐍𝐨; this is not a number because at least one of the sides is a proper class. Though similar, gaps are not quite the same as [[Dedekind cut|Dedekind sections]]{{efn|The definition of a gap omits the conditions of a Dedekind cut that ''L'' and ''R'' be non-empty and that ''L'' not have a largest element, and also the identification of a cut with the smallest element in ''R'' if one exists.}}, but we can still talk about a completion 𝐍𝐨&lt;sup&gt;𝕯&lt;/sup&gt; of the surreal numbers with the natural ordering which is a (proper class-sized) [[linear continuum]].&lt;ref name=RSS15&gt;{{cite arXiv|first1=Simon|last1=Rubinstein-Salzedo|first2=Ashvin|last2=Swaminathan|arxiv=1307.7392v3|class=math.CA|date=2015-05-19|title=Analysis on Surreal Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance there is no least positive infinite surreal, but the gap ∞ = {''x'': ∃ ''n'' ∈ ℕ: ''x'' &lt; ''n'' | ''x'': ∀ ''n'' ∈ ℕ: ''x'' &gt; ''n''} is greater than all real numbers and less than all positive infinite surreals, and is thus the least upper bound of the reals in 𝐍𝐨&lt;sup&gt;𝕯&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly the gap 𝐎𝐧 = { 𝐍𝐨 | } is larger than all surreal numbers. (𝐎𝐧 is also the name of the class of ordinal numbers, and since 𝐎𝐧 is [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in 𝐍𝐨 and thus 𝐎𝐧 = { 𝐎𝐧 | } as well, this extends the equivalence of an ordinal α with the set of ordinals smaller than α).

With a bit of set-theoretic care&lt;ref name=RSS15/&gt;{{efn|Importantly there is no claim that the collection of Cauchy sequences constitutes a class in NBG set theory.}} 𝐍𝐨 can be equipped with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences can be defined as well although they have to be indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap that can be expressed as ∑&lt;sub&gt;α∈𝐍𝐨&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with
''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; decreasing and having no lower bound in 𝐍𝐨. (All such gaps can be understood as Cauchy sequences themselves but there are other types of gap that are not limits, such as ∞ and 𝐎𝐧).

==Exponential function==
Based on unpublished work by [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]], a construction (by transfinite induction) that extends the real [[exponential function]] exp(''x'') (with base ''e'') to the surreals was carried through by Gonshor.&lt;ref name=G1986 /&gt;{{rp|at=ch. 10}}

===Other exponentials===
The [[#Powers of ω|powers of ω]] function is also an exponential function, but does not have the properties desired for an extension of the function on the reals. It will, however, be needed in the development of the base-''e'' exponential, and it is this function that is meant whenever the notation ω&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is used in the following.

When ''y'' is a dyadic fraction, the [[power function]] {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ No}}, {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may be composed from multiplication, multiplicative inverse and square root, all of which can be defined inductively. Its values are completely determined by the basic relation {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;y+z&lt;/sup&gt; = x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;·x&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;'',}} and where defined it necessarily agrees with any other [[exponentiation]] that can exist.

===Basic induction===
The induction steps for the surreal exponential are based on the series expansion for the real exponential, {{nowrap|1=exp ''x'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/n!,}} more specifically those partial sums that can be shown by basic algebra to be positive but less than all later ones. For ''x'' positive these are denoted [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and include all partial sums; for ''x'' negative but finite, [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the odd steps in the series starting from the first one with a positive real part (which always exists). For ''x'' negative infinite the odd-numbered partial sums are strictly decreasing and the [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; notation denotes the empty set, but it turns out that the corresponding elements are not needed in the induction.

The relations that hold for real
{{nowrap|1=''x'' &lt; ''y''}}
are then
{{nowrap|1=exp ''x'' · [''y–x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; exp ''y''}}
and
{{nowrap|1=exp ''y'' · [''x–y'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; exp ''x'',}}
and this can be extended to the surreals with the definition 
{{nowrap|1=exp ''z'' = { 0,
exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' · [''z–z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' · [''z–z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{pipe}}
exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' / [''z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;–z'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; , exp ''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' / [''z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;–z'']&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; }.}} This is well-defined for all surreal arguments (the value exists and does not depend on the choice of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;).
===Results===
Using this definition, the following holds:{{efn|Even the most trivial-looking of these equalities may involve transfinite induction and constitute a  separate theorem.}}
* exp is a strictly increasing positive function, {{nowrap|1=''x'' &lt; ''y'' ⇒ 0 &lt; exp ''x'' &lt; exp ''y''}}
* exp satisfies {{nowrap|1=exp(''x''+''y'') = exp ''x'' · exp ''y''}}
* exp is a surjection (onto '''No'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) and has a well-defined inverse, {{nowrap|1=log = exp&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}
* exp coincides with the usual exponential function on the reals (and thus {{nowrap|1=exp 0 = 1, exp 1 = ''e''}})
* For ''x'' infinitesimal, the value of the formal power series {{nowrap|1=∑&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''n''!}} is well defined and coincides with the inductive definition
** When ''x'' is given in Conway normal form, the set of exponents in the result is well-ordered and the coefficients are finite sums, directly giving the normal form of the result (which has a leading 1)
** Similarly, for ''x'' infinitesimally close to 1, log ''x'' is given by power series expansion of {{nowrap|''x''–1}}
* For positive infinite ''x'', exp ''x'' is infinite as well
** If ''x'' has the form ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; (α &gt; 0), exp ''x'' has the form ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where β is a strictly increasing function of α. In fact there is an inductively defined bijection {{nowrap|1=''g'': '''No'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; → '''No''': α ↦ β}} whose inverse can also be defined inductively

* Any surreal number can be written as the sum of a pure infinite, a real and an infinitesimal part, and the exponential is the product of the partial results given above
** The normal form can be written out by multiplying the infinite part (a single power of ω) and the real exponential into the power series resulting from the infinitesimal
** Conversely, dividing out the leading term of the normal form will bring any surreal number into the form {{nowrap|1=(ω&lt;sup&gt;∑&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;δ&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)·''r''·(1 + ∑&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, for {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}, where each factor has a form for which a way of calculating the logarithm has been given above; the sum is then the general logarithm
*** While there is no general inductive definition of log (unlike for exp), the partial results are given in terms of such definitions. In this way, the logarithm can be calculated explicitly, without reference to the fact that it's the inverse of the exponential.
* The exponential function is much greater than any finite power
** For any positive infinite ''x'' and any finite ''n'', exp(''x'')/''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is infinite
** For any integer ''n'' and surreal ''x'' &amp;gt; ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, exp(''x'') &amp;gt; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This stronger constraint is one of the Ressayre axioms for the real [[exponential field]]&lt;ref name=vdDE2001 /&gt;
* exp satisfies all the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field&lt;ref name=vdDE2001 /&gt;
** The surreals with exponential is an [[elementary extension]] of the real exponential field
** For ε&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; an ordinal epsilon number, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than ε&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; constitute a field that is closed under exponentials, and is likewise an elementary extension of the real exponential field

===Examples===
The surreal exponential is essentially given by its behaviour on positive powers of ω, i.e., the function ''g(a)'', combined with well-known behaviour on finite numbers. Only examples of the former will be given. In addition, {{nowrap|1=''g(a)'' = ''a''}} holds for a large part of its range, for instance for any finite number with positive real part and any infinite number that is less than some iterated power of ω ({{nowrap|ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;·&lt;sup&gt;·&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some number of levels).
* exp ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;
* exp ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt; = ω and log ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt;
* exp (ω · log ω) = exp (ω · ω&lt;sup&gt;1/ω&lt;/sup&gt;) = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;(1 + 1/ω)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
** This shows that the "power of ω" function is not compatible with exp, since compatibility would demand a value of ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; here
* exp ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
* log ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =  ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; / ω

===Exponentiation===
A general exponentiation can be defined as {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;'' = exp(''y'' · log ''x'')}}, giving an interpretation to expressions like {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = exp(ω · log 2) = ω&lt;sup&gt;log 2 · ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Again it is essential to distinguish this definition from the "powers of ω" function, especially if ω may occur as the base.

== Surcomplex numbers ==

A '''surcomplex number''' is a number of the form {{math|''a+bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are surreal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamespropp.org/surreal/text.ps.gz Surreal vectors and the game of Cutblock], James Propp, August 22, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alling"&gt;{{cite book | last = Alling | first = Norman L. | title = Foundations of Analysis over Surreal Number Fields | publisher = North-Holland | series = Mathematics Studies 141 | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-444-70226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surcomplex numbers form an [[algebraically closed]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] (except for being a proper class), [[isomorphic (mathematics)|isomorphic]] to the [[algebraic closure]] of the field generated by extending the [[rational numbers]] by a [[proper class]] of [[algebraically independent]] [[transcendental (mathematics)|transcendental]] elements.  Up to field [[isomorphism]], this fact characterizes the field of surcomplex numbers within any fixed set theory.&lt;ref name=Con01/&gt;{{rp|Th.27}}

==Games==
{{main article|combinatorial game theory}}

The definition of surreal numbers contained one restriction: each element of L must be strictly less than each element of R.  If this restriction is dropped we can generate a more general class known as ''games''.  All games are constructed according to this rule:

:'''Construction Rule'''&lt;br/&gt; If ''L'' and ''R'' are two sets of games then { ''L'' | ''R'' } is a game.

Addition, negation, and comparison are all defined the same way for both surreal numbers and games.

Every surreal number is a game, but not all games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game [[star (game theory)|{ '''0''' | '''0''' }]] is not a surreal number.  The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer properties of surreal numbers.  The class of surreal numbers forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]], but the class of games does not.  The surreals have a [[total order]]: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one is greater than the other.  The games have only a [[partial order]]: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other.  Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero.  Each game is either positive, negative, ''[[zero game|zero]]'', or ''[[fuzzy game|fuzzy]]'' (incomparable with zero, such as {1|−1}).

A move in a game involves the player whose move it is choosing a game from those available in L (for the left player) or R (for the right player) and then passing this chosen game to the other player.  A player who cannot move because the choice is from the empty set has lost. A positive game represents a win for the left player, a negative game for the right player, a zero game for the second player to move, and a [[fuzzy game]] for the first player to move.

If ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are surreals, and ''x''=''y'', then ''x'' ''z''=''y'' ''z''.  However, if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are games, and ''x''=''y'', then it is not always true that ''x'' ''z''=''y'' ''z''.  Note that "=" here means equality, not identity.

==Application to combinatorial game theory==

The surreal numbers were originally motivated by studies of the game [[Go (board game)|Go]],&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; and there are numerous connections between popular games and the surreals.  In this section, we will use a capitalized ''Game'' for the mathematical object {L|R}, and the lowercase ''game'' for recreational games like [[Chess]] or [[Go (board game)|Go]].

We consider games with these properties:
* Two players (named ''Left'' and ''Right'')
* [[Deterministic]] (the game at each step will completely depend on the choices the players make, rather than a random factor)
* No hidden information (such as cards or tiles that a player hides)
* Players alternate taking turns (the game may or may not allow multiple moves in a turn)
* Every game must end in a finite number of moves
* As soon as there are no legal moves left for a player, the game ends, and that player loses

For most games, the initial board position gives no great advantage to either player.  As the game progresses and one player starts to win, board positions will occur in which that player has a clear advantage.  For analyzing games, it is useful to associate a Game with every board position.  The value of a given position will be the Game {L|R}, where L is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Left. Similarly, R is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Right.

The zero Game (called 0) is the Game where L and R are both empty, so the player to move next (L or R) immediately loses. The sum of two Games G = { L1 | R1 } and H = { L2 | R2 } is defined as the Game G + H = { L1 + H, G + L2 | R1 + H, G + R2 } where the player to move chooses which of the Games to play in at each stage, and the loser is still the player who ends up with no legal move. One can imagine two chess boards between two players, with players making moves alternatively, but with complete freedom as to which board to play on. If G is the Game {L | R}, -G is the game {-R | -L}, i.e. with the role of the two players reversed. It is easy to show G - G = 0 for all Games G (where G -  H is defined as G + (-H)).

This simple way to associate Games with games yields a very interesting result.  Suppose two perfect players play a game starting with a given position whose associated Game is ''x''.  We can classify all Games into four classes as follows:

* If x &gt; 0 then Left will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If x &lt; 0 then Right will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If x = 0 then the player who goes second will win.
* If x || 0 then the player who goes first will win.

More generally, we can define G &gt; H as G - H &gt; 0, and similarly for &lt;, = and ||.

The notation G || H means that G and H are incomparable.  G || H is equivalent to G−H || 0, i.e. that G &gt; H, G &lt; H and G = H are all false.   Incomparable games are sometimes said to be ''confused'' with each other, because one or the other may be preferred by a player depending on what is added to it.  A game confused with zero is said to be [[fuzzy game|fuzzy]], as opposed to [[sign (mathematics)|positive, negative, or zero]]. An example of a fuzzy game is [[star (game theory)|star (*)]].

Sometimes when a game nears the end, it will decompose into several smaller games that do not interact, except in that each player's turn allows moving in only one of them.  For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until there are just a few small islands of empty space where a player can move.  Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board.  It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give an analysis of the entire game.  This doesn't appear to be easy to do.  For example, you might have two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it's no longer the first player who wins.  Fortunately, there is a way to do this analysis.  Just use the following remarkable theorem:

:If a big game decomposes into two smaller games, and the small games have associated Games of ''x'' and ''y'', then the big game will have an associated Game of ''x''+''y''.

A game composed of smaller games is called the [[disjunctive sum]] of those smaller games, and the theorem states that the method of addition we defined is equivalent to taking the disjunctive sum of the addends.

Historically, Conway developed the theory of surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here.  He was analyzing [[Go terms#Yose|Go endgames]], and realized that it would be useful to have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their [[disjunctive sum]].  From this he invented the concept of a Game and the addition operator for it.  From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison.  Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers.  Finally, he developed the multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals.

==Alternative realizations==

The name surreal number was first used by Conway in 1972, but there are several alternative constructions developed both before and after that.

===Sign expansion===

====Definitions====

In what is now called the ''sign-expansion'' or ''sign-sequence'' of a surreal number, a surreal number is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] and whose [[codomain]] is { −1, +1 }.&lt;ref name=G1986 /&gt;{{rp|at=ch. 2}} This is equivalent to Conway's L-R sequences.&lt;ref name="Con01" /&gt;

Define the binary predicate "simpler than" on numbers by ''x'' is simpler than ''y'' if ''x'' is a [[subset|proper subset]] of ''y'', ''i.e.'' if dom(''x'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') and ''x''(α) = ''y''(α) for all α &amp;lt; dom(''x'').

For surreal numbers  define the binary relation &amp;lt; to be lexicographic order (with the convention that "undefined values" are greater than &amp;minus;1 and less than 1). So ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' if one of the following holds:
* ''x'' is simpler than ''y'' and ''y''(dom(''x'')) = + 1;
* ''y'' is simpler than ''x'' and ''x''(dom(''y'')) = − 1;
* there exists a number ''z'' such that ''z'' is simpler than ''x'', ''z'' is simpler than ''y'', ''x''(dom(''z'')) = − 1 and ''y''(dom(''z'')) = + 1.

Equivalently, let δ(''x'',''y'') = min({ dom(''x''), dom(''y'')} ∪ { α :
α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ α &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(α) ≠ ''y''(α) }),
so that ''x'' = ''y'' if and only if δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''x'') = dom(''y'').  Then, for numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' if and only if one of the following holds:
* δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''y''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = + 1;
* δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') = dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = − 1;
* δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ δ(''x'',''y'') &amp;lt; dom(''y'') ∧ ''x''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = − 1 ∧ ''y''(δ(''x'',''y'')) = + 1.

For numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' ∨ ''x'' = ''y'', and ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'' if and only if ''y'' &amp;lt; ''x''. Also ''x'' ≥ ''y'' if and only if ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

The relation &amp;lt; is [[transitive relation|transitive]], and for all numbers ''x'' and ''y'', exactly one of ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'', ''x'' = ''y'', ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'', holds (law of [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]]).  This means that &amp;lt; is a [[linear order]] (except that &amp;lt; is a proper class).

For sets of numbers, ''L'' and ''R'' such that ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''), there exists a unique number ''z'' such that
* ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'') ∧ ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''z'' &amp;lt; ''y''),
* For any number ''w'' such that ∀''x'' ∈ ''L'' (''x'' &amp;lt; ''w'') ∧ ∀''y'' ∈ ''R'' (''w'' &amp;lt; ''y''), ''w'' = ''z'' or ''z'' is simpler than ''w''.

Furthermore, ''z'' is constructible from ''L'' and ''R'' by transfinite induction.  ''z'' is the simplest number between ''L'' and ''R''.  Let the unique number ''z'' be denoted by σ(''L'',''R'').

For a number ''x'', define its left set ''L''(''x'') and right set ''R''(''x'') by
* ''L''(''x'') = { ''x''|&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ ''x''(α) = + 1 };
* ''R''(''x'') = { ''x''|&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : α &amp;lt; dom(''x'') ∧ ''x''(α) = − 1 },

then σ(''L''(''x''),''R''(''x'')) = ''x''.

One advantage of this alternative realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway's realization of the surreal numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway's realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals.

However, similar definitions can be made that eliminate the need for prior construction of the ordinals.  For instance, we could let the surreals be the (recursively-defined) class of functions whose domain is a subset of the surreals satisfying the transitivity rule ∀''g'' ∈ dom ''f''  (∀''h'' ∈ dom ''g'' (''h'' ∈ dom ''f'' )) and whose range is { −, + }.  "Simpler than" is very simply defined now&amp;mdash;''x'' is simpler than ''y''  if ''x'' ∈ dom ''y''.  The total ordering is defined by considering ''x'' and ''y'' as sets of ordered pairs (as a function is normally defined):  Either ''x'' = ''y'',  or else the surreal number ''z'' = ''x'' ∩ ''y''  is in the domain of ''x''  or the domain of ''y''  (or both, but in this case the signs must disagree).  We then have ''x'' &lt; ''y''  if ''x''(''z'') = − or ''y''(''z'') = + (or both).  Converting these functions into sign sequences is a straightforward task; arrange the elements of dom ''f''  in order of simplicity (i.e., inclusion), and then write down the signs that ''f'' assigns to each of these elements in order.  The ordinals then occur naturally as those surreal numbers whose range is { + }.

====Addition and multiplication====

The sum ''x'' + ''y'' of two numbers, ''x'' and ''y'', is defined by induction on dom(''x'') and dom(''y'') by ''x'' + ''y'' = σ(''L'',''R''), where
* ''L'' = { ''u'' + ''y'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x'') } ∪{ ''x'' + ''v'' : ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') },
* ''R'' = { ''u'' + ''y'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x'') } ∪{ ''x'' + ''v'' : ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') }.

The additive identity is given by the number 0 = { }, ''i.e.'' the number 0 is the unique function whose domain is the ordinal 0, and the additive inverse of the number ''x'' is the number − ''x'', given by dom(− ''x'') = dom(''x''), and, for α &amp;lt; dom(''x''), (− ''x'')(α) = − 1 if ''x''(α) = + 1, and (− ''x'')(α) = + 1 if ''x''(α) = − 1.

It follows that a number ''x'' is [[Positive number|positive]] if and only if 0 &amp;lt; dom(''x'') and ''x''(0) = + 1, and ''x'' is [[negative number|negative]] if and only if 0 &amp;lt; dom(''x'') and ''x''(0) = − 1.

The product ''xy'' of two numbers, ''x'' and ''y'', is defined by induction on dom(''x'') and dom(''y'') by ''xy'' = σ(''L'',''R''), where
* ''L'' = { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') } ∪ { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') },
* ''R'' = { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''L''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''R''(''y'') } ∪ { ''uy'' + ''xv'' − ''uv'' : ''u'' ∈ ''R''(''x''), ''v'' ∈ ''L''(''y'') }.

The multiplicative identity is given by the number 1 = { (0,+ 1) }, ''i.e.'' the number 1 has domain equal to the ordinal 1, and 1(0) = + 1.

====Correspondence with Conway====

The map from Conway's realization to sign expansions is given by ''f''({ ''L'' | ''R'' }) = σ(''M'',''S''), where ''M'' = { ''f''(''x'') : ''x'' ∈ ''L'' } and ''S'' = { ''f''(''x'') : ''x'' ∈ ''R'' }.

The inverse map from the alternative realization to Conway's realization is given by ''g''(''x'') = { ''L'' | ''R'' }, where ''L'' = { ''g''(''y'') : ''y'' ∈ ''L''(''x'') } and ''R'' = { ''g''(''y'') : ''y'' ∈ ''R''(''x'') }.

===Axiomatic approach===

In another approach to the surreals, given by Alling,&lt;ref name="Alling" /&gt;  explicit construction is bypassed altogether. Instead, a set of axioms is given that any particular approach to the surreals must satisfy. Much like the [[Real numbers#Axiomatic approach|axiomatic approach]] to the reals, these axioms guarantee uniqueness up to isomorphism.

A triple &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{No}, \mathrm{&lt;}, b \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a surreal number system if and only if the following hold:

* &lt; is a [[total order]] over '''No'''
* ''b'' is a function from '''No''' onto the class of all ordinals (''b'' is called the "birthday function" on '''No''').
* Let ''A'' and ''B'' be subclasses of '''No''' such that for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''B'', ''x'' &lt; ''y'' (using Alling's terminology, 〈 ''A'',''B'' 〉 is a "Conway cut" of '''No'''). Then there exists a unique ''z'' ∈ '''No''' such that ''b(z)'' is minimal and for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and all ''y'' ∈ ''B'', ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. (This axiom is often referred to as "Conway's Simplicity Theorem".)
* Furthermore, if an ordinal ''α'' is greater than ''b(x)'' for all ''x'' ∈ ''A'', ''B'', then ''b(z)'' ≤ ''α''. (Alling calls a system that satisfies this axiom a "full surreal number system".)

Both Conway's original construction and the sign-expansion construction of surreals satisfy these axioms.

Given these axioms, Alling&lt;ref name="Alling"/&gt; derives Conway's original definition of ≤ and develops surreal arithmetic.

===Simplicity hierarchy===

A construction of the surreal numbers as a maximal binary pseudo-tree with simplicity (ancestor) and ordering relations is due to [[Philip Ehrlich]],&lt;ref name="Ehr12"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference from the usual definition of a tree is that the set of ancestors of a vertex is well-ordered, but may not have a maximal element (immediate predecessor); in other words the order type of that set is a general ordinal number, not just a natural number. This construction fulfills Alling's axioms as well and can easily be mapped to the sign-sequence representation.

===Hahn series===

Alling&lt;ref name="Alling" /&gt;{{rp|at=th. 6.55, p. 246}} also proves that the field of surreal numbers is isomorphic (as an ordered field) to the field of [[Hahn series]] with real coefficients on the value group of surreal numbers themselves (the series representation corresponding to the normal form of a surreal number, as defined above).  This provides a connection between surreal numbers and more conventional mathematical approaches to ordered field theory.

This isomorphism makes the surreal numbers into a valued field where the valuation is the additive inverse of the exponent of the leading term in the Conway normal form, e.g., ν(ω) = -1. The valuation ring then consists of the finite surreal numbers (numbers with a real and/or an infinitesimal part). The reason for the sign inversion is that the exponents in the Conway normal form constitute a reverse well-ordered set, whereas Hahn series are formulated in terms of (non-reversed) well-ordered subsets of the value group.

==Relation to hyperreals==
Philip Ehrlich has constructed an isomorphism between Conway's maximal surreal number field and the maximal [[hyperreal field|hyperreals]] in [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].&lt;ref name="Ehr12" /&gt;

==History==
The Taos Institute was founded in 1991 by a group of scholars and practitioners interested in [[social constructionism|social constructionist]] ideas. The founders included [[Harlene Anderson]], [[David Cooperrider]], [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], [[Sheila McNamee]], [[Suresh Srivastva]], and [[Diana Whitney]]. Primary attention was focused at that time on [[organizational development]] and [[family therapy]], with practices of [[appreciative inquiry]] and co-constructive practices of therapy prevailing. Most of the founders remain on the executive board, but have since been joined by Dawn Dole, Robert Cottor, Sally St. George, Jane Magruder Watkins, and Dan Wulff. The institute currently functions as a virtual centered organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Taos Institute|title=Institute Officers and Board of Directors|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/institute-officers-and-board-of-directors|website=The Taos Institute|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Institute was derived, in part, from the fact that one of its founders, Diana Whitney, lived in [[Taos, New Mexico]], and provided a geographic center for possible meetings. In 1993, the Institute held its first international conference in Taos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Taos Institute|title=Brief History|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/brief-history|website=The Taos Insititute|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">In Scotland a '''teind'''  was a [[tithe]] derived from the produce of the land for the maintenance of the [[clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Nuttall|inline=1|title=Teinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also an old lowland term for a tribute due to be paid by the fairies to the devil every seven years. It is known for the devil to give bad luck in the world and the fary to be wiser and grant good luck and a just future. Found in the story of Tam Lin as well as in the ballad of Thomas the Rhymer.

Teind is a [[Scots Language|Scots]]  word for tithe, meaning a tenth part.

'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter. [[Occultism|Occult science]] know about the existence of higher types of rarefied matter. Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate—thought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second one—three types of "anger," on the third one—three types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth one—thought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blue—in the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (black—in the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling – they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|Писарева|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|Писарева|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

=== Created by emotions ===
[[File:Form13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. Grasping Animal Affection.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} "Thoughts of a greedy, lustful, or malicious character appear differently from those of a noble, selfless, loving nature."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thoughts in which selfishness or greed are prominent usually take a hooked form, the hooks in some case actually clawing round the object desired."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=56}} Leadbeater has compared similar thought-forms with the "[[grappling hook]]s."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 8}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Fig. 13 shows the thought-form created by "a strong craving for personal possession." Its color has dull unpleasing hue "deadened with the heavy tint indicative of selfishness." The curving hooks are its especially characteristic. Creator this thought-form had never "conception of the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service," no thinking of return.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett saw here only the "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} An especially powerful class of this kind of thought-forms takes on "the appearance of a nebulous octopus, with long, winding, clinging tentacles, striving to wrap around the other person," and to drag him toward the aura of creator.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=33}}}}{{refn|group=note|"A gross sensual love will be a dull and heavy crimson"... The mutual influence of thoughts is like "adding fuel to the fire." If someone for a long time is fraught with low thoughts, then into his mind will pour such a vicious stream that he will be horrified if he understands what he is doing with himself.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=65, 84}} According to Leadbeater, do not need to collect photos of actresses [and actors], as "they always attract the most undesirable thought-forms from hosts of impure-minded people."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}
[[File:Form19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. The Intention to Know.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=51|Gettings|1987|2p=48|Breen|2014|3p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"I asked him when he saw this curious shape."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition.

Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror—she recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger.

The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror."

Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111–112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror."

Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear.

In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness." His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the "very curious downward protrusion" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Dark gray color represents "depression and melancholy."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}{{refn|group=note|Gettings wrote that the form to the right demonstrates a distress of the materialist forming from the mind of one "who is unable to accept that death is a liberation into a higher world, and the proboscis-like feeler which runs from the base of this thought form is said to be reaching into the grave, as if to bring back the dead body."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "The man who had lived in the ordinary blank ignorance with regard to death, had no thought in connection with it but selfish fear and depression; whereas the man who understood the facts was entirely free from any suggestion of those feelings, for the only sentiments evoked in him were those of sympathy and affection for the mourners, and of devotion and high aspiration."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 11}}}}

The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by "the devotional aspiration" to that [[Logos]] may thus be manifested through the man in meditation. It is this religious feeling gives a "pale blue" shade to the five-pointed star. This form has been used "for many ages as a symbol of God manifest in man."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=69}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms created by men who have "mind and emotion well under control and definitely trained in meditation, are clear, symmetrical objects."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} Light blue color, of a "peculiarly clear and luminous shade, represents spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Breen, this thought-form looks like a kind of [[logo]]s in advertising: it can be easily taken as an old oil company sign, "competing with [[Esso]], [[British Petroleum]]and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=112–113}} Nevertheless, according to Bailey, our solar system is the manifested "thought-form" of its Logos.{{sfn|Bailey|1925|p=556}}}}{{refn|group=note|The diversity of guises of thought-forms is almost endless.

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church." This, as the authors explain, "signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively."

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|Бычков|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[František Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|Архив ВТ}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Шабанова}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier à lumières]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|Бычков|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113–114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] famously quoted [[Vedas|Vedic scripture]]... when he witnessed the first atomic bomb blast. But in the context of figures like Besant and Ledbetter, Oppenheimer's fascination with Eastern [[mysticism]] seems less like a personal quirk and more like a thread in a larger tapestry: an interweaving of mysticism, technology, and art that began at the turn of the last century and is still with us in the twenty-first."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}}}

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}
The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Europe''' was a [[Radical feminism|radical]] [[Feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1970s and in some cases into the early 1980s. Inspired by developments in [[North America]] and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. In addition to improvements in working conditions and equal pay, liberationists fought for complete autonomy for women's bodies including their right to make their own decisions regarding [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[abortion]], and more independence in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

Groups which formed typically rejected [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure and operated on the basis of membership consensus, rejecting the idea that leadership conferred any expert status, and instead was simply another experience. They believed [[direct action]]s, which informed the public on the issues women faced, were more productive in changing thoughts than reforming laws. Their aims were to redesign society by changing the perception of women and their roles in society.

Though [[Europe]]an liberationists were more aligned with [[Socialism|socialist]] movements than liberationists in the groups which formed elsewhere, women in the WLM typically viewed class-based struggle as secondary to addressing [[patriarchy]]. Liberationists were resistant to any political system which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines. As groups operated autonomously without centralized organization, there was a fluidity in issues they addressed, but almost all members in the movement felt that unfettered access to education, jobs and [[child care]] were primary issues. Bringing issues to the public, which up to the time had been considered private matters, such as division of household labor, [[lesbian]]ism, objectification of women, and sexual violence, was controversial and met with backlash from the media and public who labeled liberationists as man-haters.

There were robust liberationist movements in almost all [[Western Europe]]an countries, though [[Greece]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] were late to form movements, as they emerged from [[dictatorship]] in the era. By the middle of the 1970s or early 1980s, as compromises were made by liberal reformers and governments on major target issues, most liberationist groups had disbanded or gone on to work on single focus issues.

==Austria==
Though [[Austria]] was a conservative society, known as one of the most traditional in [[Western Europe]], and has been characterized as having had no protests during the early 1970s when the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] was sweeping throughout the world,{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=243}} the characterization belies that women came together and began writing about and analyzing the status of women as second-class citizens from a [[Feminism|feminist]] perspective by the late 1960s.{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=247}} One of the first writers to evaluate women's place in society in the period was [[Barbara Frischmuth]] who published ''Die Klosterschule'' (The Convent School) in 1968. The [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] novel examined the patriarchal structure of the convent school and its training of women to be submissive and passive.{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=252}} That same year, women participated in the student revolts, but were frustrated that they were confined to roles of serving coffee. The ''Arbeitskreis Emanzipation'' (Emancipation Working Group) formed with men and women in 1969 to discuss how women's equality could be furthered.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2003}}

In 1971, a group known as the ''Arbeitskreis Emanzipation der Frau'' (Working Group for Women's Emancipation, AKE) was formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, SPÖ}}). Their goals were to protest the idealization of mothers and eliminate barriers to contraception and abortion. On [[Mother's Day]], 7 May 1971, 130 activists demonstrated on [[Vienna]]'s Mariahilfer Straße to call attention to women's inequality and lack of autonomy to make their own life choices. Hosting a conference the following year in Vienna, the AKE brought women from the states of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], and [[Vorarlberg]] to join with Viennese women to strategize on how to create an autonomous women's movement. Their goals were to be free of the influence of political parties, working to mobilize women to fight for their own liberation, including control of their own bodies and economic choices. From this congress, Erica Fischer, Renate Fleißner, Renate Kohlbacher, [[Eva Kreisky]], Mirl Ofner, Bodil Pedersen, Emmy Scholl, and Jane Wegscheider co-founded the ''Aktion Unabhängiger Frauen'' (Independent Women's Action, AUF) group, hosting the first group meeting in 1972 to discuss whether men should be allowed to participate in their group.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2003}}

In December 1972 the AUF joined with women from the [[Communist Party of Austria]] ({{lang-de|Kommunistische Partei Österreichs, KPÖ}}) and the SPÖ calling for the abolition of section 144 of the criminal code which prohibited abortion.{{sfn|Zach|1989}} Gertrud Edlinger, Rosemarie Fischer, Irmtraud Goessler and Kreisky formed a committee ''Aktionskomitee zur Abschaffung des § 144'' (Action committee for the abolition of section 144) to plan the protest to force a referendum. Using street theater, Erika Mis dressed as a convict with ''§ 144'' emblazoned on her apparel. Other actors posed as a doctor, judge and priest, and at the end of the presentation, Mis chopped the prison cage with an axe.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2004}} A key characteristic of the AUF was its lack of organizational structure, opposition to hierarchy, and opposition to patriarchy within a classless society. Their aims were not focused on reforming laws, but in changing the way that women were perceived and allowed to participate in society. The movement grew rapidly in the early 1970s, but by the middle of the decade had developed many critics. Among them were the [[Socialist feminism|Socialist feminists]], who believed that women's issues would be resolved if class inequality was eliminated and liberal reformers, who felt that by adding women's concerns to existing structures and organizations change would come about. By 1976, AUF dissolved and was reorganized as a women's center with a loose umbrella organizational structure to facilitate groups working on various focal issues regarding women.{{sfn|''Der Funke''|2003}}

==Belgium==

Inspired by the student demonstrations in [[France]] and the Women's Lib movement in the [[United States]], renewed interest in feminism emerged in [[Belgium]] in the late 1960s. Supported by [[Chantal de Smet]] and [[Rose Proesmans]], the [[Flemish]] extension of the Dutch [[Dolle Mina]] (Mad Minas) was effective in influencing public opinion by taking a humorous approach to the cause. In French-speaking [[Wallonia]], a more socially oriented, worker-based movement known as Marie Mineur was founded by [[Jeanne Vercheval]].{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} In [[Brussels]], at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], a group known as ''Le Front de Libération des Femmes'' gained fame by invading the [[Miss Belgium]] event in May 1971, shouting, "Stop the beauty contest, we are not cattle!"{{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}}

That same year, the journal ''Et ta sœur?'' (And your sister?) began publication. The following year, the journal, ''Le Petit livre rouge des femmes'' (The Little Red Book of Women){{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}} was published as an initiative of {{ill|Marie Denis|fr}}. She brought together a wide range of women from various schools of thought on feminism, including liberals, radicals, and [[Socialism|socialists]], as well as workers and intellectuals to compile their thoughts on their lives. The book became very influential, selling 15,000 copies in a few months.{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76–77}} ''De Nieuwe Maand'' (The New Month) was another influential journal published in the period, which attempted to bridge the traditional divides between socialists and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=270–271}}

One of the work groups of ''De Nieuwe Maand'' focused on women's issues and in 1971, they hosted a regional symposium in [[Woumen]] to discuss the similarities women had regardless of their political and religious beliefs and the lack of response on issues effecting women from official organizations and government. This would become the autonomous group ''Vrouwen Overleg Komitee'' (Women's Consultation Committee, VOK), which was predominantly a Flemish organization.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=270–271}} On 11 November 1972, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who had been invited to come to Belgium at the protest held in [[Paris]] on [[International Women's Day]] that year, came to Brussels to speak at a workshop, which they called ''Women's Day'', organized by women from the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]], Flanders, and [[Wallonia]].{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|pp=272–273}} Based upon the success of that meeting, organizers of the VOK prepared a second ''Women's Day'' workshop in [[Antwerp]] and soon were hosting meetings throughout the country in various cities.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=273}}

Out of these various meetings, the focus of the VOK was defined to encourage structural transformation of society, centered on issues such as employment and education. In an effort not to alienate their Catholic members, the organization struggled with its approach to [[abortion]], as they required input and consensus from all women to launch policy directives.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=274}} For the Dolle Minas and the Marie Mineurs, the main issues were initially free contraception and free abortion. The law forbidding access to contraceptives was withdrawn in 1972.{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} In 1974, women of the VOK, preparing for celebrations of the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] adopted the slogan the "Year of the Unemployed Woman" and focused their efforts on bringing awareness that changes needed were not for a year, but for women's lifetimes.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=274}} The VOK finally adopted a policy of pro-choice on reproductive rights and while it lost some of its conservative members over the decision, there were affiliated group like the Catholic ''Vrouw and Maatschappij'' (Women and Society) which continued to work with the VOK.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=275}}

In 1975, members of the VOK rallied at the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament's Palace of the Nation]] protesting the lack of women elected to office. They organized a campaign along with other women's groups to encourage women to vote and to vote for women candidates. By the end of the 1970s, tensions in the various women' groups operating in Belgium grew, as liberals wanted to focus on changing laws and analyzing women's position based on expert opinion. Liberationists, such as the members of the VOK, opposed moving away from the grass-roots nature of women's work and allowing all members to have a voice.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=275}} By 1985, the cooperation and work of liberationists for women's autonomy, had given way to more formally-established, politically organized women's groups. The VOK though reduced in numbers was able to survive the change and by the 1990s, turned toward preventing the sexual abuse of women and the quality of women's lives.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=276}} In 1990 liberals triumphed with partial decriminalization of abortion, and liberationists moved away from the issue.{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} Members of the VOK joined the [[Women in Black]] movement to protest [[Yugoslavia]]n war crimes.{{sfn|Woodward|Mulier|1999|p=277}}

==France==
As early as 1967, women began organizing in [[France]] through various political parties and one group, founded by [[Anne Zelensky]] and [[Jacqueline Feldman]], who had been part of the Women's Democratic Movement, was the ''Féminin, Masculin, Avenir'' (Feminine Masculine Future, FMA), which allowed participation of both female and male activists.{{sfn|Feldman|2009|pp=194–196}} Interest in better conditions for women in France progressed in 1968, inspired by the [[May 1968 events in France|civil unrest in May of that year]].{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Block|2009}} During the occupation of the [[Sorbonne]], Feldman and Zelensky participated in events with the FMA, and realized that preference was given to male activists to speak and the women were shut out.{{sfn|Feldman|2009|p=198}}

[[Antoinette Fouque]], [[Monique Wittig]] and several others organized meetings of women activists from October 1968. The press referred to their activities as MLF or [[Mouvement de libération des femmes]], the French equivalent of the American [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]]. By 1970, the movement began to thrive with demonstrations, including the presentation in August of a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]] to recognize his "even more unknown" wife.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Block|2009}} Typically women who joined the MLF were leftist-leaning politically, had little trust in centralized-hierarchical organization, supported provocation of authority, and believed in revolutionary change for society.{{sfn|Chaperon|1995|p=72}} That same year in April, the FMA became the ''Féminisme, Marxisme, Action'' (Feminist Marxist Action) and its male members left, leaving a unisex, all-woman's group.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=139}} Another liberationist group hosted a demonstration at the [[Paris 8 University|Université de Vincennes]] in May, calling for an end to sexism.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=138}} The MLF began publishing leaflets by anonymous authors styling themselves as "any woman" or "some activists", to emphasize their belief that no one woman could be the spokesperson for all women.{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Articles like "Combat pour la libération de la femme" (Combat for the liberation of women) published in ''L'Idiot International'' and "Libération des femmes, année 0" (Liberation of Women, year zero) in the magazine ''Partisans'' in 1970 became widely read.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=138}} By September 1970, more than one hundred liberationist groups were meeting regularly around Paris.{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=143}}

Activists aligned with the movement began to meet every two weeks at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] and by December 1970, had begun publishing the newspaper ''{{ill|Le torchon brûle|fr}}'' (Waging the Battle).{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Each issue, though the ''[[de facto]]'' editor was {{ill|Marie Dedieu|fr}}, was produced by a different liberationist group as a means of validating a broad spectrum of ideas.{{sfn|Mulard|2011}}{{sfn|Fragments d’Histoire de la gauche radicale|2014}} In April 1971, at one of the meetings at the Beaux-Arts, under the guidance of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], the [[Manifesto of the 343]] calling for free access to contraception and abortion was signed by 343 prominent women, which would become one of the main rallying points of the movement.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Sinard|2017}} In 1979, after a demonstration preceding the passage of the [[Abortion in France|Veil Law]],{{sfn|Picq|2008}} named after [[Simone Veil]] the parliamentarian who pushed through abortion reform,{{sfn|Chan|2017}} Antoinette Fouque, Marie-Claude Grumbach and Sylvina Boissonnas secretly filed paperwork to form an association and trademarked the name "Mouvement de liberation des femmes – MLF" with the Institute of Industrial and Commercial Property.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}{{sfn|Delphy|1991|p=145}} Activists and publishers immediately protested against the misappropriation of their actions which took a movement, belonging to all, and made it the private property of a few with the ability to legally forbid use of the name.{{sfn|Picq|2008}}

==Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F042511-0014,_Bonn,_Protest_gegen_§_218.jpg|alt=Hunger strike against abortion reforms in Bonn, 22 April 1974.|thumb|Hunger strike against abortion reforms in Bonn, 22 April 1974.]]
During the student protests in 1968, in [[West Germany]], women who were part of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]] in [[West Berlin]] formed the ''{{ill|Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frau|de}}'' (Action Council for the Liberation of Women). Their concerns were not only the expectations society placed upon women to confine their role to the family, but also the lack of commitment to women's emancipation by their fellow [[Socialism|socialists]]. Focusing on child care centers, the ''Aktionsrat'' members set up [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] facilities in [[Berlin]] to teach children [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] roles.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}} Soon thereafter, on 13 September  1968, at the SDS Federal Congress in [[Frankfurt]], [[Helke Sander]] gave a speech articulating the reasons for the founding of ''Aktionsrat'' and the need to politicize the issues of women, which were still considered private matters. Her speech was not taken seriously by the men in attendance and angered at their arrogance, {{ill|Sigrid Rüger|de|Sigrid Damm-Rüger}} threw three [[tomato]]es at the podium, hitting {{ill|Hans-Jürgen Krahl|de}}, one of the leaders of the SDS, in the face. The tomato became a symbol for the women's movement thereafter.{{sfn|Göpfert|2018}}{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}} Women in Frankfurt founded the ''Frauen den Weiberrat'' (Women's Council) soon after the congress and excluded men from their meetings.{{sfn|Göpfert|2018}} By November a ''Frauen den Weiberrat'' had been established in [[Hanover]].{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}}

Women, as elsewhere in the period, formed collectives which held consciousness-raising sessions and offered advice to other women on issues such as health care,{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}} discussing things like the dangers of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], alternative [[Birth control|contraception]] devices and [[abortion]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}}  One such group was ''Brot und Rosen'' (Bread and Roses) a collective formed in Berlin, founded by Helke Sander, when ''Aktionsrat'' disbanded in 1969.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Similar small groups formed in various parts of the country taking small initiatives,{{sfn|''Die Welt''|2008}} though liberationists were more restrained than elsewhere in Europe.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} In part, this was because of the movement's apolitical stance, but also in part because [[consciousness-raising]] and the maxim "the personal is political" were the [[antithesis]] to German leftists. For example, the word used to describe feminist consciousness-raising was ''Selbsterfahrung'' (self-experience), which equated to bourgeois, individualistic expression; while the political left used the term ''Aufklärung'' (enightenment), which has a serious, political and intellectual connotation.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}}

The cause in West Germany was expanded by the German journalist [[Alice Schwarzer]], who became active in France in 1970, where she had been behind the "Manifesto of the 343" calling for free access to abortion. She managed to convince [[Wilfried Maaß]] to have a similar "Manifesto of the 374" published in the ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. Appearing on 6 June 1971 under the heading ''[[We've had abortions!|Wir haben abgetrieben!]]'' (We have had abortions) and signed by prominent figures such as the actress [[Romy Schneider]], it was immediately effective, causing pro-abortion pressure groups to be created throughout the country.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} The ''Aktion 218'' campaign, a reference to the section of the criminal code which banned abortion, was instigated by students in [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[West Berlin]].{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300–301}}{{sfn|Morris|Withers|2018|p=277}} A public display on the topic of abortion was at a rally held by various groups in November 1971 in [[Düsseldorf]], where it gained mass support.{{sfn|Harrigan|1982}}

Helke Sander and [[Verena Stefan]], among others, living in the collective ''Brot und Rosen'' published ''Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verhütungsmittel'' (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives) in 1971.{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}}{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Within three years, the "yellow" original 30,000 copies had sold out and the second "red" edition was published.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} Similarly, Stefan's autobiographical novel, ''Häutungen'' (Shedding), published in 1975 quickly sold and was in its 5th edition by 1976. Chronicling Stefan's journey to free herself from the indifference and exploitation of women towards a life shared with women and embracing homosexuality, ''Häutungen'' became a best seller and inspiration to many in the movement.{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}}

In 1971, Homosexual Action West Berlin (HAW) was formed and within a year, eight lesbians had joined the movement opening a women's group within HAW in a commune in [[Schöneberg]]. Among the eight members of the group were [[Ilse Kokula]], Monne Kühn, [[Gisela Necker]], [[Cristina Perincioli]], [[Eva Rieger]], Waltraut Siepert, and [[Christel Wachowski]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Little Band of Perverts (1972)}} Some of these women were instrumental in founding the Berlin Women's Center. Placing an advertisement in the alternative journal ''Hundert Blumen'', in November 1972, Perincioli and Siepert attracted around seventy women who were interested in an apolitical group where women could meet, share publications, counsel and interact with other women. Small subgroups formed and women in each group worked on various topics which were of interest to them. Issues concerned a wide berth of topics including: consciousness-raising, publication, sexuality, and women in prison, among others. There was also a group which demonstrated against the law banning abortion, provided counseling, and arranged medical intervention trips to the Netherlands.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Starting the Berlin Women's Center (1972)}} By 1973, there were active groups working in [[Bochum]], [[Bonn]], [[Bremen]], [[Cologne]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Giessen]], [[Munich]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Tübingen]] on various issues, and networks of support among the various groups and women's centers. A nationwide meeting of liberationist groups took place in Munich in 1973 and in 1974, they met again in Cologne.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1973 German Feminist Groups Report}}

In 1974, liberationists organized a women's festival at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1974 Flying Lesbians, Feminist Festivals}} ''Brot und Rosen'' organized a large event discussing abortion where various women talked about illegal abortionists and filed a complaint against several doctors, though no investigation ever resulted.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1971 Bread and Roses}} The Berlin Women's Center organized a public women's party and rejecting male musicians featured women artists like {{ill|Ina Deter|de}} and the [[Flying Lesbians]].{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1974 Flying Lesbians, Feminist Festivals}} The 1974 murder trial of Judy Andersen and Marion Ihns for the murder of Ihns' abusive husband became a rallying point for women, who held protests inside and outside the courthouse in [[Itzehoe]].{{sfn|Altbach|Clausen|Schultz|Stephan|1984|p=182}}{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1973-74 Witch Hunt}} Bringing domestic violence to the forefront for the first time in Germany, the trial brought recognition of the magnitude of the problem and led to the establishment of the Berlin women's shelter in 1976 and a rape crisis hotline the following year.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=Women Against Violence (1974–76)}} By 1982, as had happened on an international scale, there was backlash from both society at large and liberal reformist feminists against the liberationists and they became less visible.{{sfn|Altbach|Clausen|Schultz|Stephan|1984|p=182}}

==Greece==
The first women's group autonomous from a political party in [[Greece]] formed in 1975 as the ''Kinisi gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (Movement for the Liberation of Women, KAG), in [[Athens]]. Adopting slogans from the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in the [[United States]] they believed that personal issues could be politicized.{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} Their first public action in 1976 was to protest the lack of access to [[Birth control|contraception]].{{sfn|de Haan|Bucur|Daskalova|2007|p=181}} As the country had just emerged from [[dictatorship]] and a new constitution was being discussed, members of the movement sought to bring attention to the inequalities faced by women in their families and society. They established a newspaper ''Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (For the Liberation of Women) to disseminate their ideas,{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} publishing articles about child care, employment, ideology and sexuality. After four years the group dissolved.{{sfn|Hellenic Parliament Foundation|n.d.}}

==Ireland==
In Dublin, a group called the [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]] (IWLM) was founded in 1970 when [[Máirín de Burca]], invited a working-class homemaker Máirín  Johnston, journalist Mary Maher, physician Moira Woods, to join her on Monday nights at [[Margaret Gaj]]’s café on Baggot Street in Dublin.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=42–43}} Inspired by the WLM in the United States, the non-hierarchical structure of the movement and the shock approach to addressing discrimination appealed to the group.{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}} Soon after forming, the group published a pamphlet, ''Chains or Change'', outlining their goals, which included equal education, pay and legal rights; removal of the [[Marriage bar|ban]] against work for married women; fair treatment of deserted wives, unwed mothers and widows; and access to family services such as child care, playgrounds and contraception.{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}}{{sfn|Farren|2006}}

The IWLM appeared on the [[The Late Late Show (Irish TV series)|Late Late Show]] in 1971 and conducted protests and activism.{{sfn|Farren|2006}} They led the [[Contraceptive Train]] to bring attention to the hypocrisy of the state's ban on contraception, as officials were unable to enforce it. At the time, the only legal contraceptive was the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]], but it could not be prescribed except as a medication to regulate menstrual cycles. Protesting women boarded a train in Dublin and traveled to Belfast to purchase condoms. Upon the return trip, they distributed the contraband condoms to the crowd, flouting the official ban.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} After a year, the group dissolved, but was widely influential in that short time-period in changing the societal perception of women.{{sfn|Farren|2006}}

In 1975, the [[Irish Women United]] formed as a liberationist group in Dublin. Their first protest actions were to demonstrate against the male-only [[Forty Foot]] bathing area at [[Dublin Bay]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club]]. They also picketed the [[Miss Ireland]] beauty pageant and competition, and protested during the trial of [[Noreen Winchester]],{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} who had been imprisoned after killing her sexually abusive father.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1978}} They hosted consciousness-raising sessions and sought removal of legal barriers and bureaucratic obstacles to an egalitarian society including, divorce equal education and pay, free contraception, and self-determined sexuality. To publicize their goals and issues, they created the journal ''Banshee'' and published eight issues before the group dissolved in 1977.{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} Liberationist groups also formed in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Limerick]], establishing women's centres and refuges as well as rape crisis centres.{{sfn|Galligan|1998|p=57}}

[[File:Demonstration_for_abortion_rights_in_Milan,_1975.jpg|alt=Demonstration for abortion rights in Milan, 1975|left|thumb|Demonstration for abortion rights in Milan, 1975]]
In 1967, at the regional congress of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] held in [[Bologna]], the issues of sexual and psychological freedom were first brought to discussion as political topics. The following year at the national convention of the party in [[Rome]], the discussion broadened to include [[sexual repression]] and [[Oppression|social oppression]], and a motion was approved to focus on these issues. In 1969, the regional congress in [[Milan]] adopted similar themes, which led to the creation in the winter of 1969–1970 of the group ''Movimento di Liberazione della Donna'' (MLD) ([[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]]). The two planks of the organization were to liberate women by affirming their right to be free and control their own bodies, and to create the necessary health structures to legalize abortion.{{sfn|Radical Party Archive|1972}} From the beginning the organization had political aims, and constructed a plan of action to decriminalize [[abortion]]. By 1975, the organization had split from the Radial Party and become an independent organization fighting for the change to the civil codes dealing with family law.{{sfn|Herstory|n.d.|p=MLD—Movimento di Liberazione della Donna}}

The goals of the [[Italy|Italian]] movement were to make women and their issues a political subject, taking the family out of the private sphere; to create new types of organizations and practices, which allowed women to become political actors; and to redefine the methods of engagement with institutions, political parties and other social organizations.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}} In 1969 a women's only collective, ''Collectivo delle Compagne'' (Collective of Companions, CDC) formed in [[Turin]], in response to the refusal of male activists to print texts on the liberation movement. Led by Maria Clara Rogozinski and [[Maria-Teresa Fenoglio]], the collective attracted hundreds of members and in 1971 renamed the group, which had become a [[commune]], ''Colletivo di Via Petrarca'', after the street on which it was located. At the meetings of the group, consciousness-raising sessions were held to assist women in removing the boundaries between their personal and public lives and recognizing how private matters could be politicized.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=134}}

In Rome, a sexual-health movement, which centered on women's [[reproductive rights]], discovering their own body and sexuality, and creating facilities to offer solutions to women developed.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}} Known as the ''Comitato romano per la liberalizzazione dell’aborto e della contracezzione ''(Roman committee to liberalize abortion and [[Birth control|contraception]], CRAC) the group rejected any involvement by either medical professionals or the state in women's complete control of their own bodies, though they did support state run medial facilities offering services to women.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} In 1970, ''Rivolta femminile'' (Feminist Revolt) was founded in Rome by [[Carla Lonzi]], along with [[Carla Accardi]] and {{ill|Elvira Banotti|it}}, as a rejection of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]], declaring that women were not oppressed as a social class, but rather oppressed because of their gender.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Herstory|n.d.|p=Rivolta Femminile}} In [[Naples]], the collective ''Le Nemesiache'', founded by {{ill|Lina Mangiacapre|it}} in 1970, held reenactments of fables and myths as all-women productions, to assist in consciousness-raising, using the arts as a form of protest.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Pojmann|2017|pp=81–82}} ''Le Nemesiache''′s Manifesto proclaimed that women need not integrate into masculine society or strive for legal equality, but should find their own definitions of what being a woman meant.{{sfn|Pojmann|2017|pp=81–82}} ''Cerchio spezzato'' (Broken Circle) was formed in 1970 by students from the [[University of Trento]], as the first group to advocate separatism. Members saw the [[sexual revolution]] as a means to objectify women and traditional leftist groups as invalidating women's full participation in society.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=65}}

In 1972 ''Il Collettivo di via Cherubini 8'' (The Collective at 8 Cherubini Street) formed in Milan, and began publishing the magazine ''Sottosopra'' (Upside Down) to disseminate feminist materials from throughout Italy. An important group in Milan, they hosted several international conferences, meeting with liberationists from [[France]] and [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} While they were willing to allow men to participate in protest, the members believed that only women could define their own sexuality.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} In 1974 the ''Gruppo Analis i'' (Group Analyst I) and the following year the ''gruppi di Pratica dell'inconscio'' (Practice Groups of the Unconscious) both formed in Milan for the purpose of analyzing the ties between women. Neither were involved in individual analysis, but rather in evaluating the psychology that was shared by women.{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} On 3 April 1976 when some 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome, calling for abortion on demand. Liberationists failed in their aims, as under the influence of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], a compromise solution was reached, giving doctors, rather than women themselves, the necessary decision-making powers, but in practice women were now granted the right to abortion.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=86}}{{sfn|Rossi|Degiarde|Verlicchi|1977|p=50}}

The ''Collettivo Femminista di Santa Croce'' (Feminist Collective of Santa Croce) which formed in Florence in 1973, participated in a national conference held in their home city in December 1977, known as ''Donna e follia'' (Woman and Folly). The two aims of the conference were to explore how women could choose to rebel from the strictures of society on a personal level without being considered insane by the rest of society. Many came away from the meeting with mixed feelings, understanding that through the collectives they had gained support from other women who understood their issues, but by having isolated themselves to find their voice, they had in fact marginalized themselves from the greater society.{{sfn|''Effe''|1977}} By the end of the 1970s, the movement became fragmented and activists focus moved toward working on private projects, rather than in the public sphere.{{sfn|Beccalli|1994}}

==Netherlands==

The WLM movement in the [[Netherlands]], as elsewhere, was born out of the political climate of the late 1960s, which included the anti-Vietnam, the student movement, and the Dutch [[Provo (movement)|Provo Movement]], a provocative movement aimed at undermining ''[[The Establishment]]''. At the time, there was international discussion on [[sexuality]], [[sexual liberation]], [[sexual orientation]], and the relationship of those to marriage, topics that up to that time had not been considered to be political issues. The concept of [[patriarchy]] and a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society did not exist at the time. [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smit]] wrote an article ''Het onbehagen bij de vrouw'' (The Discontent of Women) in 1967 which attempted to put into words the issues for women in Dutch society.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|p=391}} In 1968, she formed the [[Man Vrouw Maatschappij]] (Man woman society) as a coalition between men and women to address the inequalities from a liberal position of changing legislation through lobbying.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}}{{sfn|Doomen|1997}}

In 1969, a group calling themselves the "[[Dolle Mina|Mad Minas]]" ({{lang-nl|Dolle Minas}}) formed with a far more radical position, engaging in public protests to call attention to sexism.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}}{{sfn|Doomen|1997}} Through consciousness-raising sessions, the Minas met and discussed the issues that they faced in their lives and how those could be politicized. Between January 1970 and October 1974 they staged numerous protests, the first of which was lodged against the [[Nyenrode Business University]], which did not allow women to enroll at that time.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}} In 1970, they led a protest in [[Amsterdam]] to address anonymous [[groping]]. Sitting on parked cars and bikes, the demonstrators whistled at male bypassers. Entering bars they pinched the [[buttocks]] of male patrons to emphasize their objectification.{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} Other actions in which they participated included protests for day care centers, reproductive rights and women's toilets in public spaces.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=12–13}} After 1972, most of the Minas protests were focused on the issue of legalized abortion and their most successful campaign was called ''Baas in eigen Buik'' (Boss of your Belly), which argued for women's right to govern their own decisions regarding their bodies.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13–14}}

In 1971, a group known as {{ill|Purple September|nl|Paarse September}} formed along the lines of liberationist lesbians in the United States. Their name derived from [[Betty Friedan]]'s reference to lesbians as the "[[Lavender Menace]]" and they operated as a separatist group, believing that all women were lesbian and should not bed their oppressers.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|p=12}} Rather than reforming the existing society with its [[Hierarchy|hierarchical structure]] giving men priority, they called for the creation of separate societies for women to evaluate their marginal positions in the family and society as well as the politicization of personal issues.{{sfn|Wietsma|2005}} These ideas were characterized by Dutch media much as they were in other places and women who advocated for separatism were seen as being anti-male.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|p=395}} After 1974, the liberationist groups in the Netherlands gave way to action groups and liberal feminist groups aimed at legal change, as they believed that thought had significantly changed and political action was necessary.{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13–14}}

==Portugal==
The Women's Liberation Movement came to [[Portugal]] via the "trial of the three Marys"—[[Maria Teresa Horta]], [[Maria Isabel Barreno]] and [[Maria Velho da Costa]].{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=48}} In 1972, Horta, Barreno and Velho da Costa published ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' (New Portuguese Letters),{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=24}} a critique of the repression imposed by the Portuguese state since the advent of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]], specifically upon women{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=32-34}} under the arbitrary and patriarchal governing systems.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=74}} The authors were arrested shortly after the book's printing and charged with violating public [[Morality|moral codes]] and publishing [[censorship]] laws. When the book was banned by censors of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano regime]], the Marys smuggled copies of the book to [[France]]. Sending copies with a cover letter in French to [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], and [[Christiane Rochefort]], they called on international feminists for help.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=28}} [[Feminism|Feminists]] rallied to their support using the book as a feminist icon for the unity of sistership, hosting demonstrations of support in [[Belgium]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], as well as in major cities in the United States like [[Boston]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D. C.]] and bringing international pressure to bear on the Portuguese regime.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=63–64}} Ironically, ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' was not translated except in fragments until after the authors' acquittal in 1974.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=28–29}} The ban of the book, and subsequently ban on discussing it, or the trial, on the news, meant that within Portugal, it was not read either.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=61}} Subsequently, it was translated into [[French language|French]] (1974), [[English language|English]] (1975), [[German language|German]] (1976) and [[Italian language|Italian]] (1977).{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=28–29}}

Two weeks after the [[Carnation Revolution]] ousted Marcelo Caetano from power 25 April 1974, the Marys were acquitted. Velho da Costa immediately distanced herself from the book and the feminist movement making a public declaration that the text had not been a feminist treatise, but was written against [[Fascism|fascist]] repression. Barreno refuted Velho da Costa's stance in a public rebuttal.{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|p=31}} [[Madalena Barbosa]] and Horta founded the group ''Movimento de Libertação das Mulheres'' (Women's Liberation Movement, MLM) in May 1974, to utilize the momentum created by the trial to improve women's conditions.{{sfn|''Público''|2008}}{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=73, 83}} Support from other international feminists continued with activists from France, Germany and the Netherlands regularly attending meetings and conferences, providing literature, and providing financial support in Portugal.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=84}} [[Célia Metrass]] and {{ill|Regina Louro|pt|Maria Regina Louro}} were influential members of the group, but as elsewhere, it was formed without hierarchical leadership and met in small groups, where women explored their personal experiences to evaluate commonalities with other women and politicize them.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=87–88}} Influenced by the French feminists, small subgroups formed to discuss issues which were of interest to them, including access to employment, restrictions of motherhood, sexuality, among others.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=89, 91}}

On 13 January 1975, the MLM held a demonstration in [[Eduardo VII Park]] to bring attention to the objectification of women. The press reported that they would be burning [[bra]]s and there would be a [[striptease]], fueling curiosity as well as disdain for the activists. They were not allowed to burn the [[veil]], [[mop]] or flowers, carried by three activists dressed as a bride, a [[housewife]] and a sex symbol.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=101–103}}{{sfn|Bernardino|2017}} In February of that year, the MLM published the ''Manifesto de Movimento para a Contracepção e Aborto Livre e Gratuito'' (Manifesto of the Movement for Contraception and Free and Abortion, MCALG), demanding free distribution of contraception and educational materials as well as access to abortion and abolition of laws preventing women from controlling their own reproduction. Horta, Célia Metrass and Helena Sá de Medeiros laid out the position of the MLM in their book ''Aborto, Direito ao Nosso Corpo'' (Abortion, Right to Our Body, 1975); abortion was an individual right and not subject to the control by the moral position of the majority.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=108}}

In April 1975, after a year of meeting in members' homes, the group found a derelict building on Avenida Pedro Álvares Cabral, in [[Lisbon]] and took over the space.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=93}} One of the critical issues was women's right to control their own bodies, and they demanded not only the right to contraception and abortion, but instituted a campaign for sexual education. Unlike other places, the military, specifically those involved with the [[Movimento das Forças Armadas]], who had implemented the ''[[coup d'état]]'', worked with the MLM on issues of family violence, because [[wartime sexual violence]] was high at the time.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=94}} The group continued to work on various women's issues through 1979, though never gaining the same visibility as they had with the park protest. Turning their attentions more toward publishing efforts, at the end of the decade, members founded the ''Cooperativa Editorial de Mujeres'' (Women's Editorial Cooperative, 1977) and later the ''Cooperativa Informação, Documentação, Mulher'' (Cooperative Information, Documentation, Women, 1979). They believed that the time for organizing in the street had passed and that the focus should move toward analysis and creating discourse on the issues.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=112–114}}

==Scandinavia==
The development of the second wave of women's movements in [[Scandinavia]] continued the interest in improved conditions for women which had begun in [[Denmark]] in 1871 with the [[Danish Women's Society]] (''Dansk Kvindesamfund''). In contrast to the [[United States]] where many organizations were disbanded after the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] had been achieved, work in the Scandinavian countries had continued without interruption. Renewed interest in [[gender]] and equality emerged in the 1960s as individuals such as [[Elsa Gress]], [[Åse Gruda Skard]] and [[Alva Myrdal]] promoted debate and commissions on the status of women were formed. In particular the [[Red Stocking Movement (Denmark)|Redstockings]] (''Rødstrømpebevægelsen'') in Denmark and the New Feminists (''Nyfeministene'') in [[Norway]] reflected most of the trends emerging in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|pp=22–23}} As elsewhere, the movement was open to all women. Men were typically discouraged from participation to allow women to develop their agenda on their own terms. Organizations were decentralized and non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], focused on societal change rather than reform for rights, and relied on consciousness-raising to help women politicize their issues.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=26}} Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}{{#tag:ref|The radical movement in Finland was not a liberationist movement. Beginning in 1965, newspapers published information about gender roles. Born out of the Finnish student movement and the peace movement, ''[[Sadankomitea]]'', women formed [[Association 9]]. The organization, which included both men and women, sought equal status with men in all things that women "were allowed to do".{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}} Defining women by societal perceptions of them, the association pushed boundaries by requiring equal obligations, opportunity and rights, through gender role activism.{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}}{{sfn|Saarenmaa|2017|p=138}}|group="Notes"}}

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] had its roots in the 1960s when large numbers of women began to enter the labour market, requiring services such as child care and improved health care. Supported by the Danish Women's Society, the [[Red Stocking Movement (Denmark)|Red Stocking Movement]] was established in 1970. It fought in particular for equal pay for men and women and for better treatment of women in the workplace,{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}}{{sfn|Larsen|2014}} with one of its first public protests being a sit-in on public buses in [[Copenhagen]] in May 1970. To demonstrate the variance in women's and men's wages, activists insisted that their fare should be 20% less than that charged to men, as that was the pay gap on their wages.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}} Among many public protests liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants and walked through the streets, costumed in outlandish, suggestive clothing, to agitate against being treated as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]].{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}} The following year, Redstockings hosted an all-women summer camp, allowing only male children, if they were under age thirteen. The success of the camp led to experiments in communal living and women's homes, as well as a [[Feminism|feminist]] festival, hosted in 1974.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}}

The first three to four years of the liberationist movement saw many new issues raised for public debate, including matters previously considered private family concerns like [[abortion]], child care, distribution of domestic chores, [[incest]], and [[sexual violence]], among others. Liberationists were successful in their demands concerning abortion in Denmark, as the law which previously gave limited access, changed in 1973 granting free service on demand with paid sick leave. In 1972, members protested and women campaigned against entry into the European Community, fearing that harmonization of Europe might deteriorate their rights. Danish liberationists preferred to work autonomously and did not integrate with traditional political parties. They focused their demonstrations toward women, society in general and workers and away from governmental lobbying efforts. From the mid-1970s, when state initiatives, such as the Equal Status Council formed in 1975 to address [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] inequality, direct actions by the liberationists ceased.{{sfn|Carrere|Chetaille|Podoleva|2001}}

===Iceland===
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in [[Iceland]] was inspired by the [[Denmark|Danish]] and Dutch [[Redstockings|Redstocking]] movement and began in 1968, when the first meeting was held.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}}{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=85}} Launching a journal ''Forvitin rauð'' (Red and curious), the Redstockings explored controversial topics such as abortion, inequality, oppression and the role of women in society. Media portrayed women affiliated with the Redstockings as unkempt and unfeminine man-haters.{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=85}} Demonstrations of women wearing red stockings took place on 1 May 1970, as part of the [[Labour Day]] activities. While the majority of women supported socialist class struggle, a small group broke off from the Redstockings joining the more politically neutral Women's Rights Organization (''[[Icelandic Women's Rights Association|Kvénrettindafélag]]'').{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}}

In 1975, Redstockings proposed a women's strike and participated with other women's groups in organizing a massive demonstration known as ''[[1975 Icelandic women's strike|Women's Day Off]]''. Ninety percent of the women in Iceland struck on 24 October 1975 to demonstrate how vital their participation was in society. Working women refused to work and home makers left child care and domestic chores to their male partners to attended the protest. Men juggled the demands that women typically had to deal with trying to work, while attending to children. Without workers, businesses and schools were forced to close and fathers without day care facilities had to take their children to their work places.{{sfn|Brewer|2015}} The event made worldwide headlines{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=27}} and spurred the government to pass a law guaranteeing that men and women had equality the following year.{{sfn|Rennebohm|2009}} As elsewhere, liberationists declined by the end of the decade as their values became mainstream and reforms changed the society.{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=87}}

===Norway===
[[Norway|Norwegian]] women began reading literature on the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] when ''Myten om kvinnen'', the translation of [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published in 1968 and was widely read.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}} When American liberationist [[Jo Freeman]] visited [[Oslo]] in 1970, Norwegian women became interested in new ways to approach addressing women's policy.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} Inspired by activities in [[Denmark]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], the New Feminists (''Nyfeministene'') emerged that same year with action groups in [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and other large cities,{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=28}} as women began to search for an identity outside their homes and sought personal development.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}} In the quest to identify for themselves who or what they wanted to be, women in the liberationist movement rejected the notion that equality could be attained in a society in which they were dependent upon men and challenged societal gender roles.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=39}} Uninterested in analysis and reform, they believed that the perception of women could be changed through direct action, which made the public aware of issues such as a woman's control of her own body, the need for day care, the objectification of women, and a working environment which offered equal opportunity, pay and working conditions.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

Members of New Feminists were leftist, but mostly apolitical and rejected [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizational structures,{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}} this brought them into conflict with groups such as the Women's Front (''Kvinnefronten'') founded in 1972, which called for a specific socialist policy for women, verging on Communism.{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|p=28}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=136}} New Feminists believed that the similarities in women's lives because of their bodies, their responsibility for family, and even their sexual experience, bound women into a sisterhood which could not be addressed by traditional class-based activism or structures which had fixed goals. Women's autonomy and gaining their own awareness through consciousness-raising were critical, as liberationists believed that changing oneself and society depended on active evaluation of ones' experiences. Leadership had no special value, as leaders' experiences were not more or less true than other women's experiences. Subgroups quickly spread throughout Norway but monthly joint meetings were held in Oslo.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

In 1972, with the release of [[Esther Vilar]]'s book ''[[The Manipulated Man]]'', [[Nina Karin Monsen]] led a group of activists to protest at the publishing house [[Aschehoug]]. Their concern was that since Friedan had been translated, no feminist texts had been released, but Vilar's anti-feminist book was published. The pressure caused the publisher to release a Norwegian translation of the Swedish title ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood) by {{ill|Maud Hägg|sv}} and {{ill|Barbro Werkmäster|sv}} in 1973. That same year, during demonstrations held on [[International Women's Day]], New Feminists were kicked out of the march in Oslo by members of the Women's Front. Undeterred, the liberationists went to a nearby basement and created banners bearing slogans like ''No for forced labor'', ''No forced births'', ''I am the prime minister'' to spread their message. In January 1973, when members of the New Feminists were refused service at the pub ''Sofus'' on Klingenberggata by managers claiming they were trying to keep prostitutes from their premises, they staged two sit-ins in the establishment. Bringing attention to the unequal treatment by the bar for men and women and showing solidarity with the sex workers, the liberationists forced the bar to close and reopen with a different policy.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}

New Feminists founded a journal, ''[[Sirene (magazine)|Sirene]]'' in 1973 with the aim of uniting various liberationist groups and disseminating information.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=37}} The journal's attack on [[Housewife|housewives]] was an effort to win women to the cause, as  liberationists used the discontent and unhappiness many women felt with the "housewife/breadwinner system" to fuel the idea that being an unpaid or underpaid laborer led to invisibility and frustration, but the stance caused controversy.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|pp=39–40}} That same year the liberationists held a national committee meeting in [[Sandnes]] for the 200 autonomous organizations throughout the country. The national committee established its own journal, ''Feministen'' and published the common goals of various groups, but did not serve as an executive board or direct the local groups.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} 1973 also marked the year, liberationists began to publicly support lesbian liberation, though in 1974, to address their different needs ''Lesbisk bevegelse'' (Lesbian Movement) was founded by former New Feminist members.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}}

Abortion as part of a woman's right to control her body had been a major part of the New Feminists activism since their founding. In 1975, when the [[Norwegian parliament]] was debating the issue, New Feminists, hiding slogan placards under their coats, asked for a tour, entered the chamber, and protested, demanding unrestricted access to abortion as well as no coercion on the subject. Removal by the police did not prevent further action, such as when the following year liberationists ringed the exterior of the [[Storting building]] singing songs and carrying banners in peaceful protest. Police were again called to break up the protest.{{sfn|Nørve|2007}}{{sfn|Iversen|1978}} In 1975, during the annual women's meeting in Oslo, the group, ''Brød og Roser'' (Bread and Roses) came together from activists who left Women's Front because of its close alignment with the [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Communist Party]] ({{lang-no|Arbeidernes Kommunistparti, AKP}}). They officially formed in March 1976 under the theme that whatever the root cause of women's oppression, they were united in their need for bread (economic liberation) and roses (sisterhood and love). Combining both a class-based and sexist based theory, but acknowledging that some of their members were not socialists, Bread and Roses had subgroups throughout the country.{{sfn|Iversen|1978}}

In 1977 liberationists returned to the [[objectification]] of women and worked with other feminist organizations in the fight against pornography. Creating a traveling exhibition, they protested the consumption of women, which they saw as a catalyst for sexual violence against women.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|pp=152–153}} That same year New Feminists in Oslo began the first domestic violence hot line and the following year opened the first emergency women's shelter. Quickly hotlines and shelters became scattered across Norway,{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=154}} as did negative press characterizing activists working against sexual violence as man-haters.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=156}} Interest in feminism nevertheless spread with the support of other women's organizations in the country leading to activism in the universities and in sports.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}}

On 8 March 1978, some 20,000 women demonstrated for improved rights.{{sfn|Lønnå|2003}} Ironically, at the height of their influence, radical groups were splintering. The 1978 march was actually two marches, one led by the Women's Front, the Norwegian Women's Association ({{lang-no|Norsk Kvinneforbund}}),  the Oslo Women's Legal Rights Association ({{lang-no|Oslo Kvinnesaksforening}}), and various communist groups, which began at [[Youngstorget]]. The other led by the Oslo Women's Equal Rights Association, gathered at {{ill|Fridjof Nansen's Place|no|Fridtjof Nansens plass (Oslo)}} before starting their march. Members of Bread and Roses, the Lesbian Movement and New Feminists, marched in each protest.{{sfn|Hassenstab|2015|pp=229–230}} In December, 1978, an abortion reform bill was passed which did not meet liberationists demands but rather required women to be advised before making a choice up to the 12th week of pregnancy. After that time, the decision was to be made by a committee.{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=145}} ''Sirene'' published its final issue in 1983.{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=39}}

===Sweden===
In 1968, {{ill|Karin Westman Berg|sv}} began giving a series of lectures on [[women's history]] at [[Uppsala University]] in a newly developed class on [[gender]]. Two of her students, Birgitta Bolinder and {{ill|Birgitta Svanberg|sv}}, who were working teachers attended Berg's night classes. Deciding to form a discussion group, eight of the students founded ''[[Group 8 (Sweden)|Grupp 8]]'' (Group 8) to evaluate the gender and class struggle. The study group operated for two years, but {{ill|Gunilla Thorgren|sv}} felt they needed to become more active.{{sfn|Harr|2014}}{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=18}} In 1970, ''Grupp 8'' opened to new members, attracting around 100 interested women at their first meeting in [[Stockholm]]{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} and soon spread throughout Sweden. That same year women in [[Lund]], established ''Kvinnoligan'' (Women's League), after a member brought the book ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' home after a visit to the United States.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} Both groups were formed from women who had come out of male-dominated leftist organizations where women's roles were marginalized{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} and they shunned [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization, relying on discussion groups for women to increase their awareness through consciousness-raising.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}}

Leading up to the 1970 elections, members of ''Grupp 8'' protested at the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) rally outside the [[Parliament House, Stockholm|Parliament building]]. Rolling out banners with slogans, {{ill|Iréne Matthis|sv}} took the microphone to ask why women were forced to work as part-time employees and thus were ineligible for [[pension]]s. Members of the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]] forced the activists away, threatening them with their fists.{{sfn|Harr|2014}} That same year two members, Maud Hägg and Barbro Werkmäster published ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood).{{sfn|''Skånska Dagbladet''|2018}} In February 1971, the [[Studentafton]] at [[Lund University]] scheduled a meeting which was later called ''The Women's Camp'' inviting liberationists from Denmark, the [[United Kingdom]] and members from ''Grupp 8''. Over 1,000 women and men participated in the event, the first women's meeting held in the era in Sweden, which prompted a surge of growth in ''Kvinnoligan'',{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} with branches forming in Malmö.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}} Around the same time, ''Grupp 8'' founded a journal ''Kvinnobulletinen'' (Women's Bulletin),{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=19}} outlining their aims and began publishing on a variety of issues such as employment reforms, free childcare centers, unrestricted access to [[abortion]], and the objectification of women.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} Initial articles were written from a Marxist perspective, emphasizing the needs of [[Working class|working-class]] women,{{sfn|Dahlerup|Gulli|2013|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Elgán|2002}} but by 1972, these had been replaced with feminist articles addressing such issues as [[pornography]] and [[prostitution]].{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}

Both groups addressed issues through direct action, using demonstrations, heckling, street theatre performances, and art exhibitions, such as a demonstration held on 8 March 1971, by ten members of ''Grupp 8'' who protested for daycare centers and unrestricted abortion in Stockholm.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}}{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}}  The following year, working with members of the {{ill|Swedish Women's Left-wing Association|sv|Svenska Kvinnors Vänsterförbund}} ({{lang-sv|Svenska Kvinnors Vänsterförbund}}), liberationists organized the first public participation in what would become an annual International Women's Day event.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} A month later, on 8 April 1972, ''Grupp 8'' hosted an exhibition "Women" at the ''[[Moderna Museet]]'' which featured various aspects of women's lives, including intimate details, like [[menstruation]]. 13,000 people visited the installation within a month, spurred by media reports which not only analyzed the exhibit, but ridiculed the liberationists as well, characterizing them as "ugly and sexually frustrated".{{sfn|Harr|2014}} That same year the SAP added initiatives to their platform to address women's issues, over the protests of ''Grupp 8'', which believed that the patriarchal state was hijacking the movement.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}}

In 1973, members of the ''Grupp 8'' in [[Gothenburg]] broke away from the organization and formed a group called ''Nyfeministerna''
(The New Feminists), as they felt the ''Grupp 8'' branch lacked focus on feminist issues and women's solidarity.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}} Simultaneously, a group of members left the Stockholm branch of ''Grupp 8'' and formed ''Arbetets kvinnor'' (Women Workers), accusing their chapter of being too feminist and not focusing enough on class struggle.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} ''Grupp 8'' nevertheless continued to be the main organization in Sweden advocating for women.{{sfn|Solheim|2000|p=52}} [[Lesbian]] women were active in ''Grupp 8'', and after 1974, in the Lesbian Front, which formed in that year.{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} In 1975, inspired by [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s ''[[Against Our Will]]'', [[Maria-Pia Boëthius]] began a series of articles in the newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' to bring the discussion of rape into the public sphere. The following year, she published ''Skylla sig själv'' (Self-blame) analyzing [[victim blaming]] by the male-dominated legal system.
{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=28–29}}

In 1976, the ''Sexualbrottsutredningen'' (Sexual Crimes Investigation), which had been commissioned by the government in 1971 was published.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=27}} The investigating committee, composed of eight men over the age of 60 and one woman,{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=28}} produced an analysis which recommended that penalties for sexual violence be minimized, that victim's behavior mitigate the severity of the crime, and that age requirements concerning sexual acts involving children be lowered, in the case of sexual touching to as low as ten years-of-age.{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=29–30}} ''Grupp 8'' immediately came out against the recommendations and encouraged other activists to follow their lead.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=30}} Organizing around 500,000 women, from thirteen women's groups, the liberationists prepared a joint statement criticizing the report. The press surrounding the outcry raised awareness on the issue, forcing the government to abandon the plan to revise statutes.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=31}}

The ''Kvinnofronten'' (Women's Front) was formed in 1977, when a large portion of the membership of ''Grupp 8'' left over what they saw as insufficient attention to the opposition to pornography. Those who joined ''Kvinnofronten'' branched across Sweden with focus on eliminating the objectification of women, providing free childcare, and a 6-hour work day.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=21}} By 1978, participation in events was declining. There were only 2,000 participants in 8 March events that year,{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} and by the early 1980s, the liberationist movement had given way.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=22}}

==Spain==
The first liberationist group to form in [[Barcelona]] began in 1970, when [[María José Ragué]] returned from an extended stay in the [[United States]] and invited women to meet in her home to discuss Women's Liberation. A similar group was formed in the home of [[Laura Tremosa]] in 1975. The women held consciousness-raising sessions in clandestine meetings which were forbidden by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=283}} Underground meetings were also held in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as early as 1974.{{sfn|Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa|2011|p=3}} Many feminist activists were also anti-Francoist activists and though they were politically left-leaning, none of the leftist parties had women's agendas nor policies which allowed for women's participation.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=284}}

The day after Franco's death, Tremosa, along with Mireia Bofil, {{ill|Amparo Moreno|es}}, and [[Núria Pompeia]], among others founded on 21 November 1975 the Asociación de Comunicación Humana y Ecología (Association for Human Communication and Ecology, ANCHE). The name was specifically chosen not to alarm authorities, but their stated goals were to create an autonomous women's liberation group.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=283}} Liberationists in general sought to redefine women's identity in Spain. A slogan "sexuality is not maternity" became popular at the beginning of the movement and women pressed for the right to have access to contraception and abortion.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=330}}

In December 1975, the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist Party]] provided support for a clandestine meeting of some 400 women in [[Madrid]], who participated in the ''Pimeras Journadas Nacionales por la Liberación de la Mujer'' (First National Conference for the Liberation of Women). The conference spawned the creation of the {{ill|Women's Liberation Front (Spain)|lt=Women's Liberation Front|es|Frente de Liberación de la Mujer}} ({{lang-es|Frente de Liberación de la Mujer (FLM)}}), which soon had 200 subgroups around the country.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}}{{sfn|Arriero Ranz|2011|pp=59–62}} Members of the FLM included [[Celia Amorós]], [[Elena Arnedo]] and [[Gloria Nielfa]]. In 1976 the ''Jornades Catalanes de la Dona'' (Catalan Conference on Women) was held at the [[University of Barcelona]] with 4,000 attendees. At the conference, ideas about women's sexuality, including the individual rights of women regarding their own bodies were introduced.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}} Soon after the conference, {{ill|Lidia Falcón|es}} founded the ''Colectivo Feminista de Barcelona'' (Feminist Collective of Barcelona){{sfn|Genderhacker|2013}} and with {{ill|Carmen Alcalde|es}}, began publishing the journal, ''{{ill|Vindicación feminist|ca}}'' (Feminist Vindication).{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=302}}

The arrest of eleven women regarding abortion in the Basque town of [[Basauri]] in September 1976, mobilized women throughout the country to demand control of their own reproductive rights, and led to the first demonstration held in Madrid since 1936.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|pp=302–303}} That same year, the ''Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa'' (Lanbroa Feminist Collective) was formed in [[Bilbao]] by {{ill|María José Urruzola|es}}.{{sfn|Mendizabal Fundarena|2001|p=140}}{{sfn|Falcon|2006}} The group's main concerns were elimination of patriarchy in educational, health, judicial and political systems, with a focus on the right to divorce and control their own reproduction.{{sfn|Colectivo Feminista Lanbroa|2011|p=3}} In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the ''Colectivo grupo Terra'' (Collective Group Terra) was formed by members seeking liberationist ideals.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}{{sfn|Aguado Higón|2011|p=341}} In 1977, feminists in the Basque Country held the ''I Journadas de la Mujer de Euskadi'' (First Conference of Basque Women) in Bilbao, identifying two main threads of feminism—those who saw women's oppression as rooted in [[sexism]] and the political feminists who wanted legal reform.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=331}}{{sfn|Mendizabal Fundarena|2001|p=140}} That same year in [[Mallorca]], the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'' (Pelvis Feminist Collective) was organized.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}

In 1978, the law restricting contraception was stricken, which was seen as a victory by liberationists.{{sfn|Bermúdez|Johnson|2018|p=330}} In 1979, a joint protest with members of the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'', ''Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona'' (Group for Women's Liberation) and ''Mujeres Independientes'' (Independent Women) was staged in Mallorca with demonstrators carrying funerary wreaths. The action brought attention to the recent deaths of three young women from [[sexual violence]], calling for an end to [[sexual abuse]] and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or [[Crime of passion|passion]] as mitigating factors for their behaviors.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1979}} The liberationist element of Spanish feminism was always the smallest sector, and the 1970s drew to a close, many of the women who had been involved in the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] began transitioning into organizations which were political.{{sfn|Gahete Muñoz|2017|p=588}}

==Switzerland==
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{lang-de|Frauenbefreiungsbewegung (FBB}}) was formed in 1969 following student protests the previous year in [[Zürich|Zurich]].{{sfn|Joris|2008}} FBB groups sprang up in [[Basel]], [[Bellinzona]], [[Bern]], [[Geneva]], [[Lausanne]], and [[Locarno]].{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} The group became loosely affiliated with similar organizations like the ''Mouvement pour la Libération de la femme'' (MLF) in French-speaking cities in the country and the ''Movimento Femminista Ticinese'' (MFT) in the [[Canton of Ticino]], an Italian-speaking area. Women affiliated with the movement challenged [[patriarchy]], the position of women in society and the double moral standard imposed upon women. Calling for free [[abortion]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] as well as day care centers,{{sfn|Joris|2008}} membership expanded rapidly.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} Women's liberation groups in Switzerland were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women.{{sfn|Kiani|2017|p=19}}

The groups took to the street, protesting and engaging in public controversies to bring attention to discrepancies between men's and women's lives, like the inability of women to vote, an education system which made housekeeping courses mandatory for women, and a ban on women's participating in the country's defense. Their first public action was a protest against [[objectification]], but they also demonstrated for equal pay, revision of the marriage laws, retraining of [[Housewife|housewives]] to enter the work force, and improved social benefits for women.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} As early as 1970, the FBB in [[Zurich]] began organizing an experimental kindergarten and unlike in other places, established a formal board.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} In 1971, the FBB and Progressive Women of Basel organized a petition drive to collect signatures to remove the criminal status from abortion.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}}

By 1972, the FBB-Zurich opened the first women's center in Switzerland, Information Center for Women ({{lang-de|Informationsstelle für Frauen (INFRA)}}). The idea for the center was proposed by a consciousness-raising group which discussed sexuality and enlightenment and the center offered counseling on abortion, contraceptives, as well as giving general information on education, alternative medicine, and legal issues. In 1974, a [[lesbian]] organization known as the ''Homosexuelle Frauengruppe'' (HFG) took space in the INFRA building and affiliated with many of the goals and projects of the FBB. The HFG published a journal and founded a women's bookshop, before formally merging with the FBB in 1980.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}} During the 1975 conference held for [[International Women's Year]] taking place in Bern, members of the FBB held a counter-conference to include issues that progressives omitted, like abortion, homosexuality, women prisoners and immigrants.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}}

FBB members were more radical than the conservative members of reformist feminist groups which emerged in their wake. In 1977, some adherents split off to join with socialist feminists. Increasingly FBB groups focused on [[violence against women]] and provided counseling services to abused women.{{sfn|Kommission für Frauenfragen|2000}} The Zurich FBB dissolved in 1989.{{sfn|Zimmermann|2007}}

==United Kingdom==
The Women's Liberation Movement in the UK was spurred not only by events occurring in the United States, but by events within the nation which forced women to think in different ways about their political lives. Two important events, the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Dagenham Ford Plant strike]] by women machinists in 1968 over pay inequality and a campaign launched the same year by women in Hull over local fishermen's safety, led to a desire for women throughout the nation to organize.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=16}} Student activists in France and the UK were involved in protests over [[Apartheid]] and the [[Vietnam War]], radicalizing them, but many women who joined leftist movement felt relegated to the sidelines.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=31–32}} Advertising for members to form local consciousness-raising groups, women brought other women to the movement and it grew rapidly.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=45}} Using U.S. [[Redstockings|Redstocking activist]], [[Kathie Sarachild]]'s articles as a guide, women learned how to analyze issues impacting their own lives and question whether those challenges were broadly effecting other women, giving each woman a personal stake in the outcome of the movement.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=47–48}}

The first [[National Women's Liberation Movement Conference]], attended by around 600 women took place in Britain, for three days, from 27 February 1970, at [[Ruskin College]].{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Cochrane|2010}} At the conference the liberationists laid out their focus areas, which included child care, equal education and opportunity, pay equity, and reproductive rights.{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}} In 1970, British feminist [[Germaine Greer]] published her book, ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'', which garnered international acclaim from feminists on an international scale.{{sfn|Wilde|Hooton|Andrews|1994|p=271}} The following year, [[Juliet Mitchell]]'s ''Woman's Estate'' was released and extracts of the book were widely disseminated and discussed in local consciousness raising sessions.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=51}} Also in 1971 the British edition of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'', originally written by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, was edited and published by [[Angela Phillips]] and [[Jill Rakusen]] in England, becoming an important text, urging women to become familiar with their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Guest|2010}} Another important text, ''The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community'' (1972) by [[Selma James]] and [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa|Mariosa Dalla Costa]] examined the place of women in terms of paid and unpaid labor.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=98}} The book led to several chapters of the [[Wages for housework]] (WFH) campaign in Britain and other countries.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=98}} Topics of relationships, marriage and sexuality were often discussed in groups, evaluating duty, domestic life and women's sphere in ways which allowed women to build confidence and share things like homosexuality or abuse, which had previously been taboo subjects.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=52–54}} Writing about women's history became very important during the WLM in the UK.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}}

Abortion was a unifying issue for liberationists throughout the nation, but while the focus throughout the UK included reproduction and contraception, in some localities, such as Scotland, the focus was solely on abortion.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=127–128}} The [[Abortion Act 1967|British Abortion Act of 1967]] was passed to eliminate unsupervised primitive and unhygienic procedures and had little to do with women's rights to govern their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=114–116}} From the emergence of the WLM in Britain activists felt the importance of shifting the debate to self-determination.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=117}} In 1975, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] (NAC) was formed to organize the push toward choice.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=119}} Distrust between NAC, unions and WLM activists led to several fissures, but despite the uneasy alliance the groups worked together and there was some fluidity with activists participating in multiple factions for the cause.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=121–122}} A series of proposals were introduced in the 1970s, starting with [[James White (Scottish politician)|James White]]’s 1975 bill to restrict abortion on the basis of gestation; [[Bill Benyon]]’s 1977 bill to not only limit abortion based upon gestation time but to give medical professionals an opt-out to refuse; and then in 1979, a bill introduced by [[John Corrie]] to restrict not only gestation but the grounds on which abortion could be attained.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=125–126}} Further complicating the debate was the paucity of [[National Health Service]] facilities throughout the UK, giving women in southern England readily available abortion centers, which were lacking in other areas of the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=128}} Though there were a wide variety of views among individual liberationists on the topic, the movement was in favor of women's autonomy over their own bodies.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=133}}

Another critical area of work during the period focused on violence against women. Out of consciousness raising sessions, women wanted to find means to combat violence and bring the problem into the public sphere.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=143}} Liberationists created the National Women's Aid Federation in 1974 and eventually branches were established in each of the four countries. The central body was critical for networking, as well as attaining government funds to assist with the work.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} In 1977, the British edition of [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s ''[[Against Our Will]]'' was published and became an influential text, showing how rape had been weaponized throughout history. In response liberationists throughout the UK worked to shift the focus away from women's behaviour toward the perpetrator. Through establishment of Rape Crisis Centres, they led the effort to provide support to victims and campaigned for change, publishing articles to increase awareness among the public.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=158}}

Conferences throughout Britain occurred at varied locations, including [[Sheffield]] (June 1970), [[Skegness]] (1971), [[Manchester]] (March 1972), London (November 1972), [[Bristol]] (1973), [[Edinburgh]] (1974), Manchester (1975), Newcastle (1976), London (1977) and [[Birmingham]] (1978).{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=82}} Though changing the location was meant to unify the women, it led to feelings in some quarters that the long journeys to nationwide conferences were marginalizing women from other parts of the country. When publications supposedly representative of all groups and subgroups in the country appeared to be London-centric, activists in the north, felt alienated.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=101–102}} At the 1974 conference of the WLM in Edinburgh two additional goals—economic and legal independence for women and the right to autonomy over their sexuality, free from discrimination—were adopted.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}} During the 1975 conference in Manchester, liberationists decided to create the [[Women’s Information and Referral Service]] (WIRES), which both produced a newsletter for women in Leeds and York, but acted as a [[news agency|news service]] to distribute information to the other groups and subgroups of liberationists throughout the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}} At the eighth and final conference, held in 1978 in Birmingham, liberationists added a demand for freedom from violence.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}}{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=104}}

By the end of the 1970s the movement had grown so large that it was difficult to sustain the personal and individual aspects which characterized the early movement. Conferences in Britain numbering near 3,000 participants made it difficult for individual activists to have a say in shaping policy or in discussions. Fragmentation on issues which were important to their personal political perspectives, was common for activists in the later part of the movement. In the drive to move from theory to action, liberationists began working on single-issue campaigns to ensure that gains which had been made were not rolled back. In addition, as the state had reformed many policies toward women and political and economic situation had shifted dramatically, activists felt a need to shift the way that they engaged with the state and public.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=181–182}}

===England===
The WLM movement emerged as groups of women took part in local campaigns or more traditional lobbies and marches in support of civil rights, peace and the [[New Left]]. Their activities were triggered by a period of rapid social and cultural change in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to WLM meetup centres in private houses and community centers, magazines, leaflets and posters were published by the women who gathered there.{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}} "Consciousness raising" groups appeared in the early 1970s, where women talked about their own life experiences together in different locations throughout [[London]].{{sfn|Barrington|2003|pp=14–16}} Women were also able to recognize the unpaid labor that women do every day, including [[Homemaking|housework]], [[emotional labor]] and care-giving.{{sfn|Stoller|2018|p=95}} The first national WLM conference took place in late February and early March 1970 at [[Oxford]]. There were more than 600 women in attendance where they discussed four primary issues: Equal pay, equal education and job opportunities, free contraception and abortion on demand and free 24 hour nurseries.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}

In November 1970, protesters went to [[Royal Albert Hall]] to protest the [[Miss World]] pageant and challenge the idea of women being judged by their physical appearance. Protesters had fliers and shouted, "We're not beautiful, we're not ugly, we're angry!"{{sfn|Robinson|2011}}{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} This protest was organised by Jane Grant and protesters threw out "leaflets, bags of flour and smoke bombs".{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} Several of the women, including [[Jenny Fortune]], who had brought a "busload of women from [[University of Essex|Essex University]]", were arrested and conducted their own defence in court.{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} The protesters, numbering around 50 or so women, were fined 100 pounds and the Women's Liberation Network paid the fines for the women.{{sfn|Peck|2011}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the protest a "galvanising moment in the women's liberation movement".{{sfn|Bindel|2011}} An earlier, smaller protest of 50 women who called themselves the Women's Liberation Workshop, had taken place the year before in 1969.{{sfn|''The Lawton Constitution''|1969|p=5}}

The Women's Liberation Network formed in [[north London]] in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Hughes|2015|p=203}} a WLM group began in [[Bolton]] in 1970 with three members, a group formed in [[Norwich]], as did one in [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=725}} Groups started publishing newsletters to inform activists of developments and by the mid-1970s most towns and cities throughout England had a group publishing about local WLM happenings. The newsletters were critical as many families still did not have home telephones.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=726}} ''[[Spare Rib]]'' was launched in July 1972 and became popular throughout the UK. Other English publications which became important included ''Shrew'', ''Women's Report'' and ''Women's Voice''.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}} Women involved in the WLM in England felt that it was a time "of enormous innocence, enthusiasm and creative power, when small groups of women were forming across the country, talking about their circumstances, and feeling the rush of recognition as they realised they weren't alone in their frustrations".{{sfn|Cochrane|2010}}

In 1972, one of the first shelters for victims of domestic violence was set up in England. It was called [[Refuge (United Kingdom charity)|Chiswick Women's Aid]] and was largely steered by [[Erin Pizzey]].{{sfn|Renzetti|Edleson|2008|p=126}} The first [[Rape crisis center|rape crisis centre]] was opened in 1973 for England and Wales.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales|2015}} The Bristol Women's Centre opened that same year and one of the services they offered was pregnancy testing, vital when no self-testing existed in the period. They also had a space to offer emergency shelter to "battered women", as victims of violence were called at the time. In other areas, women's centres became hubs for activists in the movement, for example, the centre in Norwich had meeting space for consciousness-raising groups and training, provided advice services on a variety of issues like health, housing, and marriage, as well as offering pregnancy tests. In Brighton, the women's centre, opened in 1974, was next door to the women's shelter, allowing women the pretext of going to the centre, when they were actually fleeing violence. By 1979, more than forty women's centres offered a variety of services throughout the country.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|pp=729–730}}

In 1973, black British women organised the [[Brixton Black Women's Group]] to focus on education and contraceptive issues in their community.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Black Cultural Archives|2013|p=4}}{{sfn|Agyepong|2016}} Women who were former [[British Black Panthers]], such as [[Olive Morris]], [[Beverley Bryan|Beverly Bryan]] and [[Liz Obi]], were involved in this group. The organisation was the first black women's group in the UK.{{sfn|Agyepong|2016}} Morris also helped start other women's groups such as the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative, the Black Women's Mutual Aid Group, The [[Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent]] (OWAAD) and a self-help bookstore, the Sarbarr Bookshop.{{sfn|Noha|2016}} OWAAD formed in 1978{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} and in March 1979 sponsored a conference, where around 250 met to talk about the multiple issues they faced based on their gender, race and class. Many of the members were immigrants from various British colonies and were concerned with the impact of immigration laws on their communities.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1979|p=7}} Founding a journal, ''FOWAAD,'' with the purpose of keeping women involved connected and informed, one of their first direct actions was a sit-in at [[Heathrow Airport]] to protest virginity tests given to women upon entering the UK.{{sfn|Brixton Black Women's Group|1984|pp=84–85}}

The [[Women's Aid Federation of England]] was founded by liberationists in 1974 to specifically work on the issues of domestic violence.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} The following year, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] (NAC) formed{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} to defend abortion rights, advocate for further improvements and extensions of reproductive rights, and promote awareness of family planning services and contraceptives.{{sfn|''Women's International Network News''|1991|p=25}} In June 1975, NAC staged a demonstration that attracted between 15,000 and 20,000 people.{{sfn|Potts|Diggory|Peel|1977|p=326}} NAC fought against various [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House Of Commons]]' Bills that were intended to restrict abortion rights,{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|pp=109–110}} creating alliances with organisations that worked with "other oppressed and exploited groups".{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=111}}

There were conflicts within the WLM in how they approached the subject of abortion on England.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}} Women in the WLM criticised labor unions for not going far enough in political support for free abortions on demand.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=103}} Nevertheless, the [[Trades Union Congress|Trade Union Congress]] (TUC) and the NAC along with the [[Committee in Defence of the 1967 Act]] (CoOrd) planned an October 1979 march in support of abortion rights.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}} The march was the largest pro-abortion march in the country and was part of the Campaign Against the Corrie Bill (CACB).{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=112}} The differences between the organisers of the pro-abortion march led to an "angry clash" with radical feminists from the London Women's Liberation and Women's Aid holding up the parade because they felt they, not the other organisations should lead it.{{sfn|Jolly|2014|p=103}} NAC was criticized by some feminists for working with male bureaucracies, but maintained a policy that all allies, regardless of their roots, who were working against the Corrie Bill to restrict abortion rights were critical to defeat the bill.{{sfn|Hoggart|2000|p=113}}

The [[Women's Therapy Centre]], founded to provide counseling and help with mental health issues, was established in London in 1976 by [[Susie Orbach]] and [[Luise Eichenbaum]].{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Women's Therapy Centre|2013}} To assist women with education and bring women to the movement, many WLM members taught courses with the [[Worker's Educational Association]] (WEA). Some of these began as courses on the movement and then became the foundation of university classes of women's studies. Activists in Norwich gave talks to church groups, members of the [[National Women's Register|Housewives Register]] and at [[Women's Institutes]], but in the conservative climate were less bold than activists in other areas. Brighton's liberationists ran a successful course on the issues of the movement in 1978 and were asked to re-run it the following year.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=727}}

After a [[serial rapist]] attacked and killed five women in [[West Yorkshire]] with little response from the police, liberationists in [[Leeds]] organized the Leeds Rape Crisis Centre and planned a conference to discuss violence against women.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=731}} They organized the first [[Reclaim the Night]] march in 1977 to challenge the idea that women should stay inside after dark in order to avoid rape and assault.{{sfn|Bindel|2006}} Reclaim the Night protests spread to Bolton and Brighton and a national march was held in London on 20 January 1979.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=731}} The ''Guardian'' reported in 1979 that the marches had had "little attention except for a few sneers and weak jokes".{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1979|p=11}} However, the marches took place in 12 locations in England and involved hundreds of women. Reclaim the Night inspired the [[Take Back the Night (organization)|Take Back the Night]] movement in the United States.{{sfn|Bindel|2006}}

In the late 1970s, [[Separatist feminism|revolutionary feminism]] took off in England, with more militant feminists who were inspired by a workshop and a conference paper at the National Women's Liberation Conference of 1977.{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=177}} Revolutionary liberationists tended to be separatist, adhered to a doctrine of political lesbianism and directed their actions toward pornography, sexual abuse, and sexual violence.{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=178}} They argued that "male violence against women is an expression of male supremacy and political control of women"{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=348}} and conceptualized gender as class, in which all men held the power positions and all women were the exploited class.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=343}} Increasingly, revolutionary feminists refused to engage with men, even those who engaged in similar social struggles.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|p=350}} After 1977, more women's journals and documents were known to be or designated as items to be read by women only{{sfn|Rees|2010a|p=180}} and by the 1978 nationwide conference fractures between liberationist and separatist feminists disrupted the conference and led to a collapse of the plenary session. The emotional response to the conference led to no one wanting to take on the responsibility of organizing further conferences.{{sfn|Rees|2010b|pp=350–351}}

In 1979, the [[Southall Black Sisters]] formed to address violence against women and address issues within the black and Asian communities. Based on a liberationist model, they offered consciousness-raising discussions, counseling services and information in a multi-lingual format.{{sfn|The British Library|2015}}{{sfn|Cohen|2011}} [[Sheba Feminist Press]] opened in 1980,{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} with the purpose of expanding printing services to women and translating works from other languages to English. They were accused of spreading erotica or lesbian propaganda by Conservatives in the government.{{sfn|Mackie|1981|p=2}} Through the late 1980s, a liberationist group in Norwich was continuing direct action and protest on the issues of violence against women;{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=735}} however, most liberationists by the 1980s were transitioning away from direct action and recognizing that they had to find ways to engage with local, regional and national governments and agencies.{{sfn|Bruley|2016|p=736}}

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], the idea of Women's Liberation was often bound to the [[The Troubles|Nationalist Troubles]] of the era. Difficulties in advocating for women's rights when adherence to religious norms on morality and reproduction had become politicized, created a climate where advocates often had to shift focus to maintain an apolitical stance.{{sfn|Aughey|Morrow|2014|p=173}} During the period of [[Direct rule (Northern Ireland)|Direct Rule]], it was difficult for women to unite in a single struggle against patriarchy as the entire society was divided between whether there should be a United Ireland or a United Kingdom.{{sfn|Rynder|2002|pp=44–45}} Further, as men were [[Operation Demetrius|interned]], women were increasingly involved in developing coping mechanisms to care for their families and the violence surrounding them.{{sfn|Begoña|1995}}

The [[Northern Ireland Women's Rights Movement]] (NIWRM), formed in 1975, tried to achieve neutrality by focusing on employment rights and sexism.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} As an umbrella organization with a formal charter and a mission aimed toward reforming legislation, by bringing Britain's sex discrimination laws to Northern Ireland, it was not a liberationist organization.{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}}{{sfn|Hill|McAuley|McLaughlin|Porter|2006|p=17}} However, the Women's Aid Federation, which was developed by a group of women who broke away from NIWRM,{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}} in 1977, was based on a non-hierarchical structure and formed from the Liberation Movement. Groups were autonomous and were open to all women, regardless of their political affiliation. The organizational goals were to provide refuges from family violence for women and children{{sfn|McMillan|2007|p=6-7}} and they established groups in Belfast, Coleraine and Derry, spreading to Newry, North Down and Omagh in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=889}}

Three London-based collectives working with women in Northern Ireland were the Women on Ireland Collective, Women and Ireland Group and the London-Armagh Coordinating Group. Each of these groups were autonomous organizations without a hierarchical organizational structure and affiliated with British WLM organizations, though they did not focus directly on patriarchal inequalities.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=154}} The Women on Ireland Collective formed in 1974 and existed for one year. Members were all from Northern Ireland, members of the English WLM, and their work focused on improving awareness in Britain about Northern Irish women in working-class neighborhoods.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=156}} Members worked to publicise the issues in Northern Ireland through conferences and public meetings,{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=157}} as well as through public demonstrations protesting prisoners' rights. After calling a hunger strike for two sisters, [[Marian Price|Marian]] and [[Dolours Price]], and equating the government response of their [[force-feeding]] to [[suffragette]]s who had faced similar measures, the group drew harsh criticism from other members of the WLM. The Price sisters were seen as combatants because of their involvement with bombings and the controversy led to the dissolution of the collective in 1975.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=157–158}}

The Women and Ireland Group was formed in 1976 from some of the members of the Women on Ireland Collective.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=159}} They participated in the rally held for the [[Community for Peace People|Peace People]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] in November 1976, but as opposition to the peace activists because of their support for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], as opposed to being neutral.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=158–159}} The group, like its predecessor focused on support for working class women in Northern Ireland and raising awareness among British WLM members. Branches formed in Bristol, Brighton, Dundee and Manchester and increasingly worked with women political prisoners, before dissolving in 1980.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|p=161}} London-Armagh Coordinating Group, typically known as the Armagh Group, formed in 1980 and was active through 1987. Their activities focused on women political prisoners and prisoner rights.{{sfn|Dawson|Dover|Hopkins|2017|pp=161–162}}

===Scotland===
As in other countries within the UK, the WLM emerged in [[Scotland]] in 1970.{{sfn|Breitenbach|Mackay|2010|p=153}} Student protests and the challenges to authority that emerged in the 1960s, were key to the development of Scottish activists. Specifically the challenge to [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], rector at [[Edinburgh University]], by over his opinion regarding distributing [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] at the Student Union. In what came to be known as the ''Muggeridge Affair'', [[Anna Coote]], at the time editor of the campus newspaper ''[[The Student (newspaper)|The Student]]'' and later a prominent liberationist, wrote a series of articles calling for him to resign. Coote's position was that as rector, Muggeridge should have put his personal convictions aside to support the student pro-distribution position, as he was their elected representative. In the wake of the criticism, Muggeridge resigned.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=27–28}}

Conscousness-raising groups quickly formed and spread throughout Scotland, and though they were locally based had ties to regional and national networks of other groups.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=63}} By 1970, groups had been established in [[Aberdeen]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and [[St Andrews]], and among other places were founded in [[Dundee]] and [[Shetland]] in 1972.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=64}} Groups continued to be formed throughout the 1970s, with establishments created in [[North Lanarkshire]] with members from [[Cumbernauld]] and [[Kilsyth]] assembling in 1978 and the Falkirk Area Women's Group forming in the [[Central Lowlands]] in 1979.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=66}} The first Women's Liberation conference in Scottland was held in Glasgow in 1972 and thereafter occurred annually until 1976, when it became a twice yearly event. Conference locations shifted annually to allow women from all geographical locations to be able to participate in the events and activists donated to funds to pool monies for travel.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=81–82}}

Women's health became a focus of the WLM group from Glasgow, whereas lack of adequate childcare facilities became an important issue for groups in Aberdeen, Dundee, and Edinburgh.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=68}} Other issues, such as women's objectification were addressed in direct actions, like when Edinburgh liberationists entered "Miss Conception", "Miss Fortune", "Miss Placed", "Miss Treated, and "Miss Used" in a mock beauty pageant staged in 1975.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=69}} Similar action was taken by liberationists from Aberdeen who had been omitted from the "women's fayre" hosted at the Music Hall in celebration of [[International Women's Year]].{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=70}} Activists in Dundee protested the male-only policy of the Tay Bridge Bar and sent complaints to the licensing board about the discrimination of being forced to retire to the lounge. Similar protests were held in Aberdeen, with the goal being to generate media coverage.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=71–72}} On [[Shetland]] liberationists demonstrating against the opening of a strip club in [[Lerwick]] found themselves surrounded by religious groups who supported them, though not over their issue of women's objectification.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=72}}

Scottish liberationists who focused on the issue of [[abortion]] were aware that many of the challenges to the existing law came from Scottish politicians. Because of this, they focused more on abortion than the broader issues of reproduction and contraception.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=128, 134}} The lack of facilities in Scotland which performed abortions became an issue for liberationists, as for example, women from Shetland had no access and were forced to travel to Aberdeen for services. They campaigned for [[NHS Scotland#Health Boards|Area Health Boards]] to provide facilities in each geographical area.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=129}} Members of various WLM groups published articles on how their MPs voted on the issue; distributed guides, like the Abortion Law Reform Association's booklet, ''A Woman's Right to Choose: Action Guide'';{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=133}} and performed street theatre to highlight the perils of backstreet abortions.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=130}} Fierce debate in the period, occurred at rallies hosted by anti-abortion and pro-abortion forces, polarizing society.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=131-132}}

[[Women's studies]] courses began in Aberdeen and Edinburgh in 1974 as part of an adult education initiative. Courses in Glasgow began in 1978 as part of an initiative sponsored by the [[Workers' Educational Association]] and the Extra-Mural Department of the [[University of Glasgow]]. [[Chris Aldred]], a liberationist from Aberdeen and Margaret Marshall, head of the North of Scotland District WEA designed a ten-week programme to introduce women's education to Scottish working-class women.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=77}} From 1975, Scottish women, who had up to that point relied on English publications for information about the movement, began their own initiatives. ''The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter'' began in 1975 and was published by WLM groups from Dundee and St Andrews. The ''Scottish Women's Liberation Journal'' began publication in 1977, changing its name to ''MsPrint'' the following year originated in Dundee and was printed by Aberdeen People's Press. ''Nessie'', published in St Andrews, was begun in 1979.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=86–87}}

Disagreements over ideological issues with socialist feminists were prevalent from the beginning of the movement. [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Maoism|Maoist]] feminists believed that the focus should be on [[Class conflict|class struggle]], with recognition that certain systems were biased towards male supremacy. Liberationists argued that [[socialist feminism]] failed to recognize the differences in class struggle and women's issues, which were often sidelined by focus on class.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87–89}} Socialist feminists also felt the focus on men as the enemy and the idea of women needing to separate themselves from men, led to misunderstandings and characterizations of feminists as man-haters{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87, 93}} and [[lesbian]]s, regardless of their actual sexual orientation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=91}} To many, in the period where sexuality had been a taboo topic, lesbians were seen as more "scary than scared".{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=92}} Though the movement was fluid and aimed to incorporate all women, these types of differences often led to group fractures and by the late 1970s, separate conferences were held for socialist feminists and liberationists.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=87–89}}

From the mid-1970s liberationists in Scotland focused on violence against women and reached out to other autonomous women's groups to better understand as well as combat the problem.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=170}} In 1972, activists in Edinburgh established a women's shelter to accommodate women and children.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=145}} WLM members in Glasgow opened ''Interval House'' in 1974 and that same year the groups in Aberdeen and Dundee also opened shelters.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=146}} Falkirk began planning a refuge in 1975 and opened a facility in 1976.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}} Scottish liberationists, who had shunned participation in formal politics because of their patriarchal and reformist tendencies, began to develop campaigns and organizational structures which engaged with the state in the late 1970s.{{sfn|Breitenbach|Mackay|2010|p=157}} The Scottish Women's Aid formed in 1976 from liberationist groups, but recognizing the need to attain funding for the organization, they created a formal structure. By 1977, there were fifteen women's shelters scattered across the country, in places like [[Clackmannan]], [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and [[Stirling]].{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=147}}

The first Rape Crisis Centre in the Scotland was established in 1976 and by 1979 a network linking the centers across the country was established.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=156, 159}} As Scottish women were not covered by the [[Sexual Offences Act|Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976]], survivors of rape had to either have medical evidence or a witness to the violation to file charges. In addition, marital rape was not a crime. To raise awareness on the issue, WLM members wrote articles in journals and sent letters to their MPs.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=164–165}} Beginning in 1976, liberationists participated in direct protests, such as ''Witching the Meadows'', where Edinburg's WLM members dressed as witches and hexed a particularly dangerous section of [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows Park]]. From 1977, they staged marches known as ''Reclaim the Night'' in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow to gain publicity of the dangers to women of walking after dark.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=166–167}} The last two WLM conferences in Scotland occurred in 1987 in Glasgow and 1989 in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=112}}

===Wales===
The Women's liberation movement in [[Wales]] was active in [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], but also had subgroups operating in [[Aberystwyth]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Carmarthen]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and [[Pontypridd]].{{sfn|Rolph|2002}} The 1972 publication of ''The Descent of Woman'' by Welsh feminist and author, [[Elaine Morgan]] was influential for women involved in the movement.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} In 1974, the first Welsh National Women's Liberation Conference took place in Aberystyth. In 1978, the Welsh Women's Aid federation was established,{{sfn|Cardiff Women's Aid|2016}} which was led by [[Jane Hutt]] from its founding to 1988.{{sfn|BBC|1999}} Because of the WLM, the attitude of men towards women in [[pub]]s in Wales changed, becoming less [[taboo]].{{sfn|Carradice|2011|p=200}}

The [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common Peace Camp]] started in 1981. A group of women protesting [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] marched from Cardiff to the [[RAF Greenham Common|RAF Greenham]].{{sfn|The British Library|2015}} Women left their jobs and families in order to occupy the space and fight for peace in a direct action which recognized that men were responsible for most of the world's violence. Unaligned with political groups, the women gained wide support from the media and public for their stance to non-violence.{{sfn|Southwood|1982|p=20}} [[Helen John]] was one of the founders of the occupation.{{sfn|Davenport|1982|p=6}}

"'''You'''" were chosen in 2006 as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]. The magazine set out to recognize the millions of people who anonymously contribute [[user-generated content]] to [[wikis]] and other websites such as [[Wikipedia]], [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Web 2.0|the multitudes of other websites featuring user contribution]].&lt;ref name="moty2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lev Grossman|title=Time's Person of the Year: You| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html|work=Time|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

While the status had been given before to inanimate objects, with the [[personal computer]] being the "Machine of the Year" for 1982,&lt;ref name=machine/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; as well as collections of people or an abstract representative of a movement, the choice of "You" attracted criticism from commentators in publications such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' for being too much of a [[pop culture]] [[gimmick]].&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; A ''[[New York Daily News]]'' article named the 2006 award as one of the ten most controversial "Person of the Year" moments in the history of ''Time''.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/time-magazine-10-controversial-people-year-article-1.2040428 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Time Magazine's 10 most controversial People of the Year | date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[news-magazine]] experienced generally successful sales.

==Background==
While most earlier choices for "Person of the Year" have been historically important individuals, many of them [[:wikt:infamous|infamous]] rather than internationally popular ([[Adolf Hitler]] was 1938's "Man of the Year", and [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] won in 1979),&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;&lt;ref name=photo/&gt; a few were inanimate. The [[personal computer]] was the "Machine of the Year" for 1982,&lt;ref name=machine&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19830103,00.html | work=Time | title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Computer, Machine of the Year - Jan. 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "[[Earth|Endangered Earth]]" was the "Planet of the Year" for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19890102,00.html | work=Time | title=TIME Magazine Cover: Endangered Earth, Planet of the Year - Jan. 2, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; Collections of people as well as a symbolic representative of multiple individuals had also won the award before; for example, "U.S. Scientists" were named "Men of the Year" in 1960.&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019752,00.html|publisher=''Time''|title=Person of the Year: A Photo History|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar media awards had already recognized the growing significance of online community and user-generated content: "You!" were ranked first in ''[[Business 2.0]]''{{'s}} list of "50&amp;nbsp;people who matter now" in July 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/peoplewhomatter/ |title=50 people who matter now |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[ABC News]] had listed [[blog]]gers as "People of the Year" for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=372266&amp;page=1 |title=People of the Year: Bloggers |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
In accordance with ''Time''{{'s}} annual  process, different [[news bureau|bureaus]] suggested different candidates.&lt;ref name="Koepp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/dec2006/19/behind_time_maga |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406010101/http://www.newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/dec2006/19/behind_time_maga|title=Behind Time Magazine's Choice for Person of the Year -- An Interview with Stephen Koepp |last=Cohn |first=David |date=December 19, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You", or "the [[YouTube]] guys", was floated in November as a possible winner.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/nov2006/15/time_magazine_ha Time Magazine Has an Award For "You"] by David Cohn on November 15, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; Readers' opinions were canvassed online.&lt;ref name="Koepp"/&gt; The final decision was made by [[managing editor]] [[Richard Stengel]].

The decision was announced in ''Time''{{'s}} December 13, 2006 issue.&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt;  The cover of the magazine featured an [[iMac]] computer monitor with a [[reflection (physics)|reflective]] [[BoPET|mylar]] pane appearing as the window of a [[YouTube]]-like video player, intended to reflect as online content the visage of whoever picks up the magazine.&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt;
The time remaining indicator in the image indicates a total duration of "20:06," a visual pun connecting this ubiquitous bit of interface design to the year in which it gained ascendancy in ''Time''{{'s}} view. Stories on the new user-driven media dynamic were provided by [[NBC]] editor [[Brian Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570707,00.html Enough About You], Brian Williams, Dec. 16, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Time'' magazine editors [[Lev Grossman]]&lt;ref name="moty2006"/&gt; and [[Richard Stengel]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570743,00.html Now It's Your Turn], Richard Stengel, Dec. 16, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;  As Grossman describes, "It's about the many wrestling power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes."

==Criticism==
The choice was criticized for being a short-sighted gimmick which ignored the existence of many prominent individuals that had shaped the events of the past year. Pundit [[Paul Kedrosky]] called it an "incredible cop-out", and he also speculated that the selection marked "some sort of near-term market top for user-generated content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Kedrosky | title=I Call "Market Top" on "You" | url=http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | work=Infectious Greed | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=2008-02-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207013442/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/12/16/i_call_market_t.html | archive-date=7 February 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator Kevin Friedl noted that the award and cover design recalled the [[mirror]] viewed by the protagonist, the Dude, of ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', via which the viewer's reflection was framed as ''Time''{{'s}} "Man of the Year".&lt;ref name="friedl"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, journalist David A. Graham wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that he thought ''Time'' had shown "a pattern of lackluster choices" and the overall promotional nature of the process shouldn't be treated as news, rather simply viewed as [[marketing]]. He remarked, "Is anyone out there ''not'' sick of people ironically listing 'Time Person of the Year, 2006' in Twitter bios, a reference to the gimmicky selection of 'You' that year?"&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/everyone-should-ignore-times-person-of-the-year/266462/ |title=Everyone Should Ignore Time's Person of the Year |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the decision raised some criticism as it was described as ideological and even hypocritically political. Some weeks before the announcement, ''Time'' decided to ask the users in a poll, "Who Should Be Person of the Year?"  After several weeks, the poll winner by a wide margin was [[Hugo Chávez]], the leader of [[Venezuela]], with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], came in second. ''Time'' decided to ignore those results and did not mention them in the announcement of their "Person of the Year". Its critics underlined that ''Time'' ignores its [[digital democracy]] among its readers. ''Time'' supporters argue that an online poll is not representative as it has no scientific value. The [[Universal Resource Locator|hyperlink]] to the online poll results has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chavez wins "Person of the Year" poll ... Time magazine ignores result | url=http://www.handsoffvenezuela.org/time-hugo-chavez-award.htm | work=Hands Off Venezuela | date=18 December 2006 | accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 ''[[New York Daily News]]'' article, which named the "You" naming as one of the ten most controversial "Person of the Year" moments in the history of ''Time'', also remarked that "2006 had its fair share of newsmakers" while highlighting both "Venezuela President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad".&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;
