[[File:5S methodology.png|thumb|upright=1.3|5S methodology.]]
[[File:Resource corner 5S Safety Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|5S resource corner at Scanfil Poland factory in [[Sieradz]].]]
'''5S''' is a workplace organization method that uses a list of five [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words: {{nihongo|''seiri''|整理}}, {{nihongo|''seiton''|整頓}}, {{nihongo|''seisō''|清掃}}, {{nihongo|''seiketsu''|清潔}}, and {{nihongo|''shitsuke''|躾}}. These have been translated as "Sort", "Set In  order", "Shine", "Standardize" and "Sustain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S? - Sort, Set In Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.

In some quarters, 5S has become 6S, the sixth element being safety.&lt;ref&gt;Gapp, R., Fisher, R., Kobayashi, K. 2008. Implementing 5S within a Japanese Context: An Integrated Management System, ''Management Decision''. 46(4): 565-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as ''visual control'',&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Chris A. and Park, Murry. 2010. ''Visual Controls: Applying Visual Management to the Factory''. New York: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''visual workplace'',&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn D. 2005. ''Visual Workplace: Visual Thinking''. Portland, Ore: Visual-Lean Enterprise Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''visual factory''.&lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel. 1989. ''The Visual Factory: Building Participation through Shared Information''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki, ed. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Under those (and similar) terminologies, Western companies were applying underlying concepts of 5S before publication, in English, of the formal 5S methodology. For example, a workplace-organization photo from Tennant Company (a Minneapolis-based manufacturer) quite similar to the one accompanying this article appeared in a manufacturing-management book in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. 1986. ''World Class Manufacturing: The Lessons of Simplicity Applied''. New York: Free Press, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of 5S ==
[[File:The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool", CIT, Russia, 1920-1924.png|thumb|The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool" from a CIT instruction sheet, 1920-1924.]]

5S was developed in Japan and was identified as one of the techniques that enabled [[Just in time (business)|Just in Time]] manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major frameworks for understanding and applying 5S to business environments have arisen, one proposed by Osada, the other by Hirano.&lt;ref name="5-pillars"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace|last=Hirano|first=Hiroyuki|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56327-047-5|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osada"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll-1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;dq=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC8OXB0abVAhXFeD4KHWBTBZAQ6AEIKDAA|title=The 5S’s: Five keys to a Total Quality Environment|last=Osada|first=Takashi|publisher=Asian Productivity Organization &lt;!--|123= 9283311167--&gt;|year=1995|isbn=978-9-28331-115-7|location=US|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hirano provided a structure to improve programs with a series of identifiable steps, each building on its predecessor. As noted by John Bicheno,&lt;ref name="lean-toolbox"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Lean Toolbox: Towards Fast, Flexible Flow|last=Bicheno|first=John|publisher=PICSIE|isbn=978-0-9541244-1-0|location=Buckingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota's adoption of the Hirano approach was '4S', with Seiton and Seiso combined.{{Verify source|date=February 2016}}

A precursor development to the Japanese system of management was outlined by [[Aleksei Gastev|Alexey Gastev's]] development and the [[Central Institute of Labour]] (CIT) in Moscow.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="WorkManagingRusJap"&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/managing-modernity-work-community-and-authority-in-late-industrializing-japan-and-russia/oclc/231965117 Managing «modernity»: work, community, and authority in late-industrializing Japan and Russia, Rudra Sil, Publisher: Ann Arbor, Mich. : University of Michigan Press, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 5S ==
There are five 5S phases. They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain". Other translations are possible.

===Sort (Seiri)===
[[File:Red Tag Area 0123.jpg|thumb|1S – a red tag area containing items waiting for removal.]]
Seiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all unnecessary items from the location.

Goals:
* Reduce time loss looking for an item by reducing the number of items.
* Reduce the chance of distraction by unnecessary items.
* Simplify inspection.
* Increase the amount of available, useful space.
* Increase safety by eliminating obstacles.

Implementation:
* Check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their presence at the location is useful or necessary.
* Remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a 'red tag area' so that they are easy to remove later on.
* Keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in use to production.

===Set in order (Seiton) ===
[[File:5S ręczny wózek paletowy.jpg|thumb|2S – simple floor marking.]]
Seiton is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for fulfilling their function in the workplace.

Goal:
* Make the [[workflow]] smooth and easy.

Implementation:
* Arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling / equipment is in close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted to the work performed. Place components according to their uses, with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace.
* Arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items.
* Assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is easy to spot missing items.

===Shine (Seiso)===
[[File:Cleanliness point 5S Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|3S – cleanliness point with cleaning tools and resources.]]
Seiso is sweeping or cleaning and inspecting the workplace, tools and machinery on a regular basis.

Goals:
* Prevent deterioration.
* Keep the workplace safe and easy to work in.
* Keep the workplace clean and pleasing to work in.
* When in place, anyone not familiar to the environment must be able to detect any problems within 50 feet in 5 sec.

Implementation:
* Clean the workplace and equipment on a daily basis, or at another appropriate (high frequency) cleaning interval.
* Inspect the workplace and equipment while cleaning.

===Standardize (Seiketsu) ===
Seiketsu is to standardize the processes used to sort, order and clean the workplace.

Goal:
* Establish procedures and schedules to ensure the repetition of the first three ‘S’ practices.

Implementation:
* Develop a work structure that will support the new practices and make it part of the daily routine.
* Ensure everyone knows their responsibilities of performing the sorting, organizing and cleaning.
* Use photos and visual controls to help keep everything as it should be.
* Review the status of 5S implementation regularly using audit checklists.

===Sustain/Self-discipline (Shitsuke) ===
Shitsuke or sustain the developed processes by self-discipline of the workers. Also translates as "do without being told".

Goal:
* Ensure that the 5S approach is followed.

Implementation:
* Organize training sessions.
* Perform regular audits to ensure that all defined standards are being implemented and followed.
* Implement improvements whenever possible. Worker inputs can be very valuable for identifying improvements.
* When issues arrise, identify their cause and implement the changes necessary to avoid their recurral.

== Variety of 5S applications ==
5S methodology has expanded from manufacturing and is now being applied to a wide variety of industries including health care, education, and government. Visual management and 5S can be particularly beneficial in health care because a frantic search for supplies to treat an in-trouble patient (a chronic problem in health care) can have dire consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark. 2012. ''Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement''. Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the origins of the 5S methodology are in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5stoday.com/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it can also be applied to [[knowledge economy]] work, with information, software, or media in the place of physical product.&lt;ref name="ceiton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/company/profile.html#Origin|title=CEITON – Profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5S in lean product &amp; process development ==
The output of engineering and design in a lean enterprise is information, the theory behind using 5S here is "Dirty, cluttered, or damaged surfaces attract the eye, which spends a fraction of a second trying to pull useful information from them every time we glance past. Old equipment hides the new equipment from the eye and forces people to ask which to use"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward|first1=Allen|title=Lean Product and Process Development|date=March 2014|publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-43-4|page=215|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alobha''' (Sanskrit, Pali; Tibetan Wylie: ''ma chags pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-attachment". It is defined as the absence of attachment or desire towards worldly things or worldly existence. It causes one to not engage in unwholesome actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 536-537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is alobha? It is not to be attached to a mode of life and all that is involved with it. It functions in providing the basis for not being caught up in non-virtuous action.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

An '''alternative lifestyle''' is a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] diverse in respect to [[mainstream]] ones, or generally perceived to be outside the cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. ''Lifestyle'' is a [[media culture]] term derived from the concept of [[style in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. ''Introduction'', in [[Adorno]] ''[[Culture industry]]'' p.35 quotation: {{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and ‘different’ commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative ‘life-styles’.&lt;br&gt;
‘Life-styles’, the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, but not always, it implies an affinity or identification within some matching [[subculture]] (e.g. [[hippies]], [[Goth subculture|goths]] and [[Punk subculture|punks]]). Some people with alternative lifestyles mix elements from various subcultures ([[grunge]] musicians were often influenced by a mixture of the [[punk subculture|punk]], [[acid rock|hippie]], [[emo]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subcultures).

Not all minority lifestyles are held{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to be "alternative", so the term tends to apply to newer forms of lifestyle, often based upon enlarged freedoms (especially in the sphere of social styles), or a decision to substitute another approach, or to not follow the usual expected path in most societies.

== History ==
Alternative lifestyles and subcultures originated in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=f5rLCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+flapper+women&amp;ots=kv9L6jn-h-&amp;sig=8djPjwlb-1GHEYp_SKWp-gpfLsE#v=snippet&amp;q=flapper&amp;f=false|title=Modern women on trial: Sexual transgression in the age of the flapper|last=Bland|first=Lucy|date=2013-09-30|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781847798961|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} with the "[[flapper]]" movement, when women cut their hair and skirts short (as a symbol of freedom from oppression and the old way of living). Women in the flapper age were the first large group of females to practice pre-marital sex, dancing, cursing, and driving in modern America without scandal following them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A [[Stanford University]] cooperative house, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160730005004/http://web.stanford.edu/group/synergy/ Synergy], was founded in 1972 with the theme of "exploring alternative lifestyles."

==Examples ==

{{Tort law}}
The '''attractive nuisance doctrine''' applies to the [[law]] of [[torts]], in the United States. It states that a [[Land tenure|landowner]] may be held [[liable]] for [[Injury|injuries]] to [[children]] [[trespass]]ing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"/&gt;  The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotten|first1=Doyice|last2=Wolohan|first2=John T.|title=Law for Recreation and Sport Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YO80DTGw1MEC&amp;pg=PA208|accessdate=9 November 2014|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=9780787299682|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by [[abandoned car]]s, piles of [[lumber]] or [[sand]], [[trampoline]]s, and [[swimming pool]]s. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.

There is no set cut off point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each "child" on case by case basis to see if the "child" qualifies as a youth.

If it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.&lt;ref&gt;Holland V. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. 431 A.2d 597 (D.C. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the old [[common law]], the [[plaintiff]] (either the child, or a parent suing on the child's behalf) had to show that it was the hazardous condition itself which lured the child onto the landowner's property. However, most jurisdictions have statutorily altered this condition, and now require only that the injury was foreseeable by the landowner.

==Conditions==
According to the [[Restatement of Torts]] standard, which is followed in many jurisdictions, there are five conditions that must be met for a [[Property|land owner]] to be liable for tort damages to a child trespasser as a result of '''artificial''' hazards.

*The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and
*The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious [[bodily harm]] to such children,
*The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it
*The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and
*The possessor fails to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children

(See Restatement of Torts §339)

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

Research shows that the democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government. Those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J. Rummel |author-link=R. J. Rummel |title=Power kills: democracy as a method of nonviolence |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States U.S.A |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-56000-297-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and that parliamentary systems, political stability and [[freedom of the press]] are all associated with lower corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lederman, Norman Loayza, &amp; Rodrigo Res Soares, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=632777 "Accountability and Corruption: Political Institutions Matter"], World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2708  (November 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  One study has concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate [[political freedom]]. The nations with the least amount of [[terrorism]] are the most and least democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2012-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919050732/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |archivedate=2015-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P.

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful world of the very late 20th century—the world of [[NAFTA]] and an expanding [[NATO]]; of the World Wide Web 1.0 and liberal interventionism; of the global spread of democracy under leaders such as [[Václav Havel]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]—now looks battered and delusive."&lt;ref name="Frum-liberalism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frum |first1=David |title=The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism |journal=Atlantic |date=November 2018 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-case-for-liberal-republicanism/570790/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote that Fukuyama's idea of liberalism vanquishing authoritarianism "now looks like a quaint artifact of a vanished unipolar moment",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; and Fukuyama himself expressed concern.&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"/&gt;  By 2018 only one Arab Spring uprising — in Tunisia — resulted in a transition to constitutional democratic governance,&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"/&gt; and a "resurgence of authoritarianism and [[Islamic extremism]]" in the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yun Ru Phua |url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/03/30/after-every-winter-comes-spring-tunisias-democratic-flowering/ |title=After Every Winter Comes Spring: Tunisia’s Democratic Flowering – Berkeley Political Review |publisher=Bpr.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dubbed the "[[Arab Winter]]".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/9753123/Middle-East-review-of-2012-the-Arab-Winter.html |title=Middle East review of 2012: the Arab Winter | work = The Telegraph |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = The Jerusalem Post | url = http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Analysis-Arab-Winter-is-coming-to-Baghdad-359348 |title = Analysis: Arab Winter is coming to Baghdad | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2014/April/Expert-Warns-of-Americas-Coming-Arab-Winter/ |title=Expert Warns of America's Coming 'Arab Winter' |publisher=CBN |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-arab-winter |title= The Arab Winter|work= The New Yorker | accessdate = October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spu.edu/about-spu/news/articles/2014/may/arab-spring |title= Arab Spring or Arab Winter?| publisher= The New Yorker | accessdate= October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations offered for the new spread of authoritarianism by supporters include excessive immigration into European and Western countries, and the "primary and existential fear" of the "surrender" by liberal democracy of "national sovereignty and independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BUCHANAN |first1=PATRICK J. |title=Why the Authoritarian Right is on the Rise, |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/why-the-authoritarian-right-is-on-the-rise/ |website=American Conservative |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit  the downside of globalization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bhagavan |first1=Manu |title=We are witnessing the rise of global authoritarianism on a chilling scale |url=https://qz.com/643497/we-are-witnessing-the-rise-of-global-authoritarianism-on-a-chilling-scale/ |website=Qz.com |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the success of the [[Beijing Consensus]], i.e. the authoritarian model of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-success"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=China's Success Explains Authoritarianism's Allure |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/china-s-success-explains-authoritarianism-s-allure?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In at least one country, (the U.S.) factors blamed for the  growth of authoritarianism include the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and slower real wage growth;&lt;ref name="Cowen-2017-why"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Why is authoritarianism on the rise? |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/04/why-is-authoritarianism-on-the-rise.html |website=marginalrevolution.com |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media's elimination of "gatekeepers" of knowledge, so that a large fraction of the population considers to be opinion what were once "viewed as verifiable facts” – everything from the danger of global warming to the preventing the spread of disease through vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America (Review of Cass Sunstein book ''Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America'') |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=8 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71809">The '''behavioral analysis of child development''' originates from [[John B. Watson]]'s [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1926). What the nursery has to say about instincts. In C. Murchison (Eds.) ''Psychologies of 1925''. Worchester, MA: Clark University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson studied child development, looking specifically at development through conditioning (see [[Little Albert experiment]]). He helped bring a natural science perspective to child psychology by introducing objective research methods based on observable and measurable behavior. [[B.F. Skinner]] then further extended this model to cover [[operant conditioning]] and [[verbal behavior]]. Skinner was then able to focus these research methods on feelings and how those emotions can be shaped by a subject’s interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974).

New York: The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Bijou (1955) was the first to use this methodological approach extensively with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year= 1955 |title=A systematic approach to an experimental analysis of young children |journal=Child Development |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=161–168 |pmid=13261293 |doi=10.2307/1126106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year=1957 |title=Patterns of reinforcement and resistance to extinction in young children |journal=Child Development |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |pmid=13404656 |doi=10.2307/1125999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year=1958 |title=Operant extinction after fixed-interval schedules with young children |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–29 |pmid=16811199 |pmc= 1403884 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1958.1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1948, [[Sidney Bijou]] took a   position as associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington and served as director of the university’s Institute of Child Development. Under his leadership, the Institute added a child development clinic, nursery school classrooms, and a research lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Edward K.|title=Sidney W. Bijou: The Illinois Years, 1965-1975|journal=Behavior Anal.|date=Fall 2008|volume=31|issue=2|pages=179–203|pmc=2591757|pmid=22478510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bijou began working with [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baer |first=D.M. |year=1993 |title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=569–572 |pmid=16795815 |pmc=1297894 |doi= 10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569}}&lt;/ref&gt; applying [[behavior analytic]] principles to child development in an area referred to as "Behavioral Development" or "Behavior Analysis of Child Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bijou, S.W. |author2=Baer, D.M. |year=1961 |title=Child Development: Vol. 1: a Systematic and Empirical Theory |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-130377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's behavioral approach and Kantor's interbehavioral approach were adopted in Bijou and Baer's model. They created a three-stage model of development (e.g., basic, foundational, and societal). Bijou and Baer looked at these socially determined stages, as opposed to organizing behavior into change points or cusps ([[behavioral cusp]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |title=The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=244–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the behavioral model, development is considered a behavioral change. It is dependent on the kind of stimulus and the person’s behavioral and learning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baer |first=D.M. |year=1982 |title=Behavior analysis and developmental psychology: Discussant comments |journal=Human Development |volume=25 |pages=357–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis in child development takes a mechanistic, contextual, and pragmatic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Morris |first=E.K. |year=1988 |title=Contextualism: The worldview of behavior analysis |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=289–323 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(88)90063-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schlinger |first=H.D. |year=2004 |title=The almost blank slate: Making a case for human nurture |journal=Skeptic |volume=11 |pages=34–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, the behavioral model has focused on prediction and control of the developmental process.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, D.M. (1973). The control of developmental process: Why wait? In J.R. Nesselrode &amp; H.W. Reese (Eds.) ''Life Span Developmental Psychology: Methodological Issues''.

''Learning'' (fourth edition). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The model was changed after [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] studied the [[matching law]] of choice behavior developed by studying of reinforcement in the natural environment. More recently, the model has focused more on behavior over time and the way that behavioral responses become repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=E.K. |last2=Hursch |first2=D.E. |year=1982 |title=Behavior analysis and developmental psychology: Metatheoretical considerations |journal=Human Development |volume=25 |pages=344–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become concerned with how behavior is selected over time and forms into stable patterns of responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reese |first=H.W. |year=2005 |title=A Conceptual Analysis of Selectionism: Parts I and II. |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Vyse |first=S. |year=2004 |title=Stability over time: Is behavior analysis a trait psychology? |journal=The Behavior Analyst |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=43–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed history of this model was written by Pelaez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pelaez |year=1998 |title=Behavior analysis of development: History, theory, and research |journal=Mexican Journal of Behavior Analysis |volume=24 |pages=85–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Henry D. Schlinger, Jr. provided the first behavior analytic text since Bijou and Baer comprehensively showed how behavior analysis—a natural science approach to human behavior—could be used to understand existing research in child development.&lt;ref name= "Schlinger, H.D. 1995"/&gt; In addition, the quantitative behavioral developmental model by Commons and Miller is the first behavioral theory and research to address notion similar to stage.&lt;ref&gt;''Behavioral Development Bulletin'', 13 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods==

The methods used to analyze behavior in [[child development]] are based on several types of measurements. [[Single-subject research]] with a [[longitudinal study]] follow-up is a commonly-used approach. Current research is focused on integrating [[single-subject design]]s through meta-analysis to determine the effect sizes of behavioral factors in development. Lag sequential analysis has become popular for tracking the stream of behavior during observations. Group designs are increasingly being used. Model construction research involves [[latent growth modeling]] to determine developmental trajectories and [[structural equation modeling]]. [[Rasch model|Rasch analysis]] is now widely used to show sequentiality within a developmental trajectory.

A recent methodological change in the behavioral analytic theory is the use of observational methods combined with lag sequential analysis can determine [[reinforcement]] in the natural setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=Patterson |first2=G.R. |year=1986 |title=The effects of consequences on patterns of social interaction: A quasi-experimental approach to [[reinforcement]] in the natural environment |journal=Child Development |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1257–1268 |pmid=3769609 |doi=10.2307/1130448 |jstor=1130448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantitative behavioral development===

The [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is a quantitative analytic theory of development. This model offers an explanation for why certain tasks are acquired earlier than others through developmental sequences and gives an explanation of the biological, cultural, organizational, and individual principles of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Commons|first=M.L.|title=Formal, systematic, and metasystematic operations with a balance-beam task series: A reply to Kallio's claim of no distinct systematic stage|journal=Adult Development|year=1995|volume=2|issue=3|pages=193–199|doi=10.1007/bf02265717|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on explicit and mathematical measurements of behavior.

===Contingencies, uncertainty, and attachment===
The behavioral model of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] recognizes the role of uncertainty in an infant and the child’s limited communication abilities. Contingent relationships are instrumental in the behavior analytic theory, because much emphasis is put on those actions that produce parents’ responses.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"&gt;Cavell, T.A. &amp; Strand, P.S. (2002). Parent-Based interventions for aggressive, antisocial children: Adapting to a bilateral lens. In L. Kuczynski (Ed.) ''Handbook of dynamics in parent-child relations''. (pp. 395–419). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gewirtz, J.L. 1991 pp. 123"&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. &amp; Peláez-Nogueras, M. (1991). The attachment metaphor and the conditioning of infant separation protests. In J.L. Gewirtz &amp; W.M. Kurtines (Eds.), ''Intersections with attachment''. (pp. 123–144).

''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A Developmental analysis and model for intervention''. APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of contingency appears to be highlighted in other developmental theories,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.S. (1979). Perception of contingency as a determinant of social responsiveness. In E.B. Thoman (Ed.), Origins of the infant's social responsiveness. In E.B. Thoman (Ed.) ''Origins of the infant's social responsiveness''. (pp. 33–64). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; but the behavioral model recognizes that contingency must be determined by two factors:&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. &amp; Boyd, E.F. (1977). Experiments on mother-infant interaction underlying mutual attachment acquisition: The infant conditions the mother. In T. Alloway, P. Plinger &amp; L. Krames (Eds.). ''Attachment behavior''. (pp. 109–143). New York: Plenum Press&lt;/ref&gt; the efficiency of the action and that efficiency compared to other tasks that the infant might perform at that point. Both infants and adults function in their environments by understanding these contingent relationships. Research has shown that contingent relationships lead to emotionally satisfying relationships.&lt;ref name="Dunst 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Raab |first2=M. |last3=Trivette |first3=C.M. |last4=Parkey |first4=C. |last5=Gatens |first5=M. |last6=Wilson |first6=L.L.

Since 1961, behavioral research has shown that there is relationship between the parents’ responses to separation from the infant and outcomes of a “stranger situation.”.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. (1961). A learning analysis of the effects of normal stimulation, privation, and deprivation on the acquisition of social motivation and attachment. In B.M. Foss (Ed.), ''Determinants of infant behaviour''. (pp. 213–229). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done in 2000, six  infants participated in a classic reversal design (see [[single-subject research]]) study that assessed infant approach rate to a stranger. If attention was based on stranger avoidance, the infant avoided the stranger. If attention was placed on infant approach, the infant approached the stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J. &amp; Pelaez-Nogueras, M. (2000). Infant emotions under the positive-reinforcer control of caregiver attention and touch. In J.C. Leslie &amp; D. Blackman (Eds.), ''Issues in Experimental and Applied Analysis of Human Behavior''. (pp. 271–291). Reno, NV: Context Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent meta-analytic studies of this model of attachment based on contingency found a moderate effect of contingency on attachment, which increased to a large effect size when the quality of reinforcement was considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kassow |first=D.Z. |last2=Dunst |first2=C.J. |year=2004 |title=Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol2_no4.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research on contingency highlights its effect on the development of both pro-social and anti-social behavior.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Herring |first2=M. |last3=Edwards |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=[[Coregulation]] of balance between children's prosocial approaches and acts of compliance: A pathway to mother–child cooperation? |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=473–478 |pmid=11708235 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3004_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Bellamy |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=Generating reciprocity with conduct problem children and their mothers: The effectiveness of compliance teaching and responsive parenting |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships (Special issue: Reciprocity and Bidirectionality) |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=549–564 |doi=10.1177/0265407597144009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Smith |first2=G.G. |year=1999 |title=Effective parenting as the integration of lessons and dialogue |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=135–149 |doi=10.1023/A:1022031716547}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can also be furthered by training parents to become more sensitive to children’s behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2004 |title=Characteristics of interventions promoting parental sensitivity to child behavior |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analytic research supports the notion that attachment is operant-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2008 |title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=40–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An infant's sensitivity to contingencies can be affected by biological factors and environment changes. Studies show that being placed in erratic environments with few contingencies may cause a child to have conduct problems and may lead to depression. (see Behavioral Development and Depression below).&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, R.B. (1979). ''The analysis of social interaction: Methods, issues, and illustrations.''

New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues to look at the effects of learning-based attachment on [[moral development]]. Some studies have shown that erratic use of contingencies by parents early in life can produce devastating long-term effects for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, M.L. (1991).

===Motor development===
Since Watson developed the theory of behaviorism, behavior analysts have held that [[motor development]] represents a conditioning process. This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate [[reflexes]]. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not "continuous". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, [[Esther Thelen]] was  able to show that children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Savelsbergh |first=G.J.P. |year=2005 |title=Discovery Of Motor Development: A Tribute To Esther Thelen |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=243–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thelen |first=E. |last2=Fisher |first2=D.M. |year= 1982 |title=Newborn stepping: An explanation for a 'disappearing reflex{{'-}} |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=760–775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.18.5.760}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.

Infants [[relative deprivation|deprived]] of physical [[stimulation]] or the opportunity to respond were found to have delayed motor development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |year=1960 |title=Causes of retardation among institutional children: Iran |journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology |volume=96 |pages=47–59 |pmid=13815945 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1960.10534274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |last2=Najarian |first2=P. |year=1957 |title=Infant development under environmental handicap |journal=Psychological Monograph |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1037/h0093705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under conditions of extra stimulation, the motor behavior of these children rapidly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sayegh |first=Y. |last2=Dennis |first2=W. |year=1965 |title=The effects of supplementary experience upon behavioral development of infants in institutions |journal=Child Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=81–90 |pmid=14296799 |doi=10.2307/1126782 |jstor=1126782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that the use of a treadmill can be beneficial to children with motor delays including [[Down syndrome]] and cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masiello |first=T. |last2=Tucker |year=2006 |title=Influences of treadmill training on the motor development of infants with and without disabilities |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on opportunity to respond and the building of motor development continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2005 |title=A Brief Report: Can Contingent Imitation Reinforce Truck Lifting In A Three-Month-Old Infant? |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=229–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dziewolska |first=H. |last2= Cautilli |first2=J.D. |year= 2006 |title=The Effects of a Motor Training Package on Minimally Assisted Standing Behavior in a Three-Month-Old Infant |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=111–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2006 |title=Brief Report: The Use of Opportunity to Respond and Practice to increase efficiency of the stepping reflex in a five-month-old infant |url= |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=538–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavioral development model of motor activity has produced a number of techniques, including [[operant]]-based [[biofeedback]] to facilitate development with success. Some of the stimulation methods such as operant-based biofeedback have been applied as treatment to children with [[cerebral palsy]] and even spinal injury successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Ince, L.; Brucker, B. &amp; Alba A.

Skinner]] was one of the first psychologists to take the role of imitation in verbal behavior as a serious mechanism for acquisition.&lt;ref name="Skinner57"/&gt; He identified echoic behavior as one of his basic verbal operants, postulating that verbal behavior was learned by an infant from a verbal community. Skinner's account takes verbal behavior beyond an intra-individual process to an inter-individual process. He defined verbal behavior as "behavior reinforced through the mediation of others".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957), page 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] refuted Skinner’s assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomsky |first=N. |last2=Skinner |first2=B.F. |year=1959 |title=Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26–58 |doi=10.2307/411334 |jstor= 411334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the behavioral model, the child is prepared to contact the contingencies to "join" the listener and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |last2=Keohane |first2=D. |year=2006 |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior in Children |journal=Slp- Aba |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=111–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very core, verbal episodes involve the rotation of the roles as speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reese |first=H.W. |year=2004 |title=Private Speech and Other Forms of Self-Communication |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=182–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (1957).

Conversational units is a measure of socialization because they consist of verbal interactions in which the exchange is reinforced by both the speaker and the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |last2=Ross |first2=D.E. |year=2004 |title=Verbal behavior analysis: A program of research in the induction and expansion of complex verbal behavior |journal=Journal of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention |url= |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=141–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.C.

===Development of self===
Robert Kohelenberg and Mavis Tsai (1991) created a behavior analytic model accounting for the development of one’s “self”.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R. &amp; Tsai, M. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Their model proposes that verbal processes can be used to form a stable sense of who we are through behavioral processes such as [[stimulus control]]. Kohlenberg and Tsai developed [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] to treat psychopathological disorders arising from the frequent invalidations of a child’s statements such that “I” does not emerge.
Other behavior analytic models for personality disorders exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nelson-Gray |first=R.O. |last2=Mitchell |first2=J.T. |last3=Kimbrel |first3=N.A. |last4=Hurst |first4=R.M. |year=2007 |title=The Development and Maintenance of Personality Disorders: A Behavioral Perspective |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=443–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; They trace out the complex biological–environmental interaction for the development of avoidant and borderline personality disorders. They focus on [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory]], which states that some individuals are more or less sensitive to reinforcement than others. Nelson-Grey views problematic response classes as being maintained by reinforcing consequences or through rule governance.

===Socialization===
Over the last few decades, studies have supported the idea that contingent use of [[reinforcement]] and [[punishment]] over extended periods of time lead to the development of both pro-social and anti-social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eisenberg, N. |author2=Wolchik, S.A. |author3=Goldberg, L. |author4=Engel, I. |year=1992 |title=Parental values, reinforcement, and young children's prosocial behavior: a longitudinal study |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=19–36 |pmid=1645156 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1992.10753699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371–91"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, J.J. |author2=Patterson, G.R. |year=1995 |title=Individual differences in social aggression: a test of a reinforcement model of socialization in the natural environment |journal=Behav Ther |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=371–91 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(05)80111-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson, G.R. |year=2002 |title=Etiology and treatment of child and adolescent antisocial behavior |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=133–45 |url=http://behavior-analyst-today.com/VOL-3/BAT-3-2.pdf |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research has shown that reinforcement is more effective than punishment when teaching behavior to a child. It has also been shown that modeling is more effective than “preaching” in developing pro-social behavior in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N.H. |year=1970 |title=Impact of words and deeds concerning altruism upon children |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=747–759 |doi=10.2307/1127221 |jstor=1127221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N. |year=1970 |title=Preaching and practicing generosity: Children's action and reaction |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=329–353 |doi=10.2307/1127035 |jstor=1127035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards have also been closely studied in relation to the development of social behaviors in children.

The development of social skills in children is largely affected in that classroom setting by both teachers and peers. Reinforcement and punishment play major roles here as well.

Behavioral principles have also been researched in emerging peer groups, focusing on status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coie |first=J.D. |last2=Kupersmidt |first2=J.B. |year=1983 |title=A Behavioral Analysis of Emerging Social Status in Boys' Groups. |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1400–1416 |doi=10.2307/1129803 |jstor=1129803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it takes different social skills to enter groups than it does to maintain or build one’s status in groups. Research also suggests that neglected children are the least interactive and aversive, yet remain relatively unknown in groups. 
Children suffering from social problems do see an improvement in social skills after [[behavior therapy]] and [[behavior modification]]  (see [[applied behavior analysis]]). Modeling has been successfully used to increase participation by shy and withdrawn children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jakibuchuk |first=Z. |last2=Smeriglio |first2=V.L. |year=1976 |title=The influence of symbolic modeling on the social behavior of preschool children with low levels of social responsiveness |journal=Child Development |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=838–841 |doi=10.2307/1128203 |jstor=1128203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaping of socially desirable behavior through [[positive reinforcement]] seems to have some of the most positive effects in children experiencing social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0033226 |author=O'Connor, R.D. |year=1972 |title=Relative efficacy of modeling, shaping, and the combined procedure for the modification of social withdrawal |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=327–334 |pmid=5033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-social behavior===
In the development of [[anti-social behavior]], [[etiology|etiological models]] for anti-social behavior show considerable correlation with [[negative reinforcement]] and response matching (see [[matching law]]).&lt;ref name= "Patterson02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J. |last2=Stoolmiller |first2=M. |last3=Patterson |first3=G.R. |last4=Schrepferman |first4=L. |last5=Oeser |first5=J. |last6=Johnson |first6=K. |last7= Soetaert |first7=D. |year=2003 |title=The Application of Response Allocation Matching to Understanding Risk Mechanisms in Development: The Case of Young Children's Deviant Talk and Play, and Risk for Early-Onset Antisocial Behavior |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=435–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aversives|Escape conditioning]], through the use of coercive behavior, has a powerful effect on the development and use of future anti-social tactics. The use of anti-social tactics during conflicts can be negatively reinforced and eventually seen as functional for the child in moment to moment interactions.&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371–91"/&gt;
Anti-social behaviors will also develop in children when imitation is reinforced by social approval. If approval is not given by teachers or parents, it can often be given by peers. An example of this is swearing. Imitating a parent, brother, peer, or a character on TV, a child may engage in the anti-social behavior of swearing. Upon saying it they may be reinforced by those around them which will lead to an increase in the anti-social behavior. 
The role of [[stimulus control]] has also been extensively explored in the development of anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J.B. &amp; Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder (Eds.) ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for interventions''. APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent behavioral focus in the study of anti-social behavior has been a focus on rule-governed behavior. While correspondence for saying and doing has long been an interest for behavior analysts in normal development and typical socialization, recent conceptualizations have been built around families that actively train children in anti-social rules, as well as children who fail to develop rule control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osnes |first=P.G. |last2=Adelinis |first2=J. |year=2005 |title=Correspondence Training, Rule Governance, Generalization, and Stimulus Control: Connections or Disconnections? |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=48–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bevill-Davis Alicia |author2=Clees Tom J. |author3=Gast David L. |year=2004 |title= Correspondence Training: A Review of the Literature |journal=JEIBI |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peleaz |first=M. |last2=Moreno |first2=R. |year=1998 |title=A taxonomy of rules and their correspondence in rule governed behavior |journal=Mexican Journal of Behavior Analysis |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=McEachern |first2=A. |last3=Schrepferman |first3=L. |last4=Zettle |first4=R. |last5=Johnson |first5=K. |last6= Swink |first6=N. |last7=McAlpine |first7=C. |year=2006 |title=Rule-Governance, Correspondence Training, and Discrimination Learning: A Developmental Analysis of Covert Conduct Problems |journal=Slp-Aba |volume= 1 |issue=1 |pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barry |first=L.M. |last2=Haraway |first2=D.L. |year=2005 |title=Behavioral Self-Control Strategies for Young Children |url= |journal=JEIBI |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental depression with origins in childhood===
Behavioral theory of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] was outlined by [[Charles Ferster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1973 |title=A functional analysis of depression |journal=American Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=857–870 |pmid=4753644 |doi=10.1037/h0035605}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later revision was provided by Peter Lewisohn and Hyman Hops. Hops continued the work on the role of [[negative reinforcement]] in maintaining depression with Anthony Biglan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |year=1992 |title=Parental depression and child behaviour problems: Implications for behavioural family intervention |journal= Behavior Change |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=126–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |last2=Biglan |first2=A. |last3=Sherman |first3=L.

The most recent summary and conceptual revisions of the behavioral model was provided by Johnathan Kanter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kanter |first=J.W. |last2=Cautilli |first2=J.D. |last3=Busch |first3=A.M. |last4=Baruch |first4=D.E. |year=2005 |title=Toward a Comprehensive Functional Analysis of Depressive Behavior: Five Environmental Factors and a Possible Sixth and Seventh |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard model is that depression has multiple paths to develop. It can be generated by five basic processes, including: lack or loss of [[positive reinforcement]],&lt;ref&gt;In addition to loss of reinforcement, the loss of contingency between behavior and reinforcement can also lead to depression&lt;/ref&gt; direct positive or negative reinforcement for depressive behavior, lack of rule-governed behavior or too much rule-governed behavior, and/or too much environmental [[punishment]]. For children, some of these variables could set the pattern for lifelong problems. For example, a child whose depressive behavior functions for [[negative reinforcement]] by stopping fighting between parents could develop a lifelong pattern of depressive behavior in the case of conflicts. Two paths that are particularly important are (1) lack or loss of reinforcement because of missing necessary skills at a developmental cusp point or (2) the failure to develop adequate rule-governed behavior. For the latter, the child could develop a pattern of always choosing the short-term small immediate reward (i.e., escaping studying for a test) at the expense of the long-term larger reward (passing courses in middle school). The treatment approach that emerged from this research is called [[behavioral activation]].

In addition, use of positive reinforcement has been shown to improve symptoms of depression in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Tabb |first2=L.C. |year=1993 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on childhood depression |journal=Child and Adolesent Social Work Journal |volume=10 |pages=39–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcement has also been shown to improve the self-concept in children with depression comorbid with learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Cassady |first2=J.C. |year=1995 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on self-concepts of children with learning disabilities |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |doi=10.1007/BF01876137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawson and Tabb (1993) used reinforcement with 99 students (90 males and 9 females) aged from 8 to 12 with behavior disorders in a residential treatment program and showed significant reduction in depression symptoms compared to the control group.

===Cognitive behavior===

===Learned units and developmental retardation===
Behavior analysts have spent considerable time measuring learning in both the classroom and at home. In these settings, the role of  a lack of stimulation has often been evidenced in the development of mild and moderate mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. (1966). A functional analysis of retarded development. In N.R. Ellis (Ed.) ''International Review of Research in Mental Retardation''. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has focused on a model of "developmental retardation,".&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, C.R.; Hart, B.; Walker, D. &amp; Risley, T. (1994).

(pp. 161–171) Pacific Grove, CA: Brookes-Cole&lt;/ref&gt; an area that emphasizes cumulative environmental effects and their role in developmental delays. To measure these developmental delays, subjects are given the opportunity to respond, defined as the instructional antecedent, and success is signified by the appropriate response and/or fluency in responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenwood |first=Ward |last2=Luze |year=2003 |title=The Early Communication Indicator (ECI) for Infants and Toddlers: What It Is, Where It's Been, and Where It Needs to Go |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=383–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the learned unit is identified by the opportunity to respond in addition to given reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=D. |last2=Keohane |first2=D. |last3=Healy |year=2002 |title=Quality and Comprehensive Applications of Behavior Analysis to Schooling |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=120–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study employed this model by comparing students' time of instruction was in affluent schools to time of instruction in lower income schools. Results showed that lower income schools displayed approximately 15 minutes less instruction than more affluent schools due to disruptions in [[classroom management]] and [[behavior management]]. Altogether, these disruptions culminated into two years worth of lost instructional time by grade 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Greenwood |first=C.R. |last2=Carta |first2=J.J. |last3=Hart |first3=B. |last4=Kamps |first4=D. |last5=Terry |first5=D. |last6=Delquardi |first6=J.C. |last7=Walker |first7=D. |last8=Risley |first8=T.R. |last9= Risley |first9=T. |last10=Delquadri |first10=Joseph C. |year=1992 |title=Out of the laboratory and into the community: Twenty-six years of applied behavior analysis at Juniper Gardens Children Center |journal=American Psychologist |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1464–1474 |pmid=1482007 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.11.1464|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of behavior analytic research is to provide methods for reducing the overall number of children who fall into the retardation range of development by [[behavioral engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W.

(pp. 223–241). Baltimore: Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart and Risely (1995, 1999) have completed extensive research on this topic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1995). ''Meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young American children''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1999). ''The social world of children learning to talk''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers measured the rates of parent communication with children of the ages of 2–4 years and correlated this information with the IQ scores of the children at age 9. Their analyses revealed that higher parental communication with younger children was positively correlated with higher IQ in older children, even after controlling for race, class, and socio-economic status. Additionally, they concluded a significant change in IQ scores required intervention with at-risk children for approximately 40 hours per week.

===Class formation===
The formation of class-like behavior has also been a significant aspect in the behavioral analysis of development. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zentall |first=T.R. |last2=Galizio |first2=M. |last3=Critchfield |first3=T.S. |year=2002 |title=Categorization, concept learning, and behavior analysis: An introduction |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=237–248 |pmid=12507002 |pmc=1284898 |doi=10.1901/jeab.2002.78-237}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has provided multiple explanations to the development and formation of class-like behavior, including primary [[stimulus generalization]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldiamond, I.

Responses are organized based upon the particular form needed to fit the current environmental challenges as well as the functional consequences. An example of large response classes lies in contingency adduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andronis |first=P.T. |last2=Lang |first2=T.V.J. |last3=Goldiamond |first3=I. |year=1997 |title=Contingency adduction of "symbolic aggression" by pigeon |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=16 |pages=10–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an area that needs much further research, especially with a focus on how large classes of concepts shift. For example, as [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] observed, individuals have a tendency at the pre-operational stage to have limits in their ability to preserve information(Piaget &amp; Szeminska, 1952). While children’s training in the development of conservation skills has been generally successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bucher |first=B. |last2=Schneider |first2=R.E. |year=1973 |title=Acquisition and generalization of conservation by pre-schoolers, using operant training |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187–204 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(73)90160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waghorn |first=L. |last2= Sullivan |first2=E.V. |year=1970 |title=The exploration of transition rules in conservation of quantity (substance) using film mediated modeling |journal=Acta Psychologica |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 65–80 |pmid=5497127 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(70)90091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; complications have been noted.&lt;ref name=Field1987&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Field |first=D. |year=1987 |title=A review of preschool conservation training: An analysis of analyses |journal=Developmental Review |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=210–251 |doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90013-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts argue that this is largely due to the number of tool skills that need to be developed and integrated. Contingency adduction offers a process by which such skills can be synthesized and which shows why it deserves further attention, particularly by early childhood interventionists.

===Autism===
Ferster (1961) was the first researcher to posit a behavior analytic theory for [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1961 |title=Positive reinforcement and the behavioral deficits of autistic children |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |pages=437–456 |pmid=13699189 |doi=10.2307/1126210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferster's model saw autism as a by-product of social interactions between parent and child. Ferster presented an analysis of how a variety of contingencies of reinforcement between parent and child during early childhood might establish and strengthen a repertoire of behaviors typically seen in children diagnosed with autism. A similar model was proposed by Drash and Tutor (1993), who developed the contingency-shaped or behavioral incompatibility theory of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Drash |first=P.W. |last2=Tudor |first2=R.M. |year=1993 |title=A functional analysis of verbal delay in preschool children: Implications for prevention and total recovery |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=11 |pages=19–29|pmid=22477077 |pmc=2748560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified at least six [[reinforcement]] paradigms that may contribute to significant deficiencies in verbal behavior typically characteristic of children diagnosed as austistic. They proposed that each of these paradigms may also create a repertoire of avoidance responses that could contribute to the establishment of a repertoire of behavior that would be incompatible with the acquisition of age-appropriate verbal behavior.
More recent models attribute [[autism]] to neurological and sensory models that are overly worked and subsequently produce the autistic repertoire. Lovaas and Smith (1989) proposed that children with autism have a mismatch between their nervous systems and the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lovaas |first=O.I. |last2=Smith |first2=T. |year=1989 |title=A comprehensive behavior theory of autistic children: Paradigm for research and treatment |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |pmid=2671048 |doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bijou and Ghezzi (1999) proposed a behavioral interference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. &amp; Ghezzi, P.M. (1999). The behavior interference theory of autistic behavior in young children. In P.M. Ghezzi, W.L. Williams &amp; J.E. Carr (Eds.), ''Autism: Behavior analytic perspectives''. (pp. 33–43). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the environmental mismatch model and the inference model were recently reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, M.D.; Wilson, J.L.; Doty, S.J. &amp; Vladescu, J.C. (2008). A Review of the Behavioral Theories of Autism and Evidence for an Environmental Etiology. ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''. Special Compiled Issue 2.4 - 3.1, 46–59.&lt;/ref&gt; and new evidence shows support for the notion that the development of autistic behaviors are due to escape and avoidance of certain types of sensory stimuli. However, most behavioral models of autism remain largely speculative due to limited research efforts.

==Role in education==
One of the largest impacts of behavior analysis of child development is its role in the field of education. In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used [[operant conditioning]] techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the [[direct instruction]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. &amp; Carnine, D. (1991). ''Theory of instruction: Principles and applications''. Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Englemann |first=S.E. |year=1968 |title=Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching |journal=Journal of School Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |doi=10.1016/0022-4405(68)90002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Fred S. Keller]] used similar techniques to develop [[programmed instruction]]. [[B.F. Skinner]] developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, [[Ogden Lindsley]], developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the "Standard Behavior Chart," now "Standard Celeration Chart," used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed "celeration"). The use of this charting tool for analysis of instructional effects or other environmental variables through the direct measurement of learner performance has become known as [[precision teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Calkin, A.B. |year=2005 |title=Precision teaching: the standard celeration charts |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |url= |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior analysts with a focus on behavioral development form the basis of a movement called [[positive behavior support]] (PBS). PBS has focused on building safe schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=T.M. Gagnon |last2=Nelson |first2=C.M. |year=2008 |title=School-Wide Systems of Positive Behavior Support: A Framework for Reducing School Crime and Violence |journal=Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=69–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, there are many different kinds of learning that are implemented to improve skills needed for interactions later in life. Examples of this differential learning include social and language skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Child Development" Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. 2001. 5 February 2008. http://www.nwrel.org/request/june01/child.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NWREL (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory), too much interaction with technology will hinder a child's social interactions with others due to its potential to become an addiction and subsequently lead to anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Meltz, Barbara F. "Zora and the explorer" ''The Boston Globe'' October 22, 2007 Globe Newspaper Company 5 February 2008 http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/10/22/zora_and_the_explorer&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of language development, children will start to learn and know about 5–20 different words by 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt;"Language Development In Children" Child Development Institute, LLC 1998–2007. 5 February 2008. http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/language_development.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of behavioral approach and new developments==
Behavior analytic theories have been criticized for their focus on the explanation of the acquisition of relatively simple behavior (i.e., the behavior of nonhuman species, of infants, and of individuals who are intellectually disabled or autistic) rather than of complex behavior (see Commons &amp; Miller).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=2001 |title=A Quantitative Behavioral Model of Developmental Stage Based upon the Model of Hierarchical Complexity |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=222–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Commons]] continued [[behavior analysis]]'s rejection of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]] and the substitution of a [[task analysis]] of the particular skills to be learned. In his new model, Commons has created a behavior analytic model of more complex behavior in line with more contemporary quantitative behavior analytic models called the [[model of hierarchical complexity]]. Commons constructed the model of hierarchical complexity of tasks and their corresponding stages of performance using just three main axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=1998 |title=A quantitative behavior-analytic theory of development |journal=Mexican Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=153–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Trudeau |first2=E.J. |last3=Stein |first3=S.A. |last4=Richards |first4= F.A. |last5=Krause |first5=S.R. |year=1998 |title=Hierarchical Complexity of Tasks Shows the Existence of Developmental Stages |journal=Developmental Review |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=237–278 |doi=10.1006/drev.1998.0467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of development, recent work has been generated regarding the combination of behavior analytic views with dynamical systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, G. &amp; Pelaez, M. (2004). ''Child and adolescent development: A behavioral systems approach''. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The added benefit of this approach is its portrayal of how small patterns of changes in behavior in terms of principles and mechanisms over time can produce substantial changes in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Novak |first=G. |last2=Pelaez |first2=M. |year=2002 |title=A behavior-analytic developmental model is better |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=25 |pages=466–468 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x02340081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research in behavior analysis attempts to extend the patterns learned in childhood and to determine their impact on [[adult development]].

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for the behavior analysis of child development.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25: [[behavior analysis]].

The World Association for Behavior Analysis has a certification in behavior therapy. The exam draws questions on behavioral theories of child development as well as behavioral theories of child psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Bestiarii (EUR Museum).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Relief of bestiarii and animals in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]].]] --&gt;
Among [[Ancient Romans]], '''''bestiarii''''' (singular '''''bestiarius''''') were those who went into combat with beasts, or were exposed to them. It is conventional&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0247&amp;q1=bestiarii Entry on Bestiarii] at Chambers, Ephraim, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'', c. 1680-1740&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish two categories of ''bestiarii'': the first were those condemned to death via the beasts (see ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]'') and the second were those who faced them voluntarily, for pay or glory (see ''[[venatio]]'').&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;William Smith, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Bestiarii.html "Bestiarii"] from ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray: London, 1875. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are sometimes erroneously called ''[[gladiator]]s''; to their contemporaries, however, the term ''gladiator'' referred specifically to one who fought other men. The contemporary term for those who made a career out of participating in arena "hunts" was '''[[List of Roman gladiator types#Venator|venatores]]'''.

== As a form of execution ==
As a means of [[torture|torturous]] [[capital punishment]], death by wild beasts was a punishment for [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/bestiarii.html The Bestiarius and the Ludus Matutinus]&lt;/ref&gt; a category which included those taken prisoner and slaves found guilty of a serious crime. These were sent to their deaths naked and unable to defend themselves against the beasts. Even if they succeeded in killing one, fresh animals were continually let loose on them, until the ''bestiarii'' were all dead. It is reported that it was seldom necessary for two beasts to be required to take down one man. On the contrary, one beast frequently dispatched several men. [[Cicero]] mentions a single lion which alone dispatched 200 ''bestiarii''.&lt;!--all at once, or over time?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

== Voluntary combat ==
''Bestiarii'', as reported by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt; consisted of young men who, to become expert in managing their arms, fought sometimes against beasts, and sometimes against one another; and of bravos who, to show their courage and dexterity, exposed themselves to this dangerous combat. [[Augustus]] encouraged this practice in young men of the first rank; [[Nero]] exposed himself to it; and it was for killing beasts in the [[amphitheatre]] that [[Commodus]] acquired the title of the Roman [[Hercules]].&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

[[Blaise de Vigenère|Vigenère]] adds two more types of ''bestiarii'':&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopaedia'', apparently referring to some one of Vigenère's French translations of Latin works, such as his translation of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Commentaries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the first were those who made a trade of it, and fought for money. It appears that there were schools in Rome, in which people were trained to fight wild beasts (''scholae bestiarum'', or ''bestiariorum'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus]]'', [http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticum_becker.htm#C35 chapter 35]; cited in Smith 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; The second type was where several armed ''bestiarii'' were let loose at once against a number of beasts.&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], a '''canonical transformation''' is a change of [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''t'') → ('''Q''', '''P''', ''t'')}} that preserves the form of [[Hamilton's equations]]. This is sometimes known as '''form invariance'''. It need not preserve the form of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] itself. Canonical transformations are useful in their own right, and also form the basis for the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s (a useful method for calculating [[constant of motion|conserved quantities]]) and [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] (itself the basis for classical [[statistical mechanics]]).

Since [[Lagrangian mechanics]] is based on [[generalized coordinates]], transformations of the coordinates {{math|'''q''' → '''Q'''}} do not affect the form of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] and, hence, do not affect the form of [[Hamilton's equations]] if we simultaneously change the momentum by a [[Legendre transformation]] into

:&lt;math&gt;P_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{Q}_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, coordinate transformations (also called '''point transformations''') are a ''type'' of canonical transformation. However, the class of canonical transformations is much broader, since the old generalized coordinates, momenta and even time may be combined to form the new generalized coordinates and momenta.  Canonical transformations that do not include the time explicitly are called '''restricted canonical transformations''' (many textbooks consider only this type).

For clarity, we restrict the presentation here to [[calculus]] and [[classical mechanics]].  Readers familiar with more advanced mathematics such as [[cotangent bundle]]s, [[exterior derivative]]s and [[symplectic manifold]]s should read the related [[symplectomorphism]] article.  (Canonical transformations are a special case of a symplectomorphism.)  However, a brief introduction to the modern mathematical description is included at the end of this article.

==Notation==
Boldface variables such as {{math|'''q'''}} represent a list of {{mvar|N}} [[generalized coordinates]] that need not transform like a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] under [[rotation]], e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \equiv \left (q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{N-1}, q_{N} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

A dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} \equiv \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dot product]] notation between two lists of the same number of coordinates is a shorthand for the sum of the products of corresponding components, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} \equiv \sum_{k=1}^{N} p_{k} q_{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product (also known as an "inner product") maps the two coordinate lists into one variable representing a single numerical value.

==Direct approach==
The functional form of [[Hamilton's equations]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\dot{\mathbf{q}} &amp;= \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, the transformed coordinates have analogous dynamics

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{P}} &amp;= -\frac{\partial K}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
\dot{\mathbf{Q}} &amp;= \frac{\partial K}{\partial \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''K''('''Q''', '''P''')}} is a new Hamiltonian (sometimes called the Kamiltonian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that must be determined.

In general, a  transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''t'') → ('''Q''', '''P''', ''t'')}} does not preserve the form of [[Hamilton's equations]].  For time independent transformations between {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} and {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}} we may check if the transformation is restricted canonical, as follows.  Since restricted transformations have no explicit time dependence (by definition), the time derivative of a new generalized coordinate {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{Q}_{m} &amp;= \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} - \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
&amp;= \lbrace Q_m , H \rbrace
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{⋅, ⋅} }} is the [[Poisson bracket]].

We also have the identity for the conjugate momentum ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H}{\partial P_{m}} =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{q}}{\partial P_{m}} +  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial P_{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the transformation is canonical, these two must be equal, resulting in the equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left( \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial p_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\left( \frac{\partial q_{n}}{\partial P_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}} \\
\left( \frac{\partial Q_{m}}{\partial q_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial p_{n}}{\partial P_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The analogous argument for the generalized momenta ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' leads to two other sets of equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left( \frac{\partial P_{m}}{\partial p_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= \left( \frac{\partial q_{n}}{\partial Q_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}} \\
\left( \frac{\partial P_{m}}{\partial q_{n}}\right)_{\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}} &amp;= -\left( \frac{\partial p_{n}}{\partial Q_{m}}\right)_{\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the '''direct conditions''' to check whether a given transformation is canonical.

==Liouville's theorem==
The direct conditions allow us to prove [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], which states that the ''volume'' in  phase space is conserved under canonical transformations, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \int d\mathbf{q} d\mathbf{p} = \int d\mathbf{Q} d\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables|calculus]], the latter integral must equal the former times the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] {{mvar|J}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int d\mathbf{Q} d\mathbf{P} = \int J d\mathbf{q} d\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where the Jacobian is the [[determinant]] of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s, which we write as

:&lt;math&gt;J \equiv \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})}&lt;/math&gt;

Exploiting the "division" property of [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]s yields

:&lt;math&gt; J \equiv \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P})} \left/ \frac{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})}{\partial (\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P})} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating the repeated variables gives

:&lt;math&gt;J \equiv  \frac{\partial (\mathbf{Q})}{\partial (\mathbf{q})} \left/ \frac{\partial (\mathbf{p})}{\partial (\mathbf{P})} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Application of the '''direct conditions''' above yields {{math|''J'' {{=}} 1}}.

==Generating function approach==
{{main|Generating function (physics)}}
To ''guarantee'' a valid transformation between {{math|('''q''', '''p''', ''H'')}} and {{math|('''Q''', '''P''', ''K'')}}, we may resort to an indirect '''generating function''' approach. Both sets of variables must obey [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]]. That is the [[Action Integral]] over the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{qp}=\mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{QP}=\mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt; respectively, obtained by the Hamiltonian via ("inverse") [[Legendre transformation]], both must be stationary (so that one can use the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] to arrive at equations of the above-mentioned and designated form; as it is shown for example [[Hamilton equations#Deriving Hamilton's equations|here]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) \right] dt &amp;= 0 \\
\delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) \right] dt &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One way for both [[calculus of variations|variational integral]] equalities to be satisfied is to have

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) \right] = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{dG}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

Lagrangians are not unique: one can always multiply by a constant {{mvar|λ}} and add a total time derivative {{math|{{sfrac|''dG''|''dt''}}}} and yield the same equations of motion (see for reference: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Classical_Mechanics/Lagrange_Theory#Is_the_Lagrangian_unique.3F]).

In general, the scaling factor {{mvar|λ}} is set equal to one; canonical transformations for which {{math|''λ'' ≠ 1}} are called '''extended canonical transformations'''. {{math|{{sfrac|''dG''|''dt''}}}} is kept, otherwise the problem would be rendered trivial and there would be not much freedom for the new canonical variables to differ from the old ones.

Here {{mvar|G}} is a [[generating function (physics)|generating function]] of one old [[canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate]] ({{math|'''q'''}} or {{math|'''p'''}}), one new [[canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate]] ({{math|'''Q'''}} or {{math|'''P'''}}) and (possibly) the time {{mvar|t}}.  Thus, there are four basic types of generating functions (although it should be noted that mixtures of these four types can exist), depending on the choice of variables. As will be shown below, the generating function will define a transformation from old to new [[canonical coordinates]], and any such transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} is guaranteed to be canonical.

===Type 1 generating function===
The type 1 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old and new generalized coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;G \equiv G_{1}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{Q}, t)&lt;/math&gt;
To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows.   The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} =\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|'''Q'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''Q'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;K = H + \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.  For example, let 
:&lt;math&gt;
G_{1} \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{Q}
&lt;/math&gt;
This results in swapping the generalized coordinates for the momenta and vice versa 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{1}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} = -\mathbf{q}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''K'' {{=}} ''H''}}.  This example illustrates how independent the coordinates and momenta are in the Hamiltonian formulation; they are equivalent variables.

===Type 2 generating function===
The type 2 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old [[generalized coordinates]] and the new generalized momenta
:&lt;math&gt;G \equiv -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P} + G_{2}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change the right-hand side of the equation below.  To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) =   -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the old coordinates and new momenta are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \\
\mathbf{Q} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows.   The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''P'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates {{math|'''Q'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}. We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;K = H + \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.  For example, let 
:&lt;math&gt;G_{2} \equiv \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{q}; t) \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''g'''}} is a set of {{mvar|N}} functions.  This results in a point transformation of the generalized coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{q}; t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Type 3 generating function===
The type 3 generating function {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} depends only on the old generalized momenta and the new generalized coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;
G \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} + G_{3}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{Q}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change the left-hand side of the equation below.  To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{q} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \\
\mathbf{P} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows. The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} = -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|'''Q'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''Q'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = -\frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial \mathbf{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}. Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
K = H + \frac{\partial G_{3}}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.

===Type 4 generating function===
The type 4 generating function &lt;math&gt;G_{4}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{P}, t)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the old and new generalized momenta
:&lt;math&gt;
G \equiv \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P} + G_{4}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{P}, t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; terms represent a [[Legendre transformation]] to change both sides of the equation below.    To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above

:&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}}  - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = -\mathbf{Q} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{p}} + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following {{math|2''N'' + 1}} equations must hold

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{q} &amp;= -\frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \\
\mathbf{Q} &amp;= \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} \\
K &amp;= H + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations define the transformation {{math|('''q''', '''p''') → ('''Q''', '''P''')}} as follows. The ''first'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{q} = -\frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
&lt;/math&gt;

define relations between the new generalized momenta {{math|'''P'''}} and the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as a function of the old canonical coordinates.  Substitution of these formulae for the {{math|'''P'''}} coordinates into the ''second'' set of {{mvar|N}} equations

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} &lt;/math&gt;

yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates {{math|'''Q'''}} in terms of the old [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}}.  We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the ''old'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''q''', '''p''')}} as functions of the ''new'' [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.  Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
K = H + \frac{\partial G_{4}}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;
yields a formula for {{mvar|K}} as a function of the new [[canonical coordinates]] {{math|('''Q''', '''P''')}}.

==Motion as a canonical transformation==
Motion itself (or, equivalently, a shift in the time origin) is a canonical transformation. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(t) \equiv \mathbf{q}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t) \equiv \mathbf{p}(t+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, then [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]] is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \left[ \mathbf{P} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{Q}} - K(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{P}, t) \right] dt = \delta \int_{t_{1}+\tau}^{t_{2}+\tau}  \left[ \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t+\tau) \right] dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

since a valid trajectory &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{q}(t), \mathbf{p}(t))&lt;/math&gt; should always satisfy [[action (physics)|Hamilton's principle]], regardless of the endpoints.

==Modern mathematical description==
In mathematical terms, [[canonical coordinates]] are any coordinates on the phase space ([[cotangent bundle]]) of the system that allow the [[canonical one-form]] to be written  as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i\,dq^i&lt;/math&gt;

up to a total differential ([[exact form]]). The change of variable between one set of canonical coordinates and another is a '''canonical transformation'''.   The index of the [[generalized coordinate]]s {{math|'''q'''}} is written here as a ''superscript'' (&lt;math&gt;q^{i}&lt;/math&gt;), not as a ''subscript'' as done above (&lt;math&gt;q_{i}&lt;/math&gt;).  The superscript conveys the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant transformation properties]] of the generalized coordinates, and does ''not'' mean that the coordinate is being raised to a power.  Further details may be found at the [[symplectomorphism]] article.

==History==
The first major application of the canonical transformation was in 1846, by [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay|Charles Delaunay]], in the study of the [[Earth-Moon-Sun system]]. This work resulted in the publication of a pair of large volumes as ''Mémoires'' by the [[French Academy of Sciences]], in 1860 and 1867.

'''Combinatory categorial grammar''' ('''CCG''') is an efficiently [[parsable]], yet linguistically expressive grammar formalism. It has a transparent interface between surface syntax and underlying semantic representation, including predicate-argument structure, quantification and information structure. The formalism generates constituency-based structures (as opposed to dependency-based ones) and is therefore a type of [[phrase structure grammar]] (as opposed to a [[dependency grammar]]).

CCG relies on [[combinatory logic]], which has the same expressive power as the [[lambda calculus]], but builds its expressions differently. The first linguistic and psycholinguistic arguments for basing the grammar on combinators were put forth by [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]. More recent prominent proponents of the approach are [http://cog.brown.edu/People/jacobson/ Jacobson] and [http://www.jasonbaldridge.com/ Baldridge].

For example, the [[combinator]] B (the compositor) is useful in creating long-distance dependencies, as in "Who do you think Mary is talking about?" and the combinator W (the duplicator) is useful as the lexical interpretation of reflexive pronouns, as in "Mary talks about herself". Together with I (the identity mapping) and C (the permutator) these form a set of primitive, non-interdefinable combinators. Jacobson interprets personal pronouns as the combinator I, and their binding is aided by a complex combinator Z, as in "Mary lost her way". Z is definable using W and B.

==Parts of the formalism==

The CCG formalism defines a number of combinators (application, composition, and type-raising being the most common). These operate on syntactically-typed lexical items, by means of [[Natural deduction]] style proofs. The goal of the proof is to find some way of applying the combinators to a sequence of lexical items until no lexical item is unused in the proof. The resulting type after the proof is complete is the type of the whole expression. Thus, proving that some sequence of words is a sentence of some language amounts to proving that the words reduce to the type ''S''.

===Syntactic types===

The syntactic type of a lexical item can be either a primitive type, such as ''S'', ''N'', or ''NP'', or complex, such as ''S\NP'', or ''NP/N''.

The complex types, schematizable as ''X/Y'' and ''X\Y'', denote functor types that take an argument of type ''Y'' and return an object of type ''X''. A forward slash denotes that the argument should appear to the right, while a backslash denotes that the argument should appear on the left. Any type can stand in for the ''X'' and ''Y'' here, making syntactic types in CCG a recursive type system.

===Application combinators===

The application combinators, often denoted by ''&gt;'' for forward application and ''&lt;'' for backward application, apply a lexical item with a functor type to an argument with an appropriate type. The definition of application is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y}{\alpha \beta : X}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X}&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Composition combinators===

The composition combinators, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward composition and &lt;math&gt;B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward composition, are similar to function composition from mathematics, and can be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y/Z}{\alpha \beta : X/Z}B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y\backslash Z \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X\backslash Z}B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Type-raising combinators===

The type-raising combinators, often denoted as &lt;math&gt;T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward type-raising and &lt;math&gt;T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward type-raising, take argument types (usually primitive types) to functor types, which take as their argument the functors that, before type-raising, would have taken them as arguments.

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T/(T\backslash X)}T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T\backslash (T/X)}T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

The sentence "the dog bit John" has a number of different possible proofs. Below are a few of them. The variety of proofs demonstrates the fact that in CCG, sentences don't have a single structure, as in other models of grammar.

Let the types of these lexical items be

&lt;math&gt;the : NP/N \qquad dog : N \qquad John : NP \qquad bit : (S\backslash NP)/NP&lt;/math&gt;

We can perform the simplest proof (changing notation slightly for brevity) as:

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
       \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
       \qquad
       \dfrac{dog}{N}
    }{NP}&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
        \qquad
        \dfrac{John}{NP}
    }{S\backslash NP}&gt;
}{S}&lt;
&lt;/math&gt;

Opting to type-raise and compose some, we could get a fully incremental, left-to-right proof.  The ability to construct such a proof is an argument for the psycholinguistic plausibility of CCG, because listeners do in fact construct partial interpretations (syntactic and semantic) of utterances before they have been completed.

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{
            \dfrac{
                \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
                \dfrac{dog}{N}
                \qquad
            }{NP}&gt;
        }{S/(S\backslash NP)}T_&gt;
        \qquad
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
    }{S/NP}B_&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{John}{NP}
}{S}&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

CCGs are known to be able to generate the language &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n : n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a non-context-free [[indexed language]]). A grammar for this language  can be found in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994).&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995" /&gt;

Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994)&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995"&gt;Vijay-Shanker, K. and Weir, David J. 1994. ''The Equivalence of Four Extensions of Context-Free Grammars''. Mathematical Systems Theory 27(6): 511–546.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that [[Indexed grammar#Linear indexed grammars|Linear Indexed Grammars]], Combinatory Categorial Grammars, [[Tree-adjoining grammar|Tree-adjoining Grammars]], and [[Head grammar|Head Grammars]] are [[Weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] formalisms, in that they all define the same string languages.

Computational Linguistics 41(2): 215-247.&lt;/ref&gt; show that this equivalence, and the ability of CCG to describe &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n}&lt;/math&gt;, rely crucially on the ability to restrict the use of the combinatory rules to certain categories, in ways not explained above.

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==

The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S. J. |last2=Sack |first2=L. |last3=Franklin |first3=C. E. |last4=Farrell |first4=A. P. |last5=Beardall |first5=J. |last6=Wikelski |first6=M. |last7=Chown |first7=S.

== Description ==

The rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a "Discipline with a deadline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, Edward Osborne |title=The future of life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-316-64853-1 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology is tied closely to [[ecology]] in researching the [[population ecology]] ([[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], [[wikt:migration|migration]], [[demographics]], [[effective population size]], [[inbreeding depression]], and [[minimum viable population|minimum population viability]]) of [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Indigenous Uses, Population Density, and Conservation of Threatened Medicinal Plants in Protected Areas of the Indian Himalayas |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=368–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00602.x |jstor=3591249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;

=== Natural resource conservation ===

Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=www.ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175825/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]]. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004).

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings.

=== Early naturalists ===

[[File:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[gyrfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]] ]]

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E. O. Wilson |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E. L. | year = 1972 | title = James Burnett, Lord Monboddo | publication-place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 196 | isbn = 0-19-812437-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of thinkers, among them notably [[Lord Monboddo]],&lt;ref name="Cloyd" /&gt; described the importance of "preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in [[Christian theology]].

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author1=G.

In the [[United States]], the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] gave the President power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, and the [[New York Zoological Society]] was set up in 1895. A series of [[National Park|national forests and preserves]] were established by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from 1901 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation - Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223142405/http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-23 |title=Environmental timeline 1890–1920 |website=runet.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Davis96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7185-1548-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir|Muir]] on [[Glacier Point]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]]]

In the 20th century, [[Canadians|Canadian]] civil servants, including [[Charles Gordon Hewitt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/HEWI1885.htm |title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: Charles Gordon Hewitt |website=people.wku.edu |accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Harkin]] spearheaded the movement toward [[wildlife conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;For a review and introduction to the history of wildlife conservation and preservation in Canada, see {{cite book |author=Foster, Janet |title=Working for wildlife: the beginning of preservation in Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1997 |isbn=0-8020-7969-5 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8KLFOFGXvYQC&amp;dq=Janet+Foster+working+for+wildlife&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring extinction rates ===
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E. O. Wilson|title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013400/http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.'&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | isbn= | pmid=20056880 | ref=harv|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Will R. |last2=Brandon |first2=Katrina |last3=Brooks |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Costanza |first4=Robert |last5=da Fonesca |first5=Gustavo A. B. |last6=Portela |first6=Rosimeiry |title=Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=10 |year=2007 |pages=868–73 |doi=10.1641/B571009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A.

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where [[biomass]], not biodiversity, reigns supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Underwood EC, Shaw MR, Wilson KA |title=Protecting Biodiversity when Money Matters: Maximizing Return on Investment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e1515 |year=2008 |pmid=18231601 |pmc=2212107 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001515 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001515|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1515U |editor1-last=Somers |editor1-first=Michael |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the [[endemic species]] to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroux SJ, Schmiegelow FK |title=Biodiversity concordance and the importance of endemism |journal=Conserv.

Summary of 2006 [[IUCN Red List]] categories

Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|title= The Biodiversity Hotspots|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222043456/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate= 2008-12-22|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass.&lt;ref name="Wood08" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2012}} Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary [[adaptation|adaptability]], and biomass.&lt;ref&gt;The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowen |first=B.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main article|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main article|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Miner's canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C. Dennis |author2=Meffe, Gary K. |title=Principles of conservation biology |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1997 |isbn=0-87893-521-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|88–89}}).

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main article|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;Fedriani JM, García L, Sanchéz M, Calderon J, and C Ramo. 2017. Long-term impact of protected colonial birds on a jeopardized cork oak population: conservation bias leads to restoration failure. Journal of Applied Ecology 54: 450-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and trends ==

Conservation biologists study trends and process from the [[paleontological]] past to the [[ecological]] present as they gain an understanding of the context related to [[species extinction]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt; It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include: the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|Ordovician]] (440 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian]] (370 mya), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] (245 mya), [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] (200 mya), and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (66 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost;&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ehrlich, Anne H. |author2=Ehrlich, Paul R. |title=Extinction: the causes and consequences of the disappearance of species |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=0-394-51312-6 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say the rates of [[deforestation]], [[Coral reef destruction|reef destruction]], [[Threats to wetlands|wetland draining]] and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species.

=== Status of oceans and reefs ===
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}}

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policy document 12/05. {{ISBN|0-85403-617-2}} [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13539 Download]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

=== Groups other than vertebrates ===

Serious concerns also being raised about [[Taxonomic rank|taxonomic groups]] that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates.

The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d. Web. 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists.

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main article|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

=== Threats to biodiversity ===
{{Main article|Biodiversity threats}}

Today, many threats to Biodiversity exist. An acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day H.I.P.P.O stands for Habitat Loss, Invasive Species, Pollution, Human Population, and Overharvesting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog030/node/394|title=Threats to Biodiversity {{!}} GEOG 030: Geographic Perspectives on Sustainability and  Human-Environment Systems, 2011|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threats to biodiversity are [[habitat destruction]] (such as [[deforestation]], [[agricultural expansion]], [[Urban planning|urban development]]), and [[overexploitation]] (such as [[wildlife trade]]).&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freckleton |first1=Rob |last2=Sodhi |first2=Navjot S. |last3=Bickford |first3=David |last4=Diesmos |first4=Arvin C. |last5=Lee |first5=Tien Ming |last6=Koh |first6=Lian Pin |last7=Brook |first7=Barry W. |last8=Sekercioglu |first8=Cagan H. |last9=Bradshaw |first9=Corey J.

However, human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere. With [[Conservation management system|conservation management and planning]] for biodiversity at all levels, from [[gene]]s to ecosystems, there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Gerald |year=2005 |title=Ecology &amp; Anthropology: A Field Without Future? |journal=Ecological and Environmental Anthropology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–5 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdmeea/33/ |oclc=729066337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the current threats to biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start anew.

Many of the threats to biodiversity, including disease and climate change, are reaching inside borders of protected areas, leaving them 'not-so protected' (e.g. [[Yellowstone National Park]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMenamin |first1=S.

[[File:Inner Sanctum of Sri Chalukya Kumara Rama Bheemeshwara Swamy Temple in SAMALKOT.jpg|thumb|360px|A ''darśana'' literally a means glimpse or view. In a [[Hindu temple]], the term refers to viewing the inner sanctum under the main [[Shikhara]] or [[Gopuram]] of the temple, which hosts the [[murti]] (image of a god). The above arrangement is for darśana at the [[Chalukya Kumararama Bhimeswara Temple]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

'''Darśana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दर्शन, lit. ''view, sight'') is the auspicious sight of a deity or a holy person.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} The term also refers to six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] and their literature on spirituality and [[soteriology]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word, also in the forms of ''darśana'' or ''darshanam'', comes from [[Sanskrit]] दर्शन, from ''dṛś'', "to see", [[vision (spirituality)|vision]], apparition or glimpse.

==Definition==
''Darśana'' is described as an "auspicious sight" of a holy person, which bestows merit on the person who is seen.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} "Sight" here means seeing or beholding, and/or being seen or beheld.

It is most commonly used for [[theophany]], "manifestation / visions of the divine", in [[Hindu worship]], e.g. of a deity (especially in image form), or a very holy person or artifact. One can receive ''darśana'' or a glimpse of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great [[guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Darshan |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151828/darshan |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=12 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
The term ''darśana'' also refers to the six systems of thought, called ''darśanam'', that comprise classical [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett284&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, pages 88, 284&lt;/ref&gt; The term therein implies how each of these six systems distinctively look at things and the scriptures in Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=royperrett284/&gt;&lt;ref name=britdarshan/&gt; The six orthodox Hindu ''darśana'' are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta]]. Buddhism and Jainism are examples of non-Hindu ''darśana''s.&lt;ref name=britdarshan&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/darshan Darshan - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Mahayana Buddhism ==
&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Mahāyāna Buddhism" links here. Please adjust accordingly if renaming or removing section.--&gt;
On the significance of ''darśana'' in [[Mahayana]] thought, Paul Harrison writes: "By the second century CE... the vision of the [[Buddha]] (''buddha-darśana'') and the accompanying hearing of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-śravaṇa'') are represented as a transformation experience of decisive importance for practitioners, be they who have renounced (mundane life) "ascetics" or householders."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harrison, "Commemoration and identification in Buddhanusmṛti", in {{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharma]], collections of systematic summaries of the [[sutra]]s, mention ''Darśana-[[citta]], i.e.'' [[vision (spirituality)|visions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyatso|1992|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Mahayana philosophers [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] acknowledged [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#Five Paths|five paths to liberation]], of which the third is ''darśana-marga'', the "path of seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gethin|1998|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarjuna]], a prominent philosopher of the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Mahayana Buddhism, wrote that the wise person perceives ''[[tattva]]-darśana,'' true reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] |trans-title=Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way |chapter=Chapter 26 |at=verse 10 |nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unno|1993|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}

==Other meanings==
''Darśana'' also sometimes has a more mundane meaning. For example, [[Sivananda Saraswati]] wrote in his book ''The Practice of Brahmacharya'' that one of the eight aspects of [[brahmacharya]] ([[Celibacy#Hinduism|celibacy]]) is not to look lustfully at women: "You should carefully avoid... Darshana or looking at women with passionate resolve".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sivananda|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar of religion Richard H. Davis has said that ''darśana'' (viewpoint, philosophical school) is one of three terms in classical Indian discourse that could be considered roughly analogous to what today's English-speakers understand as "religion." The other two terms are ''[[dharma]]'' (duty, morality, a code of proper conduct) and ''[[Buddhist Paths to liberation|marga]]'' (route, spiritual path). According to Davis, "most Hindu texts accepted that religious paths (''marga'') are relative to the points of view (''darśana'') and moral responsibilities (''dharma'') of practitioners, whose individual circumstances may make one or another course of action more appropriate in their particular situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2008|pp=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet [[Gary Snyder]] has given a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] meaning to ''darśana'': 
{{quote|It's a gift; it's like there's a moment in which the thing is ready to let you see it. In India, this is called ''darshan''. Darshan means getting a view, and if the clouds blow away, as they did once for me, and you get a view of the [[Himalayas]] from the foothills, an Indian person would say, 'Ah, the Himalayas are giving you their darshana'; they're letting you have their view. This comfortable, really deep way of getting a sense of something takes time. It doesn't show itself to you right away. It isn't even necessary to know the names of things the way a botanist would. It's more important to be aware of the '[[suchness]]' of the thing; it's a reality. It's also a source of a certain kind of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for [[creativity]]. I see it in the work of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1994|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Sikh culture, folios or manuscripts that depict all ten Gurus on a single page are called ''darśana'' paintings, simply because they offer a vision of all ten sacred Gurus in one glance.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Data Re-Identification''' is the practice of matching [[data anonymization|anonymous data]] (also known as de-identified data) with publicly available information, or auxiliary data, in order to discover the individual to which the data belongs to. This is a concern because companies with [[privacy (internet)|privacy]] [[Policy|policies]], [[health care]] providers, and [[financial institution]]s may release the data they collect after the data has gone through the de-identification process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Porter, Christine. 2008 "CONSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY: De-Identified Data and Third Party Data Mining: The Risk of Re-Identification of Personal Information." University of Washington Shidler Journal of Law, Commerce &amp; Technology.  Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The de-identification process involves masking, generalizing or deleting both direct and indirect identifiers; the definition of this process is not universal, however.&lt;ref name="Lagos, Yianni 2014"&gt;Lagos, Yianni. 2014. "SYMPOSIUM: TAKING THE PERSONAL OUT OF DATA: MAKING SENSE OF DE-IDENTIFICATION." Indiana Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Information in the [[public domain]], even seemingly anonymized, may thus be re-identified in combination with other pieces of available data and basic [[computer science]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;McGeveran, William. 2011. "PRIVACY, DEMOCRACY, AND ELECTIONS: MRS. MCINTYRE'S PERSONA: BRINGING PRIVACY THEORY TO ELECTION LAW." William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Rule Agencies, a collection of multiple U.S. federal agencies and departments including the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], speculate that re-identification is becoming gradually easier because of "big data" - the abundance and constant collection and analysis of information along the evolution of technologies and the advances of algorithms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Groden, Samantha, Summer Martin, and Rebecca Merrill. 2016. "Proposed Changes to the Common Rule: A Standoff Between Patient Rights and Scientific Advances?" Journal of Health &amp; Life Sciences Law. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have claimed that de-identification is a safe and effective data liberation tool and do not view re-identification as a concern.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Richardson, Victor, Sallie Milam, and Denise Chrylser. 2015. "Is Sharing De-identined Data Legal? The State of Public Health Confidentiality Laws and Their Interplay with Statistical Disclosure Limitation Techniques." Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 study found that 87 percent of the U.S. population can be identified using a combination of their gender, birthdate and zip code.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Others do not think that re-identification is a serious threat, and call it a "myth"; they claim that the combination of zip code, date of birth and gender is rare or partially complete, such as only the year and month birth without the date, or the county name instead of the specific zip code, thus the risk of such re-identification is reduced in many instances.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

== Legal protections of data in the United States ==

Existing privacy regulations typically protect information that has been modified, so that the data is deemed anonymized, or de-identified. For financial information, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] permits its circulation if it is  de-identified and aggregated.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm Leach Bliley Act]] (GLBA), which mandates financial institutions give consumers the opportunity to [[Opt-out|opt out]] of having their information shared with third parties, does not cover de-identified data if the information is aggregate and does not contain personal identifiers, since this data is not treated as [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Educational records ===
{{See also|Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act}}
In terms of university records, authorities both on the state and federal level have shown an awareness about issues of [[privacy in education]] and a distaste for institutions' disclosure of information. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] has provided guidance about data discourse and identification, instructing educational institutions to be sensitive to the risk of re-identification of anonymous data by cross-referencing with auxiliary data, to minimize the amount of data in the public domain by decreasing publication of directory information about students and institutional personnel, and to be consistent in the processes of de-identification.&lt;ref&gt;Peltz, Richard. 2009. "Beyond the Final Frontier: A "Post-Racial" America?: The Responsibilities of Citizens: From the Ivory Tower to the Glass House: Access to "De-Identified" Public University Admission Records to Study Affirmative Action." Harvard Journal on Racial and Ethic Justice. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical records ===
{{See also|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act}}

Medical information of patients are becoming increasingly available on the Internet, on free and publicly accessing platforms such as HealthData.gov and PatientsLikeMe, encouraged by government open data policies and data-sharing initiatives spearheaded by the private sector.  While this level of accessibility yields many benefits, concerns regarding discrimination and privacy have been raised.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Sharona. 2015. "Citizen Science: The Law and Ethics of Public Access to Medical Big Data." Berkeley Technology Law Journal. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Protections on [[medical records]] and consumer data from [[pharmacies]] are stronger compared to those for other kinds of consumer data. The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) protects the privacy of identifiable data about health, but authorize information release to third parties if de-identified. In addition, it mandates that patients receive breach notifications should there be more than a low probability that the patient's information was inappropriately disclosed or utilized without sufficient mitigation of the harm to him or her.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Yelena. 2016. "RECENT CASE DEVELOPMENTS: Increasing Recognition of "Risk of Harm" as an Injury Sufficient to Warrant Standing in Class Action Medical Data Breach Cases." American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of re-identification is a factor in determining the probability that the patient's information has been compromised. Commonly, pharmacies sell de-identified information to [[data mining]] companies that sell to pharmaceutical companies in turn.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;


There have been state laws enacted to ban data mining of medical information, but they were struck down by federal courts in Maine and New Hampshire on First Amendment grounds. Another federal court on another case used "illusive" to describe concerns about privacy of patients and did not recognize the risks of re-identification.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Biospecimen ===
The Notice of Proposed Rule Making, published by the Common Rule Agencies in September 2015, expanded the umbrella term of "human subject" in research to include biospecimens, or materials taken from the human body - blood, urine, tissue etc. This mandates that researchers using biospecimens must follow the stricter requirements of doing researcher with human subjects. The rationale for this is the increased risk of re-identification of biospecimen.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The final revisions affirmed this regulation.&lt;ref&gt;24 C.F.R. § .104 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-identification efforts ==

There have been a sizable amount of successful attempts of re-identification in different fields. Even if it is not easy for a lay person to break anonymity, once the steps to do so are disclosed and learnt, there is no need for higher level knowledge to access information in a [[database]]. Sometimes, technical expertise is not even needed if a population has a unique combination of identifiers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Health records ===

In the mid 1990s, a government agency in [[Massachusetts]] called Group Insurance Commission (GIC), which purchased health insurance for employees of the state, decided to release records of hospital visits to any researcher who requested the data, at no cost. GIC assured that the patient's privacy was not a concern since it had removed identifiers such as name, addresses, social security numbers. However, information such as zip codes, birth date and sex remained untouched. The GIC assurance was reinforced by the then governor of Massachusetts, William Weld. [[Latanya Sweeney]], a graduate student at the time, put her mind to picking out the governor's records in the GIC data. By combining the GIC data with the voter database of the city Cambridge, which she purchased for 20 dollars, Governor Weld's record was discovered with ease.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"&gt;Ohm, Paul. 2010. “Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization.” UCLA Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a researcher successfully de-anonymized medical records using voter databases.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2001, Professor Latanya Sweeney again successfully matched anonymized hospital visit records in the state of Washington to individual persons using the state's voting records 43% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney L. Only You, Your Doctor and Many Others May Know. Technology Science. 2015092903. September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are existing algorithms used to re-identify patient with prescription drug information.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Consumer habits and practices ===

Two researchers at the [[University of Texas]], Arvind Narayanan and Professor Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to re-identity some portion of anonymized [[Netflix]] movie-ranking data with individual consumers on the streaming website.  The data was released by Netflix 2006 after de-identification, which consisted of replacing individual names with random numbers and moving around personal details. The two researchers de-anonymized some of the data by comparing it with non-anonymous IMDb (Internet Movie Database) users’ movie ratings. Very little information from the database, it was found, was needed to identify the subscriber.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the resulting research paper, there were startling revelations of how easy it is to re-identify Netflix users. For example, simply knowing data about only two movies a user has reviewed, including the precise rating and the date of rating give or take three days allows for 68% re-identification success.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"/&gt;

In 2006, after [[AOL]] published its users' search queries, data that was anonymized prior to the public release, [[New York Times]] reporters successfully carried out re-identification of individuals by taking groups of searches made by anonymized users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; AOL had attempted to suppress identifying information, including usernames and IP addresses, but had replaced these with unique identification numbers to preserve the utility of this data for researchers. Bloggers, after the release, pored over the data, either trying to identify specific users with this content, or to point out entertaining, depressing, or shocking search queries, examples of which include "how to kill you wife," "depression and medical leave," "car crash photos." Two reporters, Michael Barbro and Tom Zeller, were able to track down a 62 year old widow named Thelma Arnold from recognizing clues to the identity of User 417729 search histories. Arnold acknowledged that she was the author of the searches, confirming that re-identification is possible.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

The individuals whose data is re-identified is also at risk of having their information, with their identity attached it, sold to organizations they do not want possessing private information about their finances, health or preferences. The release of this data may cause anxiety, shame or embarrassment. Once an individual's privacy has been breached as a result of re-identification, future breaches become much easier: once an link is made between one piece of data and a person's real identity, any association between the data and an anonymous identity breaks anonymity of the person.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Re-identification may expose companies which have pledged to assure anonymity to increased liability to contract or to [[tort]] and cause them to violate their privacy policies by having released information to third parties that can identify users after re-identification. Not only will they violate internal policies, institutions may also violate state and federal laws, such laws concerning financial confidentiality or [[medical privacy]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Remedies ==

To address the drawbacks of re-identification, there have been multiple proposals put forward:
* Higher standards and uniform definition of de-identification while retaining data utility: the definition of de-identification should balance privacy protections to reduce re-identification risk with the refusal of companies to delete data &lt;ref name="Lagos, Yianni 2014"/&gt;
* Heightened privacy protections of anonymized information &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Tighter security for databases that store anonymized information &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Strong ban on malicious re-identification, the passing of broader anti-discrimination and privacy legislation that ensures privacy protections as well as encourage participation in data sharing projects and endeavors, as well as establishment of uniform data protection standards in academic communities, such as in the scientific community, in order to minimize privacy violations &lt;ref&gt;Ahn, Sejin. 2015. “COMMENT: Whose Genome Is It Anyway?: Re-identification and Privacy Protection in Public and Participatory Genomics.” San Diego Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A focus on the process of creating data-release policies: making sure de-identification rhetoric is accurate, drawing up contracts that prohibit re-identification attempts and dissemination of sensitive information, establishing data enclaves, and utilizing data-based strategies to match required protection standards to the level of risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Ira S, and Hartzog, Woodrow. 2016. “Anonymization and Risk” Washington Law Review. Retrieved March 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Differential privacy|Differential Privacy]]

While a complete ban on re-identification has been urged, the enforcement of this is impossible. However, there are ways for lawmakers to combat and punish re-identification efforts, if and when they are exposed:pair a ban with harsher penalties and stronger enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], grant victims of re-identification a right of action against those who re-identify them, mandate software audit trails for people who utilize and analyze anonymized data. A small-scale re-identification ban may also be imposed on trusted recipients of particular databases, such as government data miners. This ban would be much easier to enforce and may discourage re-identification in other spheres and in the future.&lt;ref name="Ohm, Paul 2010"/&gt;

An ''English-medium education'' system is one that uses [[English language|English]] as the primary [[medium of instruction]]&amp;mdash;particularly where English is not the mother tongue of the students.

Initially associated with the expansion of English from its homeland in England and the lowlands of [[Scotland]] and its spread to the rest of Great Britain and Ireland, the rise of the British Empire increased the language's spread,&lt;ref name="qub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/imperial.htm |title=The Imperial Archive.

A working knowledge of English is perceived as being valuable; for example, English is very dominant in the [[English in computing|world of computing]]. As a result, many states throughout the world where English is not the predominant language encourage or mandate the use of English as the normal medium of instruction.

===Canada===
{{main|Education in Canada}}
{{further|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories|Official bilingualism in Canada|Timeline of official languages policy in Canada}}
Education is a provincial matter under the [[Canadian constitution, section 92]].  French language rights have been guaranteed in the province of Quebec since the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]], French outside of Quebec and all other minority languages have faced laws against them at one time or another.  English-only education laws were gradually rolled out across Canada during the nineteenth and twentieth century, culminating in the [[Manitoba Schools Question]] 1896 and [[Regulation 17]] in Ontario in 1912, which both attacked French and other European minority languages, and the [[Indian residential schools system]] which attacked Aboriginal languages.

These policies were gradually abolished in the wake of Canada's adoption of official bilingualism (French/English) in 1969 and multiculturalism in 1971, but English remains the predominant language of education outside of Quebec and New Brunswick.

===Wales===
{{see|Welsh medium education}}
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], passed by the [[Parliament of England]], annexing [[Wales]] to the [[Kingdom of England]] are sometimes known as the "Acts of Union."

An often quoted example of the effects on the [[Welsh language]] is the first section of the 1535 Act, which states: "the people of the same dominion have and do daily use a speche nothing like ne consonant to the naturall mother tonge used within this Realme" and then declares the intention "utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs" belonging to Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApknBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44|title=Centres and Peripheries: Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan Journalism in the Twenty First Century|year=2014|isbn=978-1443827577|editor= David Hutchison and Hugh O'Donnell|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 20 of the 1535 Act makes English the only language of the law courts and that those who used Welsh would not be appointed to any public office in Wales: 
{{quote|Also be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Justices, Commissioners, Sheriffs, Coroners, Escheators, Stewards, and their Lieutenants, and all other Officers and Ministers of the Law, shall proclaim and keep the Sessions Courts, Hundreds, Leets, Sheriffs Courts, and all other Courts in the English Tongue;
(2) and all Oaths of Officers, Juries and Inquests, and all other Affidavits, Verdicts and [[Wager of Law]], to be given and done in the English Tongue;
(3) and also that from henceforth no Person or Persons that use the Welsh Speech or Language, shall have or enjoy any manner Office or Fees within this Realm of England, Wales, or other the King's Dominion, upon Pain of forfeiting the same Offices or Fees, unless he or they use and exercise the English Speech or Language.}}

An effect of this language clause was to lay the foundation for creating a thoroughly Anglicised ruling class of landed gentry in Wales, which would have many consequences.

The parts of the 1535 Act relating to language were definitively repealed only in 1993, by the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]], though annotations on the [[Statute Law Database]] copy of the act reads that sections 18–21 were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1887]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In July 1846, the British Government appointed three commissioners to enquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all monoglot English-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CGN/CommsEnq.html |title=Report of Commission of Enquiry into the State of Education in Wales, 1847 |publisher=GENUKI |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners reported to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (The [[Treachery of the Blue Books]]) as, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, Non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as "the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/glencoe-of-welsh-history-is-published-online-6112711.html|title='Glencoe of Welsh history' is published online|date=4 January 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/common.htm |title=CAIN: CSC: The Common School |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=5 May 1993 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in (1596) a recommendation that "the Irish ... be educated in English, in grammar and in science ... for learning hath that wonderful power of itself that it can soften and temper the most stern and savage nature."

The setting up of 'Royal Schools' in Ireland, was proclaimed in 1608 by [[James I]], with the intended purpose "that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion."

These schools provided an English-medium education to the sons of landed settlers in Ireland, most of whom were of Scottish or English descent.

However, only five such schools were actually set up; [[The Royal School, Armagh]] in County Armagh, [[Portora Royal School]] in County Fermanagh, The Cavan Royal School in County Cavan, The [[Royal School Dungannon]] in Tyrone and The Royal and Prior School in County Donegal.

The ''National Education System''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229124833/http://www.proni.gov.uk/Education/Ed2.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sic) was founded in 1831, by the British Government, under the direction of the Chief Secretary, E.G. Stanley. Some 2,500 national schools were established in Ulster in the period 1832–1870, built with the aid of the Commissioners of National Education and local trustees.

Prof. S. Ó Buachalla states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the first four decades of their existence, there is no mention of the Irish language in the programme of regulations of the Commissioners of National Education; furthermore no provision whatsoever was made in 1831 when the original scheme was drawn up for education of those children who spoke Irish only. According to the official opinion of later Commissioners, expressed in a formal reply to the Chief Secretary in 1884, " the anxiety of the promoters of the National Scheme was to encourage the cultivation of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=European Journal of Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=1984 |page=75 |title=Educational Policy and the Role of the Irish Language from 1831 to 1981 |author=Séamas Ó Buachalla |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=1503260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 April 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Irish patriot [[P.H. Pearse]] published a series of studies of the English-medium education system in Ireland. His article entitled The Murder Machine&lt;ref&gt;The Murder Machine http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900007-001/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; embodies an article which appeared in the Irish Review for February 1913.

Pearse wrote in his pamphlet the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And English education in Ireland has seemed: to some like the bed of [[Procustes]], the bed on which all men that passed that way must lie, be it never so big for them, be it never so small for them: the traveller for whom it was too large had his limbs stretched until he filled it; the traveller for whom it was too small had his limbs chopped off until he fitted into it—comfortably. It was a grim jest to play upon travellers. The English have done it to Irish children not by way of jest, but with a purpose. Our English-Irish systems took, and take, absolutely no cognisance of the differences between individuals, of the differences between localities, of the: differences between urban and rural communities, of the differences springing from a different ancestry, Gaelic or Anglo-Saxon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scotland===
{{see|Gaelic medium education in Scotland}}
Attempts were made by legislation, in the later medieval and early modern period, to establish English at first among the aristocracy and increasingly amongst all ranks by education acts and parish schools. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed some ten such acts between 1494 and 1698.

In 1609 nine Gaelic [[tribal chief|chieftains]] were abducted and forced to sign the [[Statutes of Iona]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040718082847/http://www.saorsamedia.com/library/gaelicinscotland.html Gaelic in Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem to have been designed specifically to [[Anglicize]] leaders and institutions of Gaelic society, in order to bring it under control of central government.

Among the items listed in this agreement was the "planting of the gospell among these rude, barbarous, and uncivill people" by Protestant churches; the outlawing of bards who were traditionally on circuit between the houses of noblemen; the requirement that all men of wealth send their heirs to be educated in Lowland schools where they would be taught to "speik, reid, and wryte Inglische."

The then King [[James VI]], followed this by the [[School Establishment Act 1616]], which sought to establish schools in every parish in the [[Scottish Highlands]] so that "the youth be exercised and trayned up in civilitie, godlines, knawledge, and learning, that the vulgar Inglische toung be universallie plantit, and the Irische language, whilk is one of the chief and principall causes of the continewance of barbaritie and incivilitie amongis the inhabitantis of the Ilis and Heylandis, may be abolisheit and removeit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqE0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95&amp;lpg=PT95|title=Gaelic Scotland: The Transformation of a Culture Region|author=Charles W. J. Withers|date=July 1990|journal=[[Geographical Review]]|volume=80|number=3|pages=327–329|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1709 the [[Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge]] (SSPCK) was established in order to further funding sources for Highland church schools. All manner of incentives and punishments were used to stop children from speaking [[Scottish Gaelic]]. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending. At first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic-English vocabulary, then in 1766 brought in a [[New Testament]] with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. After a number of years of unsuccessful attempts at English-only teaching methods, it was realized that literacy in Gaelic was a much more effective means of teaching and a bridge towards fluency in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkX2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61|page=61|title=National Literacy Campaigns: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|first1=R.F.|last1=Arnove|first2=H.J.|last2=Graff|isbn=978-0-306-42458-8|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1918 education acts have provided for teaching Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, but development was very slow until Gaelic
became an initial teaching medium in the Gaelic areas of [[Inverness-shire]] and [[Ross-shire]] from 1958. In 1975 the newly created [[Western Isles]] education authority introduced bilingual [[primary education]] shortly followed by [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] Region in [[Skye]]. Gaelic-medium primary education commenced with two schools in 1985, growing to 42 units by 1993/94.

In [[secondary education]], Gaelic has long been taught as a subject—often through the medium of English, even to native speakers. A move towards bilingual secondary education in the [[Western Isles]] was frustrated by a change of government in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 United Kingdom general election]]. Gaelic-medium secondary education has developed less satisfactorily. [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic-medium streams]] followed on from primary in [[Glasgow]] and [[Inverness]], with some experimentation in the Western Isles, but the sector is hampered by acute teacher shortage, and an [[Ofsted]] inspectorate report of 1994 regarded Gaelic-medium secondary education as divisive and inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/gaelic/an/i1/i1.html#2.3(Glasgow) |title=Euromosaic – Gaelic in Scotland (United Kingdom) |publisher=Uoc.es |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third level provision through Gaelic is provided by [[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]] (literally: "the great barn at Ostaig") a Gaelic-medium college based in [[Sleat]], on the Isle of Skye in north west Scotland. It is part of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]], and also has a campus on [[Islay]] known as [[Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle]].

In 2004, [[Prince Charles]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], (who is patron of the College) stated  that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The beauty of Gaelic music and song is inescapable. But without the living language, it risks becoming an empty shell. That is why an education system, up to the level represented by the college here in Skye, is so important – to ensure fluency and literacy which will continue to renew the health and creativity of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/speeches/speech-hrh-the-prince-charles-duke-of-rothesay-sabhal-mor-ostaig-isle-of-skye|title=A speech by HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, at Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Isle of Skye|work=princeofwales.gov.uk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]] is the first piece of legislation to give formal recognition to the Gaelic language in Scotland.  It recognises Gaelic as an official language of Scotland, commanding "equal respect" with English.

Education Minister [[Peter Peacock]], who has ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: "This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=4560&amp;i=34453|title=Official Report|date=2 February 2005|publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]]|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall===
[[File:DSCN1948PenrynPrayerBookRebellionMemorial.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], Prayer Book Rebellion Memorial, near the site of [[Glasney College]].]] In the [[Prayer Book rebellion]] of 1549, where the English state sought to suppress [[Cornish language]] speaking with the introduction of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which was made available only in English. In replacing [[Latin]] with English, and under the guise of suppressing Catholicism, English was effectively imposed as the language of the Church, with the intent of it becoming the language of the people. At the time people in many areas of [[Cornwall]] did not speak or understand English.

The forced introduction of English to church services in Cornwall  provided a major reason for the rebellion. The articles of the rebels states: "and we the cornyshe men (whereof certen of vs vnderstande no Englysh) vtterly refuse thys new English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Looking at the Mermaid: A Reader in Cornish Literature 900-1900|page=267|editor=[[Alan M. Kent]], [[Tim Saunders]]|publisher=Francis Boutle Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-1903427019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British Raj===

British records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_goyal_education.htm |title=Education in Pre-British India |publisher=Infinityfoundation.com |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. Subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students from all classes of society. Gandhi is said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed by British rule.

The [[Charter Act]] of 1813 decreed that English would be taught in the Indian education system although not as a replacement for indigenous languages. Instead, it was anticipated that English would co-exist with Oriental studies as a means by which moral law could be reinforced.

The 1817 publication of James Mill's ''History of British India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=0sITK8fQAK-wEdh_22v1sG6&amp;id=4c8NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1 |title=The history of British India, Volume 6 |author=James Mill, Horace Hayman Wilson |publisher=James Madden |year=1847 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved to be a defining text in the theories of how education policies should be formed (ed. Horace Hayman Wilson: London, Piper, Stephenson and Spence, 1858). Mill advocated the introduction of European knowledge to counter balance Indian traits judged to be irrational. Instilling ideals of reason would accordingly 'reform' Indians by the example of Western systems of thought and outlook. His ideas discredited Indian culture, language and literature even as its assumptions of moral superiority authorised and justified the presence of the British in India.

The current system of education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |title=Western Education in Nineteenth-Century India |publisher=Qub.ac.uk |date=4 June 1998 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415132111/http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofEnglish/imperial/india/educate.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced and funded by the British in the 19th century, following recommendations by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.

Thomas MacAulay's infamous 'Minute On Indian Education' (1835) encapsulates both the overt and covert agendas for such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Macaulay's Children'  is used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle. It is usually used in a derogatory fashion, and the connotation is one of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage.

The passage to which the term refers is from his 'Minute on Indian Education' delivered in 1835. It reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1835 Lord William Bentninck revitalised the earlier Charter Act with his New Education Policy which determined that English should be the official language of the courts, diplomacy and administration. Prior to this Persian had been the accepted language of diplomacy. Bentninck's motive was ostensibly to "regenerate" society, but the ramifications were boundless. From this moment on only those with Western style education and a knowledge of English were eligible for government employment or for a career in public life.

In 1854 Sir Charles Wood published his Education Dispatch which was aimed at widening the availability of Western oriented knowledge. Universities were established under the London examining model in [[Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and [[Madras]].

Lord Ripon's Hunter Commission of 1882 somewhat belatedly advocated that there should be increased provision of education at primary level and for women. The theory was that there would be a subsequent rise in the calibre of applicants for third level entry.

The inevitable result was that an Indian-based education was viewed as being second rate in comparison to an English-medium education.

===India===
Private English medium schools are gaining popularity throughout India as urban middle class Indians who feel that English is  the global language send their children to these schools. Increasingly, many poor families too are sending their children to English medium schools due the poor quality of education in Government run vernacular medium schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Malaysia===
{{main|Education in Malaysia}}
Up until 1981 in [[West Malaysia]] (and some years later in [[East Malaysia]]), there were English-medium schools set up by the former British colonial government and Christian missionaries. However, following the implementation of the 1967 National Language Act which stipulated the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay-medium schools; all English-medium schools were definitely phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Hickey|title=Standards of English: Codified Varieties around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2kgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85121-3|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has now caused many newly graduates to become unemployed as they cannot find jobs especially in the [[private sector]] due to the lack of English proficiency; with the graduates can only depends on [[public sector]] jobs provided by the government.

===Indonesia===
English medium school in Indonesia consists of [[International school]] and [[National Plus school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian National "Plus" and International Schools|url=http://www.expat.or.id/orgs/plusschools.html|work=Living in Indonesia|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A National Plus school in Indonesia refers to a school that offers education beyond the minimum requirements of the national Indonesian accreditation authorities. National Plus school offers some subjects taught in English  and may provide some native English speakers on staff or may offer international curriculum such as from [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) or the [[International Baccalaureate Organisation]] (IBO).
National Plus schools can typically be differentiated from international schools by their core market. International schools tend to primarily exist to serve the needs of expatriate students and national plus schools for Indonesian students; however there is significant overlap on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guides for Foreign Residents &amp; Expats|url=http://livinginindonesia.info/item/national-plus-schools/|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

The Government of [[Pakistan]] has recently{{when|date=February 2018}} announced the introduction of English lessons on a phased basis to all schools across the country. This new policy states that "English language has been made compulsory from Class-1 onwards" and the "Introduction of English as medium of instruction for science, mathematics, computer science and other selected subjects like economics and geography in all schools in a graduated manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.pk/  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208235230/http://www.moe.gov.pk/ |date=8 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caretaker Minister for Education Mr. Shujaat Ali Beg declared 25 January 2008 that 18 colleges of the city of Karachi would be made ''"Model English Medium Colleges,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interface.edu.pk/students/Jan-08/English-medium-colleges.asp|title=18 colleges declared 'English medium'|work=interface.edu.pk|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===

In [[Bangladesh]] the system of education is divided into three different branches. Students are free to choose anyone of them provided that they have the means. These branches are: The English Medium, The Bengali Medium, and The Religious Branch. In the English Medium system, courses are all taught in English using English books with the exception for Bengali and Arabic. English medium schools are mainly private and thus traditionally were reserved for the upper and upper middle class. However huge demand in urban areas has resulted in large number of English-medium schools mushrooming. This has caused a fall in quality. O and A level exams are arranged through the [[British Council]] in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307131603/http://sanisoft.tripod.com/bdeshedu/systems.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 March 2001 |title=Education in Bangladesh |publisher=Sanisoft.tripod.com |accessdate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Union of Myanmar===

In the [[Burma|Union of Myanmar]], the education system is based on the British Colonial model, due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences. Nearly all schools are government-operated, and also there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools.

===The Philippines===
The United States of America won the [[Philippine–American War]] (1898–1901), and declared the Philippines a US colony. US imperial rule followed. [[Tomás Mac Síomóin|Mac Síomóin]] quotes the Filipino scholar [[E. San Juan]] who made the following comment regarding the use made by the US administration of the English language to rule his country:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its conquest of hegemony or consensual rule was literally accomplished through the deployment of English as the official medium of business, schooling and government. This pedagogical strategy was designed to cultivate an intelligencia, a middle stratum divorced from its roots in the plebeian masses, who would service the ideological apparatus of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Americanization was mediated through English, sanctioned as the language of prestige and aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;'Ó Mhársa go Magla' by Tomás Mac Síomóin. First published in 2006. ISSN 1649-3079&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English is used for instruction at the [[University of the Philippines]].

===Slovenia===
[[University of Ljubljana]] teaches at least 100 courses in English.  In ''[[Where to Invade Next]]'', Michael Moore interviews several American citizens studying at the university who were taking courses taught in English.

===South Africa===

====Colonial education====
The earliest European schools in South Africa were established in the Cape Colony in the late seventeenth century by Dutch Reformed Church elders committed to biblical instruction, which was necessary for church confirmation. In rural areas, itinerant teachers (meesters) taught basic literacy and math skills. British mission schools proliferated after 1799, when the first members of the London Missionary Society arrived in the Cape Colony.[8]

Language soon became a sensitive issue in education. At least two dozen English-language schools operated in rural areas of the Cape Colony by 1827, but their presence rankled among devout Afrikaners, who considered the English language and curriculum irrelevant to rural life and Afrikaner values. Throughout the nineteenth century, Afrikaners resisted government policies aimed at the spread of the English language and British values, and many educated their children at home or in the churches.

====Milner Schools====
In order to anglicize the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] area during the [[Anglo Boer war]], [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] set out to influence British Education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the "Milner Schools" in South Africa. These schools consist of modern day [[Pretoria High School for Girls]], [[Pretoria Boys High School]], [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], Hamilton Primary School, and St. Marys DSG.

===China===
{{main|Education in China}}
A number of universities are involved English-medium education by International Scholarly Exchange Curriculum program (ISEC program). ISEC program establishes a platform for those universities to communicate with other international institutions who use English-medium education. Other famous universities that offer English-medium education (China-Foreign cooperative universities), such as [[University of Nottingham Ningbo, China]], [[United International College]], [[Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University]], Shanghai Newyork University and Wenzhou-Kean University.

== Feminist Bookstores ==

[[Feminist bookstore]]s hold a part of the second-wave feminism movement inside their stores, with expansion of the bookstores beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/business-feminism/#!|title=Business Feminism - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 there were around 100 bookstores located in North America, which created over $400 million in sales annually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are still 13 feminist-run bookstores in the world today.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; There is only one in Canada and the rest are spread throughout the United States, with the oldest bookstore, Antigone Books, in [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; The 13 book stores host feminist events to support feminism as well as carry books about the topics of [[Queer theory|queer theories]], [[animal rights]], lesbian fiction, gay studies, and also information about different cultures.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

The decline in feminist bookstores is due to the competition of E-Books, corporate chains, online stores, and the presence of Amazon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/online/fall-bookstores/|title=Brick and Mortar: Lessons About the Future of Bookselling  {{!}}  Harvard Political Review|website=harvardpolitics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These competitors make independent bookstores face financial difficulties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recent studies show that consumers still want both the hard copy and digital copy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Besides big corporations coming in and taking business, it was also hard for feminist bookstores to keep up with the competitions distribution, publishing, as well as the ability to sell books to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Notable stores include [[Amazon Bookstore Cooperative]] and [[Silver Moon Bookshop]].

== Feminist Economic Alliance ==
During the Thanksgiving of 1975, the founding women of the Feminist Economic Alliance (FEA) met in Detroit, Michigan at a conference to discuss the problems women faced with money.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/wlmpc_wlmms01003/|title=Feminist Economic Alliance Formed to Aid New Sister Credit Unions|website=Duke Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two leading women for the alliance in 1975 were [[Susan Osborne]] and Linda Maslanko, both from New York.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They were the spokeswomen for FEA and educated the public on what the alliance meant and what the future of FEA looked like after splitting into eight geographic regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Feminist Economic Alliance was created to aid new sister credit unions as well as allowing any women to become economically powerful, independent, or grow as an individual.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This independence for women was going to be achieved by encouraging, assisting, and promoting the women of feminist credit unions and feminist enterprises.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The main idea behind this new alliance was that older sister credit unions could help the new developing credit unions by sharing research, resources, and guidance in the process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Feminist Credit Unions ==
In the 1970s during the second wave feminist movement, women had the urge to fight unequal credit so they created their own non-profit, financial institutions so that men were no longer in control of their money.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/27/archives/feminists-open-own-credit-union-slew-haven-office-for-loans-ends.html|title=Feminists Open Own Credit Union|last=Knight|first=Michael|date=1974-08-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-manager of the union, Susan Osborne, was creating an environment for women to save money as well as help other women in need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By creating their own credit unions, women were able to avoid being discriminated based on their gender even though the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 banned credit unions from discriminating potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebhc.org/financial-feminism-credit-unions-women%E2%80%99s-movement-1970s|title=Abstract: Financial Feminism: Credit Unions in the Women's Movement of the 1970s {{!}} The Business History Conference|website=thebhc.org|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women being excluded from receiving loans despite the law in place, were divorced women, low-income women, women needing legal money or women on welfare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Establishing feminist credit unions meant that they would now be able to receive loans hassle free, save their money, and gain money management counseling.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19760109&amp;id=XXQjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V40EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7255,1595578&amp;hl=en|title=Sarasota Journal - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When receiving credit, women are viewed by their individual character rather than if they were married or single.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A woman no longer has to be the co-signer, she can now be in control of her money.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The unions run no differently than any other union, in fact, the feminist credit unions are governed by the same laws as the normal credit unions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Detroit, Michigan branch ===
In 1982, the Detroit, Michigan branch, the last feminist credit union, was dissolved due to financial problems and also the reconstruction of the unions language change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcul.org/industry-and-program-resources/publications-and-multimedia/news?article_id=27153|title=Forty-Four Years Ago a Female-Run Credit Union Paved the Way for Women's Financial Independence|work=Michigan Credit Union League|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was suggested to be changed to include both genders, not just female.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Michigan Credit Union League saw the feminist credit unions as bias towards men and suggestions of equal consideration for males in a female position were to be given resulting in it being dissovled.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Feminist Mail-Order Magazines ==

=== History ===

The feminist mail-order magazine came from Great Britain around the 1970s and lasted until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib/articles/feminist-collectives|title=Feminist collectives|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collectives were notable for allowing women to take equal parts in the creation of the magazine in all areas including: copy typing, design, layout or interviewing.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; By allowing women the equal chance at learning, women were developing their creativity and gaining new skills.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women were allowed to fight back at the patriarchal system by voicing their opinions and allowing women who were excluded also have a platform.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Excluded women during that time were black, lesbian, working class, or single mothers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Popular magazines at the time were [[Spare Rib]], Scarlet Woman, Catcall, and Outwrite.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The magazines were not afraid to comment about inequalities the women were facing or issues that needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6bhrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=scarlet+woman+magazine+1970#v=onepage&amp;q=scarlet%20woman%20magazine%201970&amp;f=false|title=Magazine Movements: Women's Culture, Feminisms and Media Form|last=Forster|first=Laurel|date=2015-02-26|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781441172631|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist activities were also talked about in the magazines creating networks, reformation, expressing opinions or attitudes relating to a certain topic.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mail-order magazines were a way for women to become educated on feminism and how to join the movement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The earliest form of feminist restaurants took shape in suffrage restaurants, tea rooms, or lunch rooms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefeministrestaurantproject.com/|title=Women’s restaurants|last=|first=|date=2013-06-18|work=Restaurant-ing through history|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food was sold at a low cost of five or ten cents and men were permitted to eat, in hopes of women persuading men to support a certain political cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These restaurants suffered from conflicts dealing with the founders and donators.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Alva Belmont]], a wealthy socialite, was the founder of a suffrage restaurant that was known for strict rules and a fast pace.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ideas and motives behind these suffrage restaurants in the 1910s were the foundations for the feminist restaurants in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In April 1972, the first feminist restaurant, Mother Courage, was founded by [[Dolores Alexander]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Feminist restaurants are used more as a place to gather and socialize rather than eating.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The restaurants were used to share ideas, literature, educate one another and to promote the feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Guest speakers, political speakers, poets, or musicians would come to the restaurants to promote issues or spread awareness.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministrestaurantproject.com/|title=The Feminist Restaurant Project|website=thefeministrestaurantproject.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee houses and cafes are also popular among the feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Restaurants offered same pay to every staff member, which was entirely women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The style was simple and supported the movements that were occurring during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They support other occupations by avoiding certain products such as lettuce and grapes for the farmers or boycotting orange juice for the anti-gay campaign.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Feminist restaurants were also notable for treating women or lesbians with respect in a non-hostile environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A women who is dining with a man will be given a wine sample as well as the check at the end of the meal.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That was typical not the case in restaurants that were not catered to feminism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Feminist Businesses Today ==

In today's society, feminist businesses look different besides the few bookstores left in the world.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; There are over hundreds of companies created by women, that have a purpose besides making money such as changing our society, impacting employers and the consumers they reach.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bi-100-the-creators-women-2016-6|title=22 successful women-led companies that prove there's much more to business than profits|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One famous company started by a woman that has been successful is [[Tory Burch]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; She created the store from nothing and has been able to create a multibillion-dollar business as well as a foundation called the Tory Burch Foundation in 2009, to help empower women and female entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Today feminist business are about empowering women in the shape of products sold, campaigns run, and businesses created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298982|title=Redefining Modern Feminism in the World of Business|last=Shah|first=Ameera|date=2017-08-18|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26046">The '''feminist pathways perspective''' is a feminist perspective of [[criminology]] which suggests victimization throughout the life course is a key risk factor for women's entry into offending.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Davidson, Janet T.

== Victimization ==
{{Main|Victimisation}}
Victimization has profound psychological consequences and impacts the social development of an individual.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macmillan|first=Ross|date=2001|title=Violence and the Life Course: The Consequences of Victimization for Personal and Social Development|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable evidence that victimization is a precursor to involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While victimization is a risk factor for both men and women's criminal behavior, it is a stronger predictor for women.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cauffman|first=Elizabeth|date=2008|title=Understanding the Female Offender|jstor=20179981|journal=The Future of Children|volume=18|issue=2|pages=119–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both men and women may experience victimization in their lifetime, women experience and respond to victimization differently than men due to [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Offender: Girls, Women, and Crime|last=Chesney-Lind|first=Meda|publisher=Sage Publication|year=1997|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incarcerated women experience higher rates of victimization than both incarcerated men and the general female population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opsal|first=Tara|last2=Foley|first2=Allison|date=2013|title=Making it on the Outside: Understanding Barriers to Women's Post-Incarceration Reintegration|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=7|issue=4|pages=265–277|doi=10.1111/soc4.12026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s imprisonment is frequently attributed to [[Addiction|drug addiction]], [[prostitution]], and retaliation to an abuser.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeHart|first=Dana D.|date=2008|title=Pathways to Prison Impact of Victimization in the Lives of Incarcerated Women|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/14/12/1362|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1362–1381|doi=10.1177/1077801208327018|pmid=19008544}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these attributions are characterized as crimes, research has also begun to conceptualize them as survival strategies to cope with victimization.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; A young girl, for example, may run away from an abusive home and turn to prostitution as a way to make a living. Literature on victimization has often created a division between victims and offenders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deadman|first=Derek|last2=MacDonald|first2=Ziggy|date=2004|title=Offenders as Victims of Crime?: An Investigation into the Relationship between Criminal Behaviour and Victimization|jstor=3559799|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|volume=167|issue=1|pages=53–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these two groups are not as separate as was once understood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It was not until the 1970s that research analyzed victimization, traumas, and past abuse as factors that can influence women to commit crimes. In the early 20th century, the personal histories of women in crime were not a focus of research. Early literature suggested women were antisocial due to their biology, environment, and socialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Cesare Lombroso|Lombroso]], for instance, distinguished female offenders from non-offenders based on their physical anatomies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Offender|last=Lombroso|first=Cesare|last2=Ferrero|first2=Guglielmo|last3=Morrison|first3=William Douglas|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|year=1895|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early explanatory factors were understood [[Individualistic culture|individualistically]] outside of a [[Social environment|social-historical context]].

=== Connection to criminal activity ===
There is a well-documented association between criminal behavior and victimization among female offenders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That said, the age and gendered patterns of victimization risk, context, and consequences are highly visible and exacerbated among incarcerated women. There is evidence to support that women involved with crime often have extensive histories of physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Female offenders are more likely to have been abused than male offenders&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and more likely to have been victimized than female non-offenders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A survey of national correctional populations found that over half of female inmates have been physically or sexually abused, compared to fewer than one in five male inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Literature suggests female offenders' victimization often begins at a young age and persists through her lifetime.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browne|first=Angela|last2=Miller|first2=Brenda|last3=Maguin|first3=Eugene|date=1999|title=Prevalence and Severity of Lifetime Physical and Sexual Victimization Among Incarcerated Women|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252799000114|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=301–322|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(99)00011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two thirds of incarcerated women have experienced at least one event of abuse by age eleven.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Ninety-two percent of girls under 18 in the California [[Juvenile court|juvenile justice system]] report having faced emotional, sexual, or physical abuse. Eighty percent of women in prison in the United States have experienced an event of physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This lifetime of violence is "pervasive and severe."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The literature suggests that the prevalence of victimization among incarcerated women and its cumulative impact indicates that victimization is a central factor for women's entry into crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Demographics of victimization ==
The feminist pathways perspective is not meant to suggest that victimization is unique to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Instead, this perspective addresses how gender impacts the experience of victimization, and how this difference in experience paves the path to crime for women. An individual's risk of victimization is shaped by environmental context, social networks, and demographics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Life course approach|Life course researchers]] maintain that people are exposed to violence to various degrees based on their location, socioeconomic circumstance, and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to the lifestyle exposure perspective, sociodemographic traits give rise to lifestyle differences which may put an individual at an increased risk of victimization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Criminal Victimization in Eight American Cities|last=Hindelang|first=Michael|publisher=Ballinger|year=1976|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone from a low-income neighborhood who spends time in public places at night and among strangers may be more likely to encounter offenders, and therefore at a greater risk of victimization.

=== Age ===
[[File:Age of victimization chart.png|thumb|Estimated Rates (Per 1,000 Persons 12 Years of Age or Older) of Personal Victimization, By Age (Hindelang 1976)|472x472px]]
Age is strongly associated with victimization risk, especially for property and violent crimes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Victimization tends to be concentrated early in life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Young people are significantly more likely to experience violent victimization than older adults.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Victimization risk peaks between ages 16 and 19.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]], the risk of victimization increases by 8 percent from ages 12 to 15 and 16 to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics- 1998|last=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crime opportunity theory|opportunity perspective]] attributes this tendency to the way social activities are structured by age. Young adults are more likely to be in situations where they can be exposed to offenders, or engage in activities where they can be easily targeted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The young age at which the risk of victimization peaks has significant implications on the psychological and social development of the victim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Childhood is a [[critical period]] of growth, and child victims, according to the [[Cycle of violence|cycle of violence thesis]], will be more likely to be involved in violent crime in the future.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus, victimization during developmental years has the potential to disrupt the normal maturation of an individual, and shape the paths this individual may take– including the pathway to prison.

=== Gender ===
Gender shapes the risk, context, and consequences of victimization.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to government statistics, with the exception of rape, men are more likely than women to be victims of all violent crimes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women are underrepresented as victims in official data, and are much more likely than men to be targets of certain types of victimization, such as [[rape]] and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women are more likely to have been victims of [[child abuse]] than men&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asscher|first=Jessica|last2=Put|first2=Claudia|last3=Stams|first3=Geert Jan J. M.|date=2015|title=Gender Differences in the Impact of Abuse and Neglect Victimization on Adolescent Offending Behavior|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=30|issue=2|pages=215–225|doi=10.1007/s10896-014-9668-4|pmid=25663744|pmc=4315896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more likely to have experienced abuse at an early age.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The way victimization is gendered also impacts how women experience and respond to their victimization. Although victimization during childhood or adolescence is a predictor for female and male offending, the literature suggests it is a stronger predictor for females.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Researchers provides multiple explanations for why victimization has such a prominent effect on women’s future delinquency. Girls grow up in what [[Meda Chesney-Lind|Chesney-Lind]] describes as a “different world”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; than boys, and therefore experience a different form of [[socialization]]. Feminist criminologists argue that women adapt to traumas differently than men due to gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Women tend to have limited opportunities to cope with stress openly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dornfeld|first=Maude|last2=Kruttschnitt|first2=Candace|date=1992|title=Do the Stereotypes Fit? Mapping Gender-Specific Outcomes and Risk Factors|url=|journal=Criminology|language=|volume=30|issue=3|pages=397–420|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1992.tb01110.x|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is thought that women  internalize traumas as feelings of worthlessness, fear, or distress.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, the negative effect of stressors is magnified in women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The literature proposes that gendered expectations and gender roles also shape how traumas impact women differently than men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For instance, society teaches women that they are values by the strength of their [[Social network|familial and social networks]]. That said, poor interpersonal relationships are a stronger risk factor for female offending than male offending.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Trauma theorists argue that traumas are rarely treated professionally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women, therefore, may adapt to victimization by turning to activities or substances, like drugs, that are considered criminal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These crimes can be framed as coping strategies.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Polyvictimization ===
Polyvictimization refers to experiencing different and simultaneous episodes of victimization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most incarcerated women who have experienced victimization have survived multiple traumas over a lifespan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These repeated traumas have an aggregate impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A disproportionally high number of all victimizations account for polyvictimizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women are more likely to be polyvictimized than men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is likely because females are more likely to be abused than males, and find themselves in abusive relationships from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Research has recognized both the prevalence and mounting consequences of repeat victimization. Polyvictimization can disrupt multiple relationships and aspects of a woman’s life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ripple effects of these disruptions can push a woman off the "path of normalcy."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is evidence that unrelenting traumas in the early stages of a young girl’s life can lead her to act criminally or "out of the mainstream"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Main Routes from Victimization to Crime ===
Women's victimization has both direct and indirect effects that relate to women's criminal behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among the many traumas female offenders experience in a lifetime, child abuse and partner abuse have well-documented associations with female criminal behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Child abuse ====
[[File:Sample Pathways From Victimization to Crime.png|thumb|Sample pathways from child abuse to crime. Inspired by DeHart (2008).|470x470px]]
Female [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]] are more frequently victims of sexual or physical abuse than male juvenile delinquents.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Eighty-two percent of the incarcerated women interviewed by Browne, Miller, and Maguin&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; at the [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|Bedford Hills Maximum Security Correctional Facility]] were abused during childhood, and nearly 60 percent had been sexually abused by a parental figure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Research suggests that girls experience [[child abuse]]– both physical and sexual –differently than boys.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For instance, girls are more likely to have experienced penetrative abuse and less likely to have been physically abused.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Childhood victimization is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior and future mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anumba|first=Natalie|last2=Dematteo|first2=David|last3=Heilbrun|first3=Kirk|date=2012|title=Social Functioning, Victimization, and Mental Health among Female Offenders|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/39/9/1204|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1204–1218|doi=10.1177/0093854812443489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the gender differences in child abuse experience, the association between child abuse and delinquency is also distinct for males and females. According to data collected from the Washington State Court Juvenile Assessment data, physical child abuse is a strong predictor of women's violent behavior.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, there is little research on the specific mechanism that links childhood victimization and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist criminologists understand childhood victimization as a structured theme throughout the lives of incarcerated women. The long-term effects of childhood victimization are essential to understanding how women become incarcerated. For some women, childhood victimization directly relates to their involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women|last=Richie|first=Beth|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=London|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these situations, children may be "missocialized" by caregivers who offer them drugs, force them to steal, or exploit them as prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Child abuse|Childhood victimization]] also has indirect links to future offending. There is evidence that girls from abusive households are more at risk to run away before adulthood, therefore subjecting themselves to an increased risk of becoming involved with drugs or prostitution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The majority of female juvenile offenders report that their first arrest was for running away from an abusive home.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Prostitution]], [[property crime]]s, and [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]] become means of survival for young female runaways.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, women who were physically or sexually abused as children by caretakers have a significantly higher risk of drug abuse and addiction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Some young women become dependent on drugs to desensitize themselves from their traumatic histories.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's involvement in drugs or [[prostitution]] then significantly increases their chances of arrest or incarceration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Partner abuse ====
Studies have observed large numbers of incarcerated women who experienced [[intimate partner violence]] prior to incarceration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Seventy-five percent of the women studied by Browne, Miller, and Maguin&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; at the [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|Bedford Hills Maximum Security Correctional Facility]] reported histories of partner abuse. Rates of partner abuse among female offenders are higher than those among male offenders.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Harlow, Caroline Wolf. (1999). ''Prior Abuse Reported by Inmates and Probationers (Report No. NCJ 172879)''. Washington, DC: Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; A national correctional population survey from 1999 found that 61.3 percent of women had been abused by an intimate partner prior to incarceration, compared to only 5.9 percent of men.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Research on incarcerated women suggests there is an association between childhood sexual assault and adulthood sexual assault.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; This suggests that a lifetime of victimization is characteristic of the female offender.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raj|first=Anita|last2=Rose|first2=Jennifer|last3=Decker|first3=Michele R.|last4=Rosengard|first4=Cynthia|last5=Hebert|first5=Megan R.|last6=Stein|first6=Michael|last7=Clarke|first7=Jennifer G.|date=2008|title=Prevalence and Patterns of Sexual Assault Across the Life Span Among Incarcerated Women|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/14/5/528|journal=Violence Against Women|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=528–541|doi=10.1177/1077801208315528|issn=|pmid=18408171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partner abuse is common within this lifetime of victimization.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Intimate partner violence has both direct and indirect implications for a woman's entry into crime.

Some feminist criminologists suggest that partner abuse coerces, if not forces, women to become involved in crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In these situations, an abusive partner may entrap a woman into crime.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org|title=Women's Experiences of Abuse as a Risk Factor for Incarceration|last=Gilfus|first=Mary|date=2002|website=|publisher=VAWnet: A Project of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence/Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that incarcerated women were forced by their partners– through physical attacks or threats –to commit murders, robbery, check fraud,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sell or carry drugs.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Richie observed this gender entrapment among battered African-American women in New York City jails, whom she described as being "compelled to crime."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Economic abuse|Financially abusive]] partners may manipulate women into debt until they are left with no resources, and as a result, are more likely to turn to criminal activities to support themselves.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Partner abuse also has indirect effects on the pathway to crime. There is evidence that women are sometimes implicated for crimes related to their partner abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some women, for example, retaliated against their abuser and were imprisoned for homicide-related charges.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some women were implicated in the abuse of their children, who were also harmed by the abusive partner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Research also finds that victims of intimate partner violence are likely to be involved with drugs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Drugs are either introduced by the abuser,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; or they become a self-medicated coping mechanism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Abusive partners sometimes isolate a woman from her social networks, thus structurally dislocating her from all legitimate institutions, such as family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Regina|date=1990|title=Processes of Victimization and Criminalization of Black Women|jstor=29766565|journal=Social Justice|volume=17.3|issue=41|pages=153–166|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women reported feeling a sense of rejection and worthlessness as a result of this isolation, and often coped by using drugs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Battered women are surrounded by extreme stress and can become dependent on these substances.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Obtaining drugs puts these women at an increased risk of arrest.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Critique of the victimization explanation ==

=== Women's agency ===

The feminist perspective on crime is sometimes criticized for overemphasizing or disregarding women's agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexed Work: Gender, Race, and Resistance in a Brooklyn Drug Market|last=Maher|first=Lisa|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional feminist approaches to women in crime often overlook women's locations in society and place too much emphasis on women's individual choices.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Criminology|last=Schram|first=Pamela|last2=Tibbetts|first2=Stephen|publisher=Sage Publication|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4833-0228-7|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=307–309|chapter=Chapter 11: Feminist Theories of Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paints female offenders as active participants who are compelled to act criminally. In contrast, some research strips women of their agency and portrays them as "passive victims of oppressive social structures, relations, and substances, or some combination thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invisible Woman: Gender, Crime, and Justice|last=Belknap|first=Joanne|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Stamford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal perpetuates the notion that women are always submissive to social structures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Critics hold that it is essential for research on women in crime to consider both the social-historical context and the woman's individual motivations.

=== Intersectionality ===

Although the feminist pathways perspective attempts to differentiate the experience of men and women in crime, it does not take into account the complex factors that also impact a woman's experiences and histories, such as race and class.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some critics argue that a "feminist" perspective too often only considers the experiences of a white, middle-class woman.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Just as gender acts as an organizing principle in society, race and class also shape opportunity structures and social positions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Through the Prism of Difference|last=Zinn|first=Maxine Baca|last2=Hondagneu-Sotelo|first2=Pierrette|last3=Denissen|first3=Amy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A suburban upper-class, white woman, for instance, will likely encounter different forms of victimization in her lifetime than a lower-income, African American woman who lives in a crime-ridden neighborhood. An [[Intersectionality|intersectional]], or interlocking, perspective takes into account that other social identities impact an individual's victimization and path into crime. [[White feminism|Multicultural feminism]] is necessary to fully understand how social identities interact with traumatic life course events to pave the way to prison.

=== Separating offenders and victims ===

Feminist scholars have strongly discouraged researchers from portraying female offenders and victims as mutually exclusive groups.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Instead, critics argue the line between them should be blurred because women's involvement in crime is so often linked to their subordinate social positions, which make them vulnerable to victimization.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilfus|first=Mary|date=1993|title=From Victims to Survivors to Offenders|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=4|issue=1|pages=63–89|doi=10.1300/J012v04n01_04|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Critics hold that women can only be understood as criminals if they are also understood as victims, necessitating fluidity between offenders and victims.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">In [[general relativity]] the light is assumed to propagate in the [[vacuum]] along [[null geodesic]] in a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. Besides the geodesics principle in a [[classical field theory]] there exists the [[Fermat's principle]] for [[stationary spacetime|stationary gravity fields]].&lt;ref name = "Land"&gt;{{Citation|author=Landau, Lev D.|authorlink=Lev Landau|author2= Lifshitz, Evgeny F.| author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz|title=The Classical Theory of Fields (4th ed.)|location=London|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|date=1980|isbn=9780750627689| page = 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fermat's principle ==

In more general case for [[Conformal manifold|conformally]] [[stationary spacetime]] &lt;ref name = "Perl"&gt;{{Citation|author= Perlik, Volker |title=Gravitational Lensing from a Spacetime Perspective|journal= Living Rev. Relativ.| volume=7| date=2004| issue=9|at=Chapter 4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with [[coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(t,x^1,x^2,x^3) &lt;/math&gt; a Fermat [[Metric tensor|metric]] takes form

:&lt;math&gt;g=e^{2f(t,x)}[(dt+\phi_{\alpha}(x)dx^{\alpha})^{2}-\hat{g}_{\alpha\beta} dx^{\alpha} dx^{\beta}]&lt;/math&gt;,

where conformal factor &lt;math&gt;f(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; depending on time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and [[space]] coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; does not affect the [[lightlike]] geodesics apart from their parametrization.

Fermat's principle for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold states that the light ray path between points &lt;math&gt;x_a=(x^1_a,x^2_a,x^3_a) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_b=(x^1_b,x^2_b,x^3_b) &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to zero variation of [[Action (physics)|action]]

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}\left(\sqrt{\hat{g}_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\mu} \frac{dx^{\beta}}{d\mu}}+\phi_{\alpha}(x)\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\mu} \right) d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is any parameter ranging over an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[\mu_a, \mu_b] &lt;/math&gt;  and varying along [[curve]] with fixed endpoints &lt;math&gt;x_a=x(\mu_a) &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;x_b=x(\mu_b)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Principle of stationary integral of energy ==

In principle of stationary integral of energy for a light-like particle's motion, the pseudo-Riemannian metric with coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a transformation

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{g}_{00} =\rho ^{2}{g}_{00} ,\,\,\,\, \tilde{g}_{0k}=\rho{g}_{0k} ,\,\,\,\, \tilde{g}_{kq} ={g}_{kq} .&lt;/math&gt;

With time coordinate &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; and space coordinates with indexes ''k,q=1,2,3'' the [[line element]] is written in form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2=\rho^2 g_{00}(dx^{0})^{2}+ 2\rho g_{0k}dx^{0}dx^{k}+g_{kq}dx^{k}dx^{q},&lt;/math&gt;
       
where &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;  is some quantity, which is assumed equal 1 and regarded as the energy of the light-like particle with &lt;math&gt;ds=0&lt;/math&gt;. Solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; under condition &lt;math&gt;g_{00} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;  gives two solutions

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =\frac{-g_{0k} v^{k} \pm \sqrt{(g_{0k} g_{0q} -g_{00} g_{kq})v^{k} v^{q} } }{g_{00} v^{0} },&lt;/math&gt;
           
where &lt;math&gt;v^{i}=dx^i/d\mu&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the [[four-velocity]]. Even if one solution, in accordance with making definitions, is &lt;math&gt;\rho=1 &lt;/math&gt;.

With &lt;math&gt;g_{00}=0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g_{0k} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; even if for one ''k'' the energy takes form

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =-\frac{g_{kq} v^{k} v^{q} }{2v_{0} v^{0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases for the [[Free motion equation|free moving]] particle the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is

:&lt;math&gt;L= -\rho.&lt;/math&gt;
                                                                       
Its [[partial derivatives]] give the [[Momentum|canonical momenta]]

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\lambda}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^{\lambda}}=\frac{v_{\lambda}}{v^{0}v_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;
                                                      
and the [[forces]]

: &lt;math&gt;F_{\lambda}=\frac{\partial L }{\partial x^{\lambda}}=\frac{1}{2v^{0}v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}v^{i}v^{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Momenta satisfy energy condition &lt;ref name = "Land2"&gt;{{Citation|author=Landau, Lev D.|authorlink=Lev Landau|author2= Lifshitz, Evgeny F.| author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz|title= Mechanics Vol. 1 (3rd ed.)|location=London|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=1976|isbn=9780750628969| page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for [[closed system]]  
             
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=v^{\lambda}p_{\lambda}-L,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

Standard [[variational method|variational procedure]] according to [[Hamilton's principle]] is applied to action

:&lt;math&gt; S=\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}L d\mu=-\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}\rho d\mu, &lt;/math&gt;
 
which is integral of energy. Stationary action is conditional upon zero variational derivatives {{math|''δS''/''δx''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt; }}
and leads to [[Euler–Lagrange equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu}\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial v^{\lambda}}-\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial x^{\lambda}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is rewritten in form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu} p_{\lambda}-F_{\lambda}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

After substitution of canonical momentum and forces they give motion equations of lightlike particle in a [[free space]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv^{0}}{d\mu}+\frac{v^{0}}{2v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{0}}v^{i}v^{j}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; (g_{k\lambda} v_{0}-g_{0k}v_{\lambda})\frac{dv^{k}}{d\mu}+\left[\frac{1}{2v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{0}}(g_{00}v^{0}v_{\lambda}+ g_{k\lambda}v^{k}v_{0})-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}v_{0} +\frac{\partial g_{i\lambda}}{\partial x^{j}}v_0- \frac{\partial g_{0i}}{\partial x^{j}}v_{\lambda}\right]v^i v^j=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Static spacetime ==
For the [[Isotropic_line|isotropic paths]] a transformation to metric &lt;math&gt; \overline{g}_{ij}=g_{ij}/{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to replacement of parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;  on &lt;math&gt;d\overline{\mu}=d\mu/\sqrt{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt; to which the four-velocities &lt;math&gt;\overline{v}^{i}=dx^i/d\overline{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; correspond. The curve of motion of lightlike particle in [[four-dimensional space]]time and value of energy &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;  are [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] under this reparametrization. 
For the [[static spacetime]] the first equation of motion with appropriate parameter &lt;math&gt;\overline \mu&lt;/math&gt;  gives &lt;math&gt;\overline v^0=1&lt;/math&gt; . Canonical momentum and forces take form

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{p}_{\lambda}=\overline v_{\lambda}; \qquad \overline{F}_{\lambda}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \overline{g}_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\overline{v}^{i}\overline{v}^{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of them in Euler–Lagrange equations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu}\left(\overline{g}_{\lambda k} \overline{v}^k\right)=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \overline{g}_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\overline{v}^{i}\overline{v}^{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

After differentiation on the left side and multiplying by &lt;math&gt;\overline{g}^{l \lambda}&lt;/math&gt; this expression, after the summation over the repeated index &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, becomes null geodesic equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x^l}{d\overline{\mu}^2}+\Gamma^l_{ij} \frac{dx^i}{d\overline{\mu}}\frac{dx^j}{d\overline{\mu}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the second kind [[Christoffel symbols]] with respect to the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt; \overline{g}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

So in case of the static spacetime the geodesic principle and the energy variational method as well as Fermat's principle give the same solution for the light propagation.

'''General Chinese''' ({{zh|通字}} ''Tung-dzih'') is a [[diaphonemic]] orthography invented by [[Chao Yuen Ren|Yuen Ren Chao]] to represent the pronunciations of all major varieties of Chinese simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Chao (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the most complete genuine Chinese diasystem yet published".&lt;ref&gt;Branner 2006:231.  More recent diaphonemic systems, such as Ao (1991) and Norman (2006), cover a smaller number of morphemes. Norman also excludes Min, though he covers a larger number of non-Min dialects than Chao.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for the [[Hanja|Korean]], [[on'yomi|Japanese]], and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Vietnamese]] [[Sinoxenic|pronunciations of Chinese characters]], and challenges the claim that [[Chinese character]]s are required for interdialectal communication in written Chinese.

General Chinese is not specifically a romanization system, but two alternative systems: one (''Tung-dzih Xonn-dzih'') uses Chinese characters phonetically, as a [[syllabary]] of 2082 glyphs, and the other (''Tung-dzih Lo-maa-dzih'') is an alphabetic romanization system with similar sound values and tone spellings to [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]].

==Character-based General Chinese==

The character version of General Chinese uses distinct characters for any traditional characters that are distinguished [[phoneme|phonemically]] in any of the control varieties of Chinese, which consist of several dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Cantonese language|Yue]]. That is, a single syllabic character will only correspond to more than one logographic character when these are [[homonym]]s in all control dialects. In effect, General Chinese is a syllabic reconstruction of the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]], less distinctions which have been dropped nearly everywhere.

The result is a syllabary of 2082 syllables, about 80% of which are single morphemes—that is, in 80% of cases there is no difference between GC and standard written Chinese, and in running text, that figure rises to 90–95%, as the most common morphemes tend to be uniquely identified. For example, ''kai'' can only mean 開 ''kāi'' 'open', and ''sam'' can only mean 三 ''sān'' 'three'.&lt;ref&gt;Excepting rare, obsolete, or variant characters, such as 叁, the bank variant of ''sān'' 'three'.&lt;/ref&gt; Chao notes, "These syllables then are morphemes, or words with definite meanings, or clusters of meanings related by extensions. About 20 percent of the syllables are homophones under each of which there will be more than one morpheme, [which are traditionally] usually written with different characters [...] The degree of homophony is so low that it will be possible to write text either in literary or colloquial Chinese with the same character for each syllable [...] as has been tested in texts of various styles." Chao compares General Chinese to how Chinese was written when the writing system was still productive: "This amounts to a 100 percent use of writing Chinese by '[[Phonetic loan character|phonetic loan]]' [...] The situation is that when the ancients wrote a character by sound regardless of meaning, it was a 'loan character', whereas if a modern schoolboy writes one, he is punished for writing the wrong character!"&lt;ref&gt;Chao 1976:107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a telegraphic code-book of about 10,000 characters as a representative list of characters in modern use,&lt;ref&gt;Since, as he put it, "most of the additional [characters in a large dictionary] are simply graphical variants or quite obsolete words" (Chao 1976:115).&lt;/ref&gt; Chao notes that General Chinese results in a reduction of 80% in the number of characters needing to be learned.

In the 20% of cases where a syllable corresponded to more than one word, Chao generally selected the graphically most basic traditional character for General Chinese, as long as it wasn't unduly rare. However, when that character had strong semantic connotations that would have interfered with a phonetic reading, he selected a more neutral character. This phenomenon is familiar from [[Transcription into Chinese characters|Chinese transcriptions of foreign names]].

==Romanized General Chinese==

Romanized General Chinese has distinct symbols for the [[Rime table#Initials|onsets]] (many of them [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], and a few trigraphs) and the [[Rime table#Finals|rimes]] distinguished by any of the control dialects. For example, it retains the final consonants ''p, t, k'', and the distinction between final ''m'' and ''n'', as these are found in several modern dialects, such as Cantonese. General Chinese also maintains the "round-sharp" distinction, such as ''sia'' vs. ''hia'', though those are both ''xia'' in Beijing Mandarin. It also indicates the "muddy" (voiced) [[stop consonant|stops]] of [[Shanghainese]]. Indeed, Chao characterized GC as having "the initial consonants of the Wu dialects [...], the vowels of Mandarin, and the endings of Cantonese. It can, however, be pronounced in any dialect, and it is meant to be, by a relatively short list of rules of pronunciation."&lt;ref&gt;Chao 1976:106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chao's other invention, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, romanized General Chinese uses tone spelling. However, the system is somewhat different. The difference between the [[four tones|''yin'' and ''yang'' tones]] is indicated by the [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of the initial [[consonant]], which is possible because the original voicing distinctions are retained. Given that some tones are indicated by changing rather than adding letters, writing tone requires on average only one additional letter for every three syllables of text.

The digraphs are not reliably [[distinctive feature|featural]]; for example, the digraphs for the voiced stops do not all follow the same pattern. This is because Chao ran frequency tests, and used single letters for the most common consonants and [[vowels]], while restricting digraphs and [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraphs]] to the more infrequent ones. Overall, syllables in the texts he transliterated averaged under 3½ letters apiece.

An example of Romanized General Chinese can be illustrated with Chao's name:

All the General Chinese initials here are voiced: The ''h'' in ''dh'' shows that this is a "muddy" consonant, and the ''q'' in ''qiuan'' represents an initial ''ng-'' (becoming ''g'' in Japanese). This voicing shows up in the Cantonese ''yang'' tones, which are represented by aitches in Yale romanization. "Heavy" codas, such as ''remm'', indicate the "departing" (去) tone, as in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Similarly, the spelling ''ao'' in ''dhyao'' indicates the "rising" (上) tone, but because of the voiced initial, it merges with "departing" in Mandarin and literary Cantonese (though not in colloquial Cantonese). The ''y'' in ''dhyao'' indicates that the initial is a stop in Min, Japanese, and Vietnamese, but otherwise an affricate. Cantonese and Korean retain the final ''m'' of ''remm''. These pronunciations are all predictable given the General Chinese transcription, though it was not designed with the Sinospheric languages specifically in mind. Both the pre-war and post-war Japanese orthographies are recoverable.

In every control dialect, some syllables with different spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety will have a pronunciation for a syllable that is not what one would expect from other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.

===Utility of romanized General Chinese vs. traditional characters===

A common argument for retaining Chinese characters is that romanization systems are insufficient to unambiguously represent the Chinese language, due to the large number of homonyms. (However, the Chinese military has found pinyin to be sufficient to telegraph military communications, even without indicating tone.){{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Because General Chinese makes many distinctions that Pinyin does not, it has many fewer homonyms to confuse the reader. Combine this with the fact that many traditional Chinese characters are restricted to specific compounds, and that many homonymic characters distinguish meanings of what are historically the same word, and which are therefore understandable in context, Chao believed that General Chinese begins to approach the effectiveness of traditional characters in representing Chinese.

==Onsets and rhymes==
Character GC has a separate character for each syllable. However, romanized GC has distinct onsets and rhymes. The onsets are as follows:

泥 and 娘 are both transcribed {{angbr|n}}, as these are not distinct in modern dialects. 喻, a conflation of two older initials, 云 ''hy~hw'' and 以 ''y~w'', is transcribed {{angbr|h}} or ∅ according to modern rather than ancient forms; when palatalization is lost, it is transcribed {{angbr|w}}. The palatal and retroflex fricatives 照穿牀審禪 fell together early on in the rime tables of Classical Chinese, but are still distinguished in some modern dialects, and so are distinguished here. The convention {{angbr|q}} for nasal 疑, which drops in many dialects, is repeated in the finals, where it represents {{IPA|*[ŋ]}} with a departing tone.

Although to some extent systematic—the retroflex series are digraphs ending in {{angbr|r}}, for example—this is overridden in many cases by the principle of using short transcriptions for common sounds. Thus {{angbr|z}} is used for 精 rather than for the less common 邪, where it might also be expected; {{angbr|v}} is used for frequent 微 rather than for 奉; and {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|g}}, for the high-frequency 見 and 羣, have the additional benefit of being familiar in their palatalized forms (Peking ~ Beijing for example is -{{angbr|cieng}}) from English words like ''cello'' and ''gem.''

====Dialectal correspondences====
The voiced obstruents (the 濁 "muddy" column) are only distinct in Wu dialects. In Min, they are collapsed with the consonants of the tenuis column. Elsewhere they are generally collapsed with the aspirated column in the even tone, and with the tenuis column in other tones. An exception is Cantonese, where in the rising tone they are aspirated in colloquial speech, but tenuis in reading pronunciations. The sonorants do not vary much apart from {{angbr|v}}, {{angbr|r}}, which in Wu are nasals {{IPA|[m], [ɲ]}} colloquially but fricatives {{IPA|[v], [z]}} when read.

Velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}} are palatalized to affricates before {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|iu}} (the high-front vowels {{IPA|[i], [y]}}) apart from Min and Yue, where they remain stops before all vowels; {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|h}} also palatalize, but remain fricatives. For instance in Mandarin, they are ''g, k, h'' before non-palatalizing vowels and ''j, q, x'' before palatalizing vowels, whereas in Cantonese they remain ''g, k, h'' everywhere. (Compare the alternate spellings of ''Beijing'' and ''Peking''.) The alveolar sibilants {{angbr|z}}, {{angbr|ts}}, {{angbr|dz}}, {{angbr|s}}, {{angbr|sz}} (Mandarin ''z, c, s'') are also generally palatalized before {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|iu}} (to Mandarin ''j, q, x''), collapsing with the palatalized velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|h}} in dialects which have lost the "round-sharp" distinction so important to Peking opera.

The palatal stops {{angbr|dy}}, {{angbr|ty}}, {{angbr|dhy}} remain stops only in Min among the Chinese lects (though also in Japanese and Vietnamese loan words); elsewhere they are conflated with the affricates. The palatal and retroflex sibilants are generally conflated; in Yue and Min, as well as in much of Wu and Mandarin, they are further conflated with the alveolar sibilants. This contrast remains in Beijing, where {{IPA|[sán]}} 'three' is distinct from {{IPA|[ʂán]}} 'mountain'; both are {{IPA|[sán]}} in Sichuanese and Taiwanese Mandarin.

There are numerous more sporadic correlations. For instance, the alveolar affricates {{angbr|z}}, {{angbr|ts}}, {{angbr|dz}} become stops {{IPA|[t], [tʰ]}} in Taishan Yue, whereas the alveolar stops are [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{IPA|[ʔ], [h]}}, as in ''Hoisaan'' for Cantonese ''Toisaan'' (Taishan). In [[Yüchi, Yunnan]], it is the velars {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|g}} which are debuccalized, to {{IPA|[ʔ], [ʔʰ]}}. In the Min dialects, {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|fv}} become {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ʍ]}}. In Xi'an Mandarin, the fricatives {{angbr|sh}}, {{angbr|sr}}, {{angbr|zh}}, {{angbr|zr}} are rounded to {{IPA|[f]}} before [[rounded vowel]]s, as in {{IPA|[fêi]}} 'water' (Beijing ''shuǐ'' {{IPA|[ʂwèi]}}).

===Medials===

The categories of the Late Middle Chinese [[rime table]]s are reduced to the four medials of modern Chinese, plus an intermediate type {{angbr|e}}:
{| class=wikitable 
! rowspan="2" |
! rowspan="2" | Division I!!colspan="2" | Division II!!rowspan="2" | Divisions III and IV
|-
! others!! back initials

|- align="center"
! Closed (合)
| colspan="3" | {{tooltip|合|hé}} {{angbr|'''u'''}} || {{tooltip|撮|cuō}} {{angbr|'''iu'''}}
|}
⟨i⟩ and ⟨iu⟩ are omitted after labiodental initials.

====Dialectal correspondences====
The medial {{angbr|e}} is used for syllables which have a palatalizing medial {{IPA|[i]}} in Mandarin, but no medial in Yue. That is, in Mandarin {{angbr|e}} should be read as {{angbr|i}}, with the same effect on consonants as {{angbr|i}} has, whereas in Cantonese it is silent. In Shanghainese both situations occur: {{angbr|e}} is equivalent to {{angbr|i}} in reading pronunciations, as {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[y]}}, but is not found in colloquial speech.

In Cantonese, medial {{angbr|i}} can be ignored after sibilants, as palatalization has been lost in these series. That is, ''siao, shao'' are read the same.

===Rimes===
Chao uses the following rimes. They do not always correspond to the [[Middle Chinese#Finals|Middle Chinese rimes]].

Rimes consist of a nucleus (the main vowel) and optionally a coda. They need to be considered as a unit because of a strong historical interaction between vowel and coda in Chinese dialects. The following combinations occur (note that the vowel {{angbr|iu}} is treated as medial {{angbr|i}} plus nucleus {{angbr|u}}):

{| class=wikitable
! rowspan=2 colspan=2| !!colspan=5|coda
|-

|-
|eng
|-
!i
| || ||im||in||ing
|-
!u
| || || ||un||ung
|}

====Dialectal correspondences====
The most salient dialectal difference in rimes is perhaps the lack of the obstruent codas {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|t}}, {{angbr|c}} in most dialects of Mandarin and independently in the [[Wencheng dialect]] of [[Oujiang Chinese|Oujiang]], though this has traditionally been seen as a loss of ''tone'' (see below). In Wu, Min (generally), New Xiang (Hunanese), Jin, and in the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] and [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]] dialects of Mandarin, these codas conflate to [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. In others, such as Gan, they are reduced to {{IPA|[t], [k]}}, while Yue dialects, Hakka, and Old Xiang maintain the original {{IPA|[p], [t], [k]}} system.

Nasal codas are also reduced in many dialects. Mandarin and Wu do not distinguish between {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}, with them being reduced to {{IPA|[n]}} or nasal vowels, or in some cases dropped altogether. In Shanghainese many instances of {{angbr|nɡ}} have conflated as well, or been dropped, but a phonemic distinction is maintained.

In Mandarin, an additional coda is found, ''-er'' {{IPA|[ɻ]}}, from GC {{angbr|ri}}.&lt;ref&gt;The "[[erhua]]" reported from northern Wu dialects such as [[Hangzhou dialect|Hangzhou]] actually involves suffixing a nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, not {{IPA|[ɻ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cantonese, the simple vowels ''i u iu o a e'' are {{IPA|[iː uː yː ɔː aː ɛː]}}, apart from {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|iu}} after velars, which open to diphthongs, as in ''ci'' {{IPA|[kei]}} and ''ciu'' {{IPA|[kɵy]}}. Diphthongs may vary markedly depending on initial and medial, as in ''cau'' {{IPA|[kou]}}, ''ceau'' {{IPA|[kaːu]}}, ''ciau'' {{IPA|[kiːu]}}, though both ''ceu ~ cieu'' are {{IPA|[kɐu]}}, following the general pattern of {{angbr|e}} before a coda (cf. ''cen'' {{IPA|[kɐn]}} vs ''can'' {{IPA|[kaːn]}}). Cantonese does not have medials, apart from ''gw, kw'', though sometimes it is the nuclear vowel which drops: ''giung'' {{IPA|[kʰoŋ]}}, ''xiong'' {{IPA|[hoŋ]}}, but ''giuan'' {{IPA|[kʰyːn]}}.

=== Combinations of medials and rimes ===

The following combinations of orthographic medials and rimes occur, taking ''-iu'' to be medial ''i'' + rime ''u'' :

{| class=wikitable 
! !!o!!a!!e!!ai!!ei!!i!!u!!au!!eu!!om!!am!!em!!im!!on!!an!!en!!un!!in!!ang*!!aeng!!eng!!ing!!ung!!ong*
|-align=center

|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; In entering tone, ''ang (eang, iang, uang)'' changes to ''oc (eoc, ioc, uoc)'', and ''ong (iong)'' changes to ''ouc (iouc)''
:&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; ''-eaeng'' is generally shortened to ''-aeng''
:&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; In entering tone, ''iuan'' changes to ''iuet''
Double cells show discrepancies between analysis and orthography. For instance, Chao analyzes ''ieng, iueng'' as part of the ''aeng'' series rather than the ''eng'' series, and ''ien'' as part of the ''an'' series.&lt;ref&gt;This corresponds to pinyin, which has ''ian'' for Chao's ''ien'', for example in 天 ''tien'' &amp;rarr; ''tiān''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not apparent from the chart, ''eng-ing-ueng-iuing'', ''ung-ong-iung-iong'', and ''en-in-un-iun'' are similar series. The discrepancies are due to an effort to keep frequent syllables short: ''en-in-un-iun'' rather than ''*en-ien-uen-iuen'', for example; as well as a reflection of some of the more widespread phonological changes in the rimes.

The Classical correspondences, with many archaic distinctions lost, are as follows:

|}
These all occur in the velar-initial series, but not all in the others.

====Dialectal correspondences====

In Cantonese, after coronal stops and sibilants, rounded finals such as ''-on'' and ''-uan'' produce front rounded vowels, as in ''don'' {{IPA|[tyːn]}}, and after velars, ''iung'' and ''iong'' lose their {{angbr|i}}. 
Min dialects are similar, but in certain tones {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|iu}} become diphthongs rather that their usual {{IPA|[i], [y]}}. For example, in Fuzhou, even-tone 星 ''sieng'' is {{IPA|[siŋ]}} but going-tone 性 ''sieq'' is {{IPA|[seiŋ]}}.

In Yunnan Mandarin, {{angbr|iu}} is pronounced as {{angbr|i}}, so that the name of the province, ''yunnom'', is {{IPA|[inna]}} rather than {{IPA|[ynnan]}} as in Beijing.

In Nanking, {{angbr|ien}} [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesizes]] to {{IPA|[ein]}} after alveolars, as in 天 {{IPA|[tʰein]}} for Beijing ''tian'' {{IPA|[tʰiɛn]}}.

===Tones===
The basic spelling is used for the even 平 tone(s). For the rising 上 tone(s), the nucleus is doubled (with the vowel {{angbr|iu}} → {{angbr|iuu}}, as that is treated as medial {{angbr|i}} + nucleus {{angbr|u}}), or the coda is changed to a 'lighter' letter. For the going 去 tone(s), the coda is made 'heavier'; if there is no coda, add {{angbr|h}}. For the entering 入 tone(s), a stop coda is used.

'Lighter' means that a vowel coda is made more [[relative articulation#Lowered|open]] ({{angbr|i}} → {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|u}} → {{angbr|o}}); 'heavier' means that a vowel coda is made more [[relative articulation#Raised|close]] ({{angbr|i}} → {{angbr|y}}, {{angbr|u}} → {{angbr|w}}) and a nasal coda ({{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|m}}) is doubled. The nasal {{angbr|ng}} is 'lightened' to {{angbr|g}} (as in many Polynesian languages) and made heavier as {{angbr|q}} (as in the GC initial):

{| class=wikitable

|}

One consequence of this is that the rimes ''-e'' and ''-ei'' in the even tone conflate to {{angbr|ee}} in the rising tone. However, since there are no such syllables which begin with the same consonant and medial, no syllables are actually conflated.

The difference between ''yin'' and ''yang'' tones is indicated by the voicing of the consonant. A zero consonant is treated as voiceless (it is sometimes reconstructed as a [[glottal stop]]), so ''i, iem, uon, iuan'' are ''ping yin'' (Mandarin ''yī, yān, wān, yuān''), whereas ''yi, yem, won, yuan'' are ''ping yang'' (Mandarin ''yí, yán, wán, yuán''). In a few cases, the effect that voiced {{angbr|m}}, {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|r}} have on tone needs to be negated to achieve a ''ping yin'' tone. This is accomplished by spelling them {{angbr|mh}}, {{angbr|nh}}, {{angbr|lh}}, {{angbr|rh}}.

To mark the toneless Mandarin syllable ''ma'', a centered dot is used: {{angbr|·ma}}. The dot is omitted for toneless {{angbr|me, de, te, ne, le}}, as tonic ''me, de, te, ne, le'' do not exist.

====Dialectal correspondences====
The realization of the tones in the various varieties of Chinese is generally predictable; see [[Four tones]] for details. In Beijing Mandarin, for example, even tone is split according to voicing, with muddy consonants becoming aspirates: ''ba, pa, ma, bha'' → ''bā, pā, má, pá'' (and ''mha'' → ''mā''). Going tone is not split, and muddy consonants become tenuis: ''bah, pah, mah, bhah'' → ''bà, pà, mà, bà.'' Rising tone splits, not along voicing, but with muddy-consonant syllables conflating with going tone: ''baa, paa, maa, bhaa'' → ''bǎ, pǎ, mǎ, bà''. That is, ''bhaa'' and ''bhah'' are homonyms in Beijing, as indeed they are in all of Mandarin, in Wu apart from [[Wenzhounese]], in Hakka, and in reading pronunciations of Cantonese. Entering tone is likewise split in Beijing: ''mat, bhat'' → ''mà, bá''.&lt;ref&gt;These series are for illustration; not all of the syllables actually exist.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the realization of entering tones in Beijing dialect, and thus in Standard Chinese, is not predictable when a syllable has a voiceless initial such as ''bat'' or ''pat''. In such cases even syllables with the same GC spelling may have different tones in Beijing, though they remain homonyms in other Mandarin dialects, such as Xian and Sichuanese.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Tianjin dialect]], for example, ''bat, pat, mat, bhat'' &amp;rarr; ''bā, pā, mà, bá''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to historical dialect-mixing in the Chinese capital that resulted in unavoidably idiosyncratic correspondences.

In Yue, there is a straightforward split according to consonant voicing, with a postvocalic {{angbr|h}} in Yale romanization for the latter. Muddy onsets become aspirates in even and rising tones, but tenuis in going and entering tones: ''ba, pa, ma, bha'' → ''bā, pā, māh, pāh''; ''baa, paa, maa, bhaa'' → ''bá, pá, máh, páh''; ''bah, pah, mah, bhah'' → ''ba, pa, mah, bah''; ''bat, pat, mat, bhat'' → ''baat, paat, maht, baht''. In addition, there is a split in entering tone according to vowel length, with Cantonese mid-entering tone for short vowels like ''bāt, pāt''.&lt;ref&gt;This only affects syllables with voiceless initials in Cantonese, but affects all entering-tone syllables in [[Bobai dialect|Bobai]].&lt;/ref&gt; In reading pronunciations, however, rising tone syllables with muddy onsets are treated as going tone: ''bhaa'' → ''bah'' rather than → ''páh''. There is also an unpredictable split in the even ''ping yin'' tone which indicates diminutives or a change in part of speech, but this is not written in all Cantonese romanizations (it is written in Yale, but not in Jyutping).

==Sample text==
Chao provided this poem as an example. The character text is no different in GC and standard Chinese, apart from 裏 ''lǐ'', which in any case has now been substituted with Chao's choice of 里 on the Mainland. Note that simplified characters like this would affect all of Chao's proposal, so that 對 below would become 对, etc. The only other difference is 他 ''tā'' for 'her', which may differ from [[written vernacular Chinese|contemporary written Chinese]] 她, but which follows Classical usage.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liu Bannong]], who invented the character 她.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California golden trout''', or simply the '''golden trout ''' (''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita''), is a [[subspecies]] of the [[rainbow trout]] native to [[California]]. The golden trout is native to Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the [[Kern River]]), Volcano Creek (tributary to Golden Trout Creek), and the [[South Fork Kern River]]. It is the state fish of California.

The California golden trout is closely related to two other [[rainbow trout]] subspecies. The [[Little Kern golden trout]] (''O. m. whitei''), found in the [[Little Kern River]] basin, and the [[Kern River rainbow trout]] (''O. m. gilberti''), found in the [[Kern River]] system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the "golden trout complex".&lt;ref&gt;Inland Fishes of California, By Peter B. Moyle. Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wind River 08 042.jpg|Right|thumb|Golden trout caught in a high mountain lake of the [[Wind River Range]].]]

==Taxonomy==
Originally the golden trout was described as a subspecies of the salmon species, with a name ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita'',&lt;ref name=cof/&gt; and it is still often considered a subspecies (now called ''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita'') along with several other rainbow trout subspecies commonly known as [[redband trout]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[FishBase]] and the [[Catalog of Fishes]] however now (2014) list ''O. aguabonita'' as an independent species rather than as subspecies of ''O. mykiss''.&lt;ref name=cof&gt;W. Eschmeyer (2014) [http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatget.asp?spid=10603 aguabonita, Salmo mykiss] Catalog of Fishes. California Academy of Sciences. (accessed 3 Nov 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase|Oncorhynchus|aguabonita|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, while [[ITIS]] lists ''O. m. whitei''  and ''O. m. gilberti'' as subspecies of ''O. mykiss'',&lt;ref name=itis&gt;{{ ITIS | id=161989 | taxon=Oncorhynchus mykiss | accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''O. aguabonita'' instead is listed as a full species.&lt;ref name=itis-mykiss-aguabonita/&gt;&lt;ref name=itis-aguabonita&gt;{{ ITIS | id=161987 | taxon=Oncorhynchus aguabonita | accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The golden trout has golden flanks with red, horizontal bands along the lateral lines on each side and about 10 dark, vertical, oval marks (called "parr marks") on each side.  Dorsal, lateral and anal fins have white leading edges. In their native habitat, adults range from {{convert|6|to|12|in|cm}} long. Fish over {{convert|12|in|cm}} are considered large. Golden trout that have been transplanted to lakes have been recorded up to {{convert|11|lbs|kg}}.

The golden trout should be distinguished from the similarly named [[Rainbow trout|golden rainbow trout]], also known as the palomino trout. The golden rainbow is a color variant of the rainbow trout.&lt;ref&gt;S. Dobosz, K. Kohlmann, K. Goryczko, H. Kuzminski. "Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout". ''[[Journal of Applied Ichthyology]]'', Volume 16, Issue 3 pp. 117–120, June 2000 {{doi|10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00147.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden trout is commonly found at elevations from {{convert|6890|ft|m}} to {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], and is native only to [[California]]'s southern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. Outside of its native range in California, Golden trout are more often found in cirques and creeks in wilderness areas around 10,500–12,000"+, often beyond 12,500"+ passes that are not passable without crampons, ice axes, and ropes until after the Fourth of July.&lt;ref name=Plan/&gt; Their preferred water temperature is {{convert|58|to|62|F|C}} but they can tolerate temperatures in degraded streams on the Kern Plateau as high as {{convert|70|F|C}} so long as those waters cool during the night.&lt;ref name=Plan/&gt; The only other species of fish indigenous to the native range of California golden trout is the [[Sacramento sucker]] (''Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis'').&lt;ref name=Pister/&gt;

=== Record catches ===

The Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Department state record golden trout measured {{convert|28|in|cm|abbr=on}} and weighed {{convert|11.25|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, caught in Cook Lake, Wyoming in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wyoming's Record Fish | publisher=Wyoming Game and Fish Department | url=http://wgfd.wyo.gov/web2011/FISHING-1000210.aspx | date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IGFA]] "All-Tackle Length Record" for ''O. m. aguabonita'' measured {{convert|53|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=flip}} caught in Golden Lake, Wyoming in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackleLength&amp;cn=Trout,%20golden IGFA World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

''O. m. aguabonita'' is native to the southern Sierra Nevada, including the upper reach and tributaries of the South Fork of the Kern River, and Golden Trout Creek and its tributaries.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; It has been introduced in hundreds of lakes and streams outside the native range, though most of these populations did not last or hybridized with cutthroat trout and other subspecies of rainbow trout.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Distribution data that may be incomplete or inaccurate includes the Canadian province of Alberta, and the US states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt;

==History==
In 1892 the California golden trout was originally described by [[David Starr Jordan]], the first President of [[Stanford University]], as ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita''. The fish was named after the Agua Bonita Waterfall where the first specimens were collected, at the mouth of Volcano Creek, at the creek's confluence with the Kern River.&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal |title=A description of the golden trout of Kern River, California, ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita'' |author=David Starr Jordan |journal=Proceedings of the United States National Museum |volume=xv |issue=916 |date=1892-07-24 |pages=481–483 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/14131 |accessdate=2012-10-16 |doi=10.5479/si.00963801.15-916.481}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later they were listed as ''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita'' in [[Robert J. Behnke|Behnke's]] ''Native trout of western North America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Native trout of western North America. Monograph No. 6 |authorlink=Robert J. Behnke |author=Robert J. Behnke |publisher=American Fisheries Society |year=1992 |isbn=9780913235799 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Stewart Edward White communicated to his friend President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], that overfishing could lead to extinction of the golden trout. In White's novel ''The Mountains'', he wrote about the threatened golden trout on California’s Kern Plateau. Roosevelt shared White’s concern and, through U.S. Fish Commissioner George M. Bowers, dispatched biologist [[Barton Warren Evermann]] of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to study the situation. In 1906 Evermann published ''The Golden Trout of the Southern High Sierras''.&lt;ref name=Evermann&gt;{{cite book |title= The golden trout of the southern high Sierras |authors=Barton Warren Evermann, Oliver Peebles Jenkins, Chancey Juday |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1906 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_golden_trout_of_the_southern_high_Si.html?id=Zds_AAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on morphology, Evermann accurately described four forms of this native fish: ''Salmo roosevelti'' from Golden Trout (Volcano) Creek, ''Salmo aguabonita'' from nearby South Fork of the Kern River, ''Salmo whitei'' (named in recognition of Stewart Edward White) from the Little Kern River, and ''Salmo gilberti'', the Kern River rainbow.&lt;ref name=Pister&gt;{{cite journal |title=California Golden Trout: Perspectives on Restoration and Management |author=Edwin Philip Pister |journal=Fisheries |volume=35 |number=11 |pages=550–553 |doi=10.1577/1548-8446-35.11.550|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies have since clarified three groups of trout native to the Kern River: California golden trout (''O. m. aguabonita'') native to the South Fork Kern River and Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River mainstem but the historic course of the South Fork Kern River and now only separated from it by a lava flow and ridge of sediment), Little Kern River golden trout (''O. m. whitei''), and Kern River rainbow trout (''O. m. gilberti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|title=Systematics, genetics and conservation of golden trout. Ph.D. dissertation. |author=Molly R. Stephens |publisher=University of California Davis |date=2007 |url=http://genome-lab.ucdavis.edu/people/Stephens/Dissertation_Stephens_FINAL_hiqual.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514211638/http://genome-lab.ucdavis.edu/people/Stephens/Dissertation_Stephens_FINAL_hiqual.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Years of [[overfishing|overexploitation]], mismanagement and competition with [[introduced species|exotic species]] have brought golden trout to the brink of being designated as "[[Threatened species|threatened]]".{{citation needed | reason=Designated by whom? Which subspecies? Circumstances of "brink" of designation? | date=December 2013}} Introduced [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') outcompete them for food, introduced [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta'') prey on them and introduced rainbow trout (''O. mykiss'') hybridize with them, damaging the native gene pool through [[introgression]]. Populations have been in steady decline for decades.

In 1978 the [[Golden Trout Wilderness]] was established within [[Inyo National Forest]] and [[Sequoia National Forest]], protecting the upper watersheds of the Kern River and South Fork Kern River.

In September 2004, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] signed an agreement with federal agencies to work on restoring back-country habitat, heavily damaged by overgrazing from cattle and sheep, as part of a comprehensive conservation strategy.&lt;ref name=Plan&gt;{{cite report |title=Conservation Assessment and Strategy for the California Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita) Tulare County, California |authors=Stanley J. Stephens, Christy McGuire, Lisa Sims |publisher=California Department of Fish and Game |date=2004-09-17 |url=http://www.tucalifornia.org/cgtic/GTCAssessmnt&amp;Strategy9-04.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719005821/http://www.tucalifornia.org/cgtic/GTCAssessmnt%26Strategy9-04.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Endangered Species Act|US Endangered Species Act]] (USESA) designated the subspecies ''O. m. whitei'' as LT, or Listed Threatened, since 1978, under the name ''Oncorhynchus aguabonita whitei''.&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei/&gt;

===Subspecies designations===
[[NatureServe]] has designated the following [[NatureServe Conservation Status]] for the three subspecies:

* [[Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita|''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita''—Golden trout]] (G5T1): [[Critically endangered|Critically Imperiled]], last reviewed in 2013.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita&gt;{{cite web | title=Comprehensive Report Species – Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita | url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Oncorhynchus+mykiss+aguabonita | website=NatureServe Explorer | publisher=NatureServe Inc. | accessdate=27 December 2013 | last=Hammerson | first=G | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threat is hybridization and introgression with stocked rainbow trout.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Other threats include competition with non-native brown trout and rainbow trout, predation by brown trout, habitat degradation from cattle grazing, and possibly expanding beaver populations in the native range.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Genetic studies showed hybridization with stocked rainbow trout in almost all known wild populations analyzed to as of 2003.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Non-hybridized populations are restricted to less than 1% of their native range, and confinement to these areas for long periods create a significant risk of inbreeding depression, and loss of heterozygosity and genetic variance.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt;
* [[Kern River rainbow trout|''Oncorhynchus mykiss gilberti''—Kern River rainbow trout]] (G5T1Q): [[Critically endangered|Critically Imperiled]], with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005.&lt;ref name=natureserve-gilberti&gt;{{cite web | title=Comprehensive Report Species – Oncorhynchus mykiss gilberti | url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Oncorhynchus+mykiss+gilberti | website=NatureServe Explorer | publisher=NatureServe Inc. | accessdate=27 December 2013 | last1=Hopkins | first1=T | last2=Moyle | first2=P | last3=Hammerson | first3=G | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few if any genetically pure populations still exist. Primary threats include continued introgression with introduced rainbow trout, habitat loss from grazing, logging and road building, unpredictable events such as floods, drought, and fire (and subsequent landslides), and reduced habitat availability due to introduced beaver.&lt;ref name=natureserve-gilberti/&gt;
* [[Little Kern golden trout|''Oncorhynchus mykiss whitei''—Little Kern golden trout]] (G5T2Q): [[Endangered species|Imperiled]], with questionable taxonomy that may reduce conservation priority, last reviewed in 2005.&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei&gt;{{cite web | title=Comprehensive Report Species – Oncorhynchus mykiss whitei | url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Oncorhynchus+mykiss+whitei | website=NatureServe Explorer | publisher=NatureServe Inc. | accessdate=27 December 2013 | last1=Hopkins | first1=T | last2=Moyle | first2=P | last3=Hammerson | first3=G | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridization with introduced rainbow trout is considered a threat, and "there is a constant threat from introductions of other salmonids by disgruntled anglers."&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei/&gt; The subspecies still occurs in the Little Kern River, above the falls on the lower river, though some populations show signs of introgression with coastal rainbow trout.&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei/&gt;

The American Fisheries Society has designated all three subspecies as [[Threatened species|Threatened]] since August 2008.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt;&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei/&gt;&lt;ref name=natureserve-gilberti/&gt;

==Translocations outside of endemic range==
For sportfishing, the California golden trout underwent many twentieth century translocations into multiple Western states and established populations survive in California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, Colorado, and Wyoming. Populations in the high-elevation lakes in the [[Ruby Mountains]], Nevada, have died out.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web |title=''Oncorhynchus aguabonita'' (Golden Trout) |author=Pam Fuller and Matt Neilson |publisher=USGS Nonindigenous aquatic species (NAS) database |date=2012-03-29 |url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=889 |accessdate=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current status in other states where the California golden trout were planted (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon) lacks documentation.

==Chuck Yeager and the New Mexico population==
When [[Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager]] introduced one of his commanding officers, [[General]] Irving "Twig" Branch, to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] populations of golden trout, Branch ordered Yeager and [[Clarence E. Anderson|Bud Anderson]] to introduce the species to the mountain streams of [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="yeagerbio_348-351"&gt;[[Chuck Yeager|Yeager, Chuck]] and [[Leo Janos|Janos, Leo]]. ''Yeager: An Autobiography''. Pages 348-351 (paperback). New York: Bantam Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0-553-25674-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Mexico populations have also died out.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

In his second autobiography, ''Press On'', Yeager details his annual fishing trips to catch golden trout which he extols as one of the best game fish and best eating fish to be found.

A '''half-truth''' is a [[deception|deceptive statement]] that includes some element of [[truth]]. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may use some deceptive element, such as improper [[punctuation]], or [[double meaning]], especially if the intent is to deceive, [[Evasion (ethics)|evade]], [[blame]] or misrepresent the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Half-truth |title=Merriam Webster Definition of Half-truth, August 1, 2007 |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose and or consequence of a half-truth is to make something that is really only a [[belief]] appear to be [[knowledge]], or a truthful statement to represent the whole truth, or possibly lead to a false conclusion. According to the [[Justified true belief#Justified true belief|justified true belief]] theory of knowledge, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe in the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. A half-truth deceives the recipient by presenting something believable and using those aspects of the statement that can be shown to be true as good reason to believe the statement is true in its entirety, or that the statement represents the whole truth. A person deceived by a half-truth considers the proposition to be knowledge and acts accordingly.

==Examples==
* In January 2018, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] claimed on Twitter that "because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!" Although the unemployment rate for black Americans was indeed at a record low, the rate had been consistently decreasing since 2010, six years before Trump took office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-partly-correct-rejoinder-jay-z/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using a [[technicality]]: Former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] famously engaged in a half-truth when he gave the testimony of "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." Here he engaged in an [[equivocation]] fallacy to deliberately indicate one particular meaning of the phrase "sexual relations", while intending another meaning, in order to deliberately mislead the court while still being able to later claim that "my statements were technically correct."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
*"You should not trust Peter with your children. I once saw him smack a child with his open hand." ''In this example the statement could be true, but Peter may have slapped the child on the back because he was choking.''
*"I'm a really good driver. In the past thirty years, I have gotten only four speeding tickets"* ''This statement is true, but irrelevant if the speaker started driving a week ago.''
*After being stopped for [[drunk driving]], the inebriated driver proclaims "I only had a couple of [[beer]]s" in slurred speech. ''The driver may have also consumed alcoholic drinks other than beer, and the "beers" may have been large bottles as opposed to the usual contents of a normal-sized can, bottle, or glass''
*The classic story about [[blind men and an elephant]]. Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant and reaches a different conclusion about the nature of the elephant; while each man's experience of the elephant is accurate, none of them have a full understanding of the nature of the beast. One may be touching the tail and believe that the elephant is long and thin, another may be touching the belly and say that it is round and big.
*"False dichotomy": the formal fallacy of false dilemma, also known as [[False dilemma|false choice, falsified dilemma]], fallacy of the excluded middle, [[black and white thinking]], false correlative, either/or fallacy, and bifurcation—involves a situation in which two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options, when in reality there exist one or more other options which have not been considered or presented to the listeners.

==Politics==
Some forms of half-truths are an inescapable part of politics in [[representative democracy|representative democracies]]. The reputation of a political candidate can be irreparably damaged if they are exposed in a lie, so a complex style of language has evolved to minimise the chance of this happening. If someone has not said something, they cannot be accused of lying. As a consequence, politics has become a world where half-truths are expected, and political statements are rarely accepted at face value.&lt;ref name="htpolitics"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|author=Crystal, David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] defines a half-truth, for political purposes, as "a statement accurate enough to require an explanation; and the longer the explanation, the more likely a public reaction of half-belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Language of Politics: An Anecdotal Dictionary of Catchwords, Slogans, and Political Usage|author=[[William Safire]]|year=1968|publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 work ''The Magic Lantern: The Revolution of 1989 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, and Prague'', [[Timothy Garton Ash]] responded to [[Václav Havel]]'s call for "living in truth":
{{cquote|Now we expect many things of politicians in a well-functioning parliamentary democracy. But "living in truth" is not one of them. In fact the essence of democratic politics might rather be described as "working in half-truth". Parliamentary democracy is, at its heart, a system of limited adversarial mendacity, in which each party attempts to present part of the truth as if it were the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] was quoted as saying: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, statements, or truths, which according to Whitehead are all half-truths, are susceptible to creating deceptive and false conclusions.

==Meme theory==

[[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] links half-truths to [[meme]]s "the truth of any proposition depends on the assumptions you make in considering it—the distinct memes you use in thinking about it".&lt;ref name="brodie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme|author=Brodie, Richard|year=1996|publisher=Integral Press, Seattle|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie considers half-truths a necessary part of human interaction because they allow practical application of ideas when it is impractical to convey all the information needed to make a fully informed decision, although some half-truths can lead to a false conclusions or [[inferences]] in the world of [[logic]].

==Quotations==
The notion of half-truths has existed in various cultures, giving rise to several [[epigram]]matic sayings.

*[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], an Austrian journalist, critic, playwright, and poet noted, "An [[aphorism]] can never be the whole truth; it is either a half-truth or a truth-and-a-half."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Thomas Szasz]], ''Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry'', 1990, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arthur Koestler]] "Two half-truths do not make a truth, and two half-cultures do not make a culture."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Jonathon Green]], ''Says who?: a guide to the quotations of the century'', 1988, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inclusion ordering.svg|thumb|The [[power set]] of a 2-element set ordered by [[subset|inclusion]] ]]
In [[order theory]], a '''Hasse diagram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhasə|lang}}) is a type of [[mathematical diagram]] used to represent a finite [[partially ordered set]], in the form of a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of its [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, for a partially ordered set ''(S, ≤)'' one represents each element of ''S'' as a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] in the plane and draws a [[line segment]] or curve that goes ''upward'' from ''x'' to ''y'' whenever ''y'' [[Covering relation|covers]] ''x'' (that is, whenever ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' &amp;lt; ''y'').
These curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order.

Hasse diagrams are named after [[Helmut Hasse]] (1898–1979); according to {{harvs|txt|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|year=1948}}, they are so called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse was not the first to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in {{harvs|txt|last=Vogt|first=Henri Gustav|year=1895}}. Although Hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using [[graph drawing]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see {{harvtxt|Di Battista|Tamassia|1988}} and {{harvtxt|Freese|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Hasse diagram" may also refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract [[directed acyclic graph]], independently of any drawing of that graph, but this usage is eschewed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Graph theory: an algorithmic approach|first=Nicos|last=Christofides|publisher=Academic Press|year=1975|pages=170–174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Graphs: Theory and Algorithms|first1=K.|last1=Thulasiraman|first2=M. N. S.|last2=Swamy|publisher=John Wiley and Son|year=1992|isbn=978-0-471-51356-8|contribution=5.7 Acyclic Directed Graphs|page=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Digraphs: Theory, Algorithms and Applications|first1=Jørgen|last1=Bang-Jensen|first2=|last2=|series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84800-997-4|contribution=2.1 Acyclic Digraphs|pages=32–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A "good" Hasse diagram==

Although Hasse diagrams are simple as well as intuitive tools for dealing with finite [[Partially ordered set|posets]], it turns out to be rather difficult to draw "good" diagrams. The reason is that there will in general be many possible ways to draw a Hasse diagram for a given poset. The simple technique of just starting with the [[minimal element]]s of an order and then drawing greater elements incrementally often produces quite poor results: symmetries and internal structure of the order are easily lost.

The following example demonstrates the issue. Consider the [[power set]] of a 4-element set ordered by inclusion &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;. Below are four different Hasse diagrams for this partial order. Each subset has a node labelled with a binary encoding that shows whether a certain element is in the subset (1) or not (0):

{| style="margin: 0 auto;"
| [[File:Hypercubeorder binary.svg|230px|]] ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubecubes binary.svg|260px|]] ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubestar binary.svg|240px|]] ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| [[File:Hypercubematrix binary.svg|180px|]]
|}

The first diagram makes clear that the power set is a [[graded poset]]. The second diagram has the same graded structure, but by making some edges longer than others, it emphasizes that the [[tesseract|4-dimensional cube]] is a union of two 3-dimensional cubes. The third diagram shows some of the internal symmetry of the structure. In the fourth diagram the vertices are arranged like the elements of a 4×4 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

==Upward planarity==
{{main|Upward planar drawing}}
[[File:Dih4 subgroups.svg|thumb|This Hasse diagram of the [[lattice of subgroups]] of the [[dihedral group]] [[Dihedral group of order 8|Dih&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] has no crossing edges.]]
If a partial order can be drawn as a Hasse diagram in which no two edges cross, its covering graph is said to be ''upward planar''. A number of results on upward planarity and on crossing-free Hasse diagram construction are known:
*If the partial order to be drawn is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then it can be drawn without crossings if and only if it has [[order dimension]] at most two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Theorem 9, p. 118; {{harvtxt|Baker|Fishburn|Roberts|1971}}, theorem 4.1, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, a non-crossing drawing may be found by deriving Cartesian coordinates for the elements from their positions in the two linear orders realizing the order dimension, and then rotating the drawing counterclockwise by a 45-degree angle.
*If the partial order has at most one [[minimal element]], or it has at most one [[maximal element]], then it may be tested in [[linear time]] whether it has a non-crossing Hasse diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Theorem 15, p. 125; {{harvtxt|Bertolazzi|Di Battista|Mannino|Tamassia|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is [[NP-complete]] to determine whether a partial order with multiple sources and sinks can be drawn as a crossing-free Hasse diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995a}}, Corollary 1, p. 132; {{harvtxt|Garg|Tamassia|1995b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, finding a crossing-free Hasse diagram is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] when parametrized by the number of [[articulation point]]s and [[triconnected component]]s of the transitive reduction of the partial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the ''y''-coordinates of the elements of a partial order are specified, then a crossing-free Hasse diagram respecting those coordinate assignments can be found in linear time, if such a diagram exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jünger|Leipert|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if the input poset is a [[graded poset]], it is possible to determine in linear time whether there is a crossing-free Hasse diagram in which the height of each vertex is proportional to its rank.

The '''Human Dimension Implementation Meeting''' is a human rights and democracy conference held by the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) on an annual basis in [[Warsaw]] ([[Poland]]).

The two-week conference is attended by some 1000 government representatives, international experts, non-governmental organizations, and human rights activists. Organized every autumn by the Warsaw-based OSCE [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), the meeting is considered to be Europe's largest human rights conference.

The Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM) was established in the early 1990s to create a forum for participating States of the OSCE to discuss the implementation of the "human dimension" commitments they have adopted by consensus at prior Summits and Ministerial Meetings. In OSCE parlance, the term "human dimension" describes the set of norms and activities
related to human rights, the rule of law, and democracy that are regarded within the OSCE
as one of the three pillars of its comprehensive security concept, along with the politico-military
and the economic and environmental dimensions.

One of the distinct features setting the HDIM apart from other high-level human rights conferences is its openness to the participation of [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). NGOs can participate in the conference on an equal footing with government representatives. For NGOs from states where civil society is weak and constrained, the HDIM can be one of the few opportunities they have to make their voices heard before an international audience.

The plenary sessions of the conference are supposed to review the progress made over the past year by participating States and remaining shortcomings with respect to realizing their human dimension commitments.

The agenda is set by the OSCE's Permanent Council. Regular sessions cover the full range of OSCE commitments related to human rights and democracy. Three days are reserved for more in-depth discussions of three different topics selected by the Permanent Council every year.

On the sidelines of the HDIM, dozens of side events are organized by participating delegations and NGOs.

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M.

Digital Technology and Social Change [Open Online Course at the University of California] freely available at: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/949415&lt;/ref&gt; The people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizen]]s, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R. Beniger |date=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press|title-link= The Control Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilbert InfoGrowth.png|thumb|right|360px|The amount of data stored globally has increased greatly since the 1980s, and by 2007, 94% of it was stored digitally. [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html Source]]]

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics'']. Moscow: KomKniga/URSS. P.10-38. {{ISBN|978-5-484-01001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], an '''invariant''' is a property of a system which remains unchanged under some [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]].

==Examples==
{{See also|Lorentz scalar}}
In the current era, the immobility of [[Polaris]] (the North Star) under the [[diurnal motion]] of the [[celestial sphere]] is a classical illustration of physical invariance.

{{Quotation|For example the rule describing Newton's force of gravity between two chunks of matter is the same whether they are in this galaxy or another ([[translational invariance]] in space). It is also the same today as it was a million years ago (translational invariance in time). The law does not work differently depending on whether one chunk is east or north of the other one ([[rotational invariance]]). Nor does the law have to be changed depending on whether you measure the force between the two chunks in a railroad station, or do the same experiment with the two chunks on a uniformly moving train ([[principle of relativity]]).|[[David Mermin]]: ''It's About Time - Understanding Einstein's Relativity'', Chapter 1}}

Another example of a physical invariant is the [[speed of light]] under a [[Lorentz transformation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= French |first= A.P. |title= Special Relativity|year= 1968|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 0-393-09793-5|ref=harvnb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[time]] under a [[Galilean transformation]]. Such spacetime transformations represent shifts between the [[reference frames]] of different observers.

By [[Noether's theorem]] invariance of the action of a physical system under a [[continuous symmetry]] represents a fundamental [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]. For example, invariance under translation leads to [[conservation of momentum]], and invariance in time leads to [[conservation of energy]].

Quantities can be invariant under some common transformations but not under others. For example, the velocity of a particle is invariant when switching from rectangular coordinates to curvilinear coordinates, but is not invariant when transforming between frames of reference that are moving with respect to each other. Other quantities, like the speed of light, are always invariant.

==Importance==
Invariants are important in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]] and invariants. 

[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariance and contravariance]] generalize the mathematical properties of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] in [[tensor|tensor mathematics]], and are frequently used in [[electromagnetism]], [[special relativity]], and [[general relativity]].

A '''late fee''', also known as an ''overdue fine'', ''late fine'', or ''past due fee'', is a charge fined against a client by a company or organization for not paying a bill or returning a rented or borrowed item by its due date. Its use is most commonly associated with businesses like creditors, video rental outlets and [[library|libraries]]. Late fees are generally calculated on a per day, per item basis.

Organizations encourage the payment of late fees by suspending a client's borrowing or rental privileges until accumulated fees are paid, sometimes after these fees have exceeded a certain level.

Late fees are widely regarded as an [[annoyance]]. In 2005, video rental chain [[Blockbuster Video]] capitalized on this perception with a major [[advertising campaign]] that touted a revision of its rental policy as "The End of Late Fees".

More recently, in 2006, [[Rogers Video]] has used the same technique, except only for movies, and without any [[restocking fee]] (due to movies costing much less than video games).

Late fees charged by banks, landlords, and utilities have been heavily criticized as a penalty against the poor, and attempts have been made in some places to outlaw them completely or place caps on them. The argument against them is that the poor will inevitably be forced to pay them as they cannot earn the money to pay their bills by the due date. These people will be forced to pay even higher fees for the same services, and will find making future timely payments to their creditors even more difficult.

Late fees are issued to people who do not pay on time and don't honor a lease or obligation that they are responsible for.

A special use of the term late fee is additional postage that was once required by Post Offices to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing mail dispatch although having been posted later than the normal closing time for mail. Often a special Late Fee Box was provided.

==Assassination==

At about 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 15, 1970, he was killed just outside his Green Duck Tavern by three shotgun blasts. Eyewitnesses reported that the three killers were African-American.

==Murder weapon==

Jordan was killed using a [[Remington Model 870#Variants|Remington 12-gauge Wingmaster shotgun]] which was one of several guns that had been stolen from a hardware store in [[Independence, Missouri]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=gun&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A January, 1966, report on the burglary by the Independence Police Department stated that the guns had later been sold through a "North End Italian fence." This report was not discovered in the initial investigation of Jordan's murder, but was uncovered by investigative journalists working for the ''Kansas City Star'' in 2010. When the reporters asked the Kansas City Police Department about the gun, they were told that it had been lost in 1973. The gun may have been sold in a police surplus auction. Some time later, the police purchased the used shotgun from a gun store, and did not check the serial number. The gun was refurbished and placed into police service.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

On November 5, 1997, a police officer used the shotgun to shoot and wound an armed suspect in [[North Kansas City, Missouri]]. The gun was analyzed by the crime lab, who failed to identify it as the Jordan murder weapon, and it was returned to police service the following year. Only when the ''Kansas City Star'' asked questions about the missing shotgun in 2010 did a crime lab technician run a computer check that located the gun, which was recovered from the trunk of a police car and then returned to the evidence room.&lt;ref name=gun/&gt;

==2010 investigation==

In 2010, reporters with the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' began investigating the assassination while preparing for coverage of the 40th anniversary of Jordan's death. This led to discovery of the missing murder weapon and some old fingerprint cards, and that motivated the Kansas City Police Department to re-open the official investigation of the department's oldest cold case. Civil rights leader [[Alvin Sykes]] pressed the department for a complete investigation.&lt;ref name=gun/&gt; In trying to determine who was responsible for the assassination, the newspaper reported that Jordan and his Freedom, Inc. political movement had been opposed to the "North End" faction in Kansas City politics, a group under the influence of [[La Cosa Nostra]], and which had previously controlled black voting blocs. In 1965, Jordan had punched [[Frank Mazzuca (Missouri)|Frank Mazzuca]], a fellow state legislator who was alleged to have supported mob interests in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], and death threats against Jordan were reported in the aftermath.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

The newspaper reported that police informants associated with the Black Mafia had described the killing as a favor to North End mob interests, and that it was organized by "Shotgun Joe" Centimano, owner of a local liquor store. The informants said that Centimano had supplied the murder weapon and recruited the killers. The newspaper reported that one informant said the assassination had elements of both a "[[contract killing]]" and a "revenge killing", and that another said it was "all about politics."&lt;ref name=killing/&gt; News coverage said that a 900-page police report finished in 2011 had concluded that mob boss [[Nicholas Civella|Nick Civella]] had given his "blessing" to Jordan's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police send report on 1970 slaying to prosecutor | newspaper = [[Columbia Missourian]] | location = [[Columbia, Missouri]] | date = February 9, 2011 | url = http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2011/02/09/police-send-report-1970-slaying-prosecutor/ | accessdate = February 19, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120729210125/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2011/02/09/police-send-report-1970-slaying-prosecutor/ | archivedate = July 29, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No one was indicted because all of the main players were dead by then.

She won the election, and served for 16 years in the Missouri House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt; She died on December 25, 1995 at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=Orchid/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:LeonJordan Memorial (14).jpg|thumb| A statue and park memorializing Jordan was dedicated May 17, 1975. More recently, a plaque commemorating [[Freedom, Inc.]] was placed on the back of the statue's base.]]

THE LEADER

LEON MERCER JORDAN

1905-1970

Leon Mercer Jordan was a leader, a true and gifted servant of his people. He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.A. during an era when he was, solely by reason of his race and color, generally excluded from the society of other so-called civilized folk because of policies and practices of racial segregation, discrimination and exclusion which were firmly embedded in the laws of this land and were clothed with every legal sanction.  Early in life he began to apply his vision, wisdom and iron will to a dissolution of the restraints which were imposed upon him and his people at the time of his birth.  At the time of his death, every legal sanction for racial segregation and discrimination had been eradicated, and he had founded and forged into an instrument of tremendous political force and power an organization called [[Freedom, Inc.]], and through Freedom Inc., Leon Mercer Jordan accomplished the political liberation of black folk in this town and state, he was a Lieutenant of police, Chief of the Constabulary of the Republic of [[Liberia]], a member of the House of Representatives of Missouri, but he is remembered here by this mass of stone and bronze because he was "the Leader" whose work and efforts contributed significantly toward the realization of justice, equality and freedom, for all.}}

His papers, including extensive documentation of his service in Liberia, are collected in the library of the University of Missouri-Kansas City.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

'''William Mark Felt Sr.''' (August 17, 1913&amp;nbsp;– December 18, 2008) was a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) [[special agent]] and [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Associate Director]], the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post, from May 1972 until his retirement from the FBI in June 1973. During his time as Associate Director, Felt served as an anonymous informant, nicknamed '''"[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]"''', to reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He provided them with critical information about the [[Watergate scandal]], which ultimately led to the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. 

Though Felt's identity as Deep Throat was strongly suspected by some in [[Washington, D.C.]], including Nixon himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tapes: Nixon suspected Felt |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/06/02/felt.nixon/index.html |publisher=CNN.com |date= June 3, 2005 |authors=Robert Yoon and Stephen Bach}}&lt;/ref&gt; it generally remained a secret for 30 years. In 2005, Felt finally acknowledged that he was Deep Throat, after being persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity.&lt;ref name="i'm the guy" /&gt;

Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters. In 1980, he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the [[Weather Underground]], by ordering FBI agents to [[black bag operation|break into their homes]] and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings. He was ordered to pay a fine, but was [[Pardon#United States|pardoned]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]] during his appeal.

Felt published two memoirs: ''[[The FBI Pyramid]]'' in 1979 (updated in 2006), and ''A G-Man's Life'', written with John O'Connor, in 2006. In 2012, the FBI released Felt's personnel file, covering the period from 1941 to 1978. It also released files pertaining to an extortion threat made against Felt in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/15/politics/watergate-anniversary-felt/index.html |title=40 years later, remembering Watergate scandal's 'Deep Throat' |publisher=CNN |date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born on August 17, 1913, in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]],&lt;ref name="FeltBirth"/&gt; Felt was the son of Rose R. Dygert and Mark Earl Felt, a carpenter and building contractor.&lt;ref name="FeltContractorDad"/&gt; His paternal grandfather was a [[Free Will Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref name=wasgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/felt.html|title=Ancestry of Mark Felt|website=www.wargs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents were born in [[Canada]] and [[Scotland]]. Through his maternal grandfather, Felt was descended from [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general [[Nicholas Herkimer]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=wasgs/&gt;

After graduating from [[Twin Falls High School]] in 1931, Felt attended the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]].&lt;ref name=gom35sr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1935/45 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Seniors |year=1935 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member and president of the Gamma Gamma chapter of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]].&lt;ref name=gom35btp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1935/267 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Beta Theta Pi |year=1935 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1935.&lt;ref name=gom35sr/&gt;

Felt then went to Washington, D.C., to work in the office of [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[James P. Pope]]. In 1938, Felt married Audrey Robinson of [[Gooding, Idaho]], whom he had known when they were students at the University of Idaho.&lt;ref name=gom37sr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1937/204 |publisher=''Gem of the Mountains,'' University of Idaho yearbook |title=Seniors |year=1937 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had come to Washington to work at the [[Internal Revenue Service|Bureau of Internal Revenue]]. Their wedding was officiated by the chaplain of the [[United States House of Representatives]], the Rev. Sheara Montgomery.&lt;ref name="FeltMarriage" /&gt; Audrey died in 1984; she and Felt had two children, Joan and Mark.

Felt stayed on with Pope's successor in the Senate, [[David Worth Clark]] (D-Idaho).&lt;ref name="SenPopeAndClarke" /&gt; He attended the [[George Washington University Law School]] at night, earning his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] in 1940, and was admitted to the [[District of Columbia Bar]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="TheoharrisGeneralBio" /&gt;

Upon graduation, Felt took a position at the [[Federal Trade Commission]] but did not enjoy his work. His workload was very light, and he was assigned to investigate whether a toilet paper brand, called "Red Cross", was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the [[American Red Cross]]. Felt wrote in his memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, produced two definite conclusions:

1. Most people ''did'' use toilet tissue.

2. Most people ''did not'' appreciate being asked about it.

That was when I started looking for other employment.&lt;ref name="RedCrossToiletPaper" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He applied for a job with the FBI in November 1941 and was accepted. His first day at the Bureau was January 26, 1942.

==Early FBI years==
FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] often moved Bureau agents around so they would have wide experience in the field. This was typical of other agencies and corporations of the time. Felt observed that Hoover "wanted every agent to get into any field office at any time. Since he [Hoover] had never been transferred and did not have a family, he had no idea of the financial and personal hardship involved."&lt;ref name="HooverNoFamily" /&gt;

After completing 16 weeks of training at the [[FBI Academy]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]], and [[FBI Headquarters]] in Washington, Felt was assigned to [[Texas]], spending three months each in the field offices in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. He returned to FBI Headquarters, where he was assigned to the Espionage Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division, tracking down spies and saboteurs during [[World War II]]. He worked on the Major Case Desk. His most notable work was on the "Peasant" case. Helmut Goldschmidt, operating under the codename "Peasant", was a German agent in custody in England. Under Felt's direction, his German masters were informed that "Peasant" had made his way to the United States, and thus were fed [[military deception|disinformation]] on Allied plans.&lt;ref name="Peasant" /&gt;

The Espionage Section was abolished in May 1945 after [[V-E Day]]. After the war, Felt was assigned to the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] field office. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor. Upon passage of the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] and the creation of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], the Seattle office became responsible for completing background checks of workers at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford plutonium plant]] near [[Richland, Washington]]. Felt oversaw those investigations.&lt;ref name="Espionage" /&gt; In 1954, Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector's aide. Two months later, he was sent to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] as Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge of the field office. When he was transferred to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] fifteen months later, he held the same rank there.&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt;

==Investigates organized crime==
In 1956, Felt was transferred to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] and promoted to Special Agent-in-Charge. The Salt Lake City office included [[Nevada]] within its purview, and Felt oversaw some of the Bureau's earliest investigations into [[organized crime]], assessing the mob's operations in the [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s.&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt; (It was Hoover's, and therefore the Bureau's, official position at the time that there was no such thing as the Mob.&lt;ref&gt;''J. Edgar Hoover: The Man And The Secrets'', by [[Curt Gentry]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;) In February 1958, Felt was assigned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]] (which he dubbed "the Siberia of field offices" in his memoir),&lt;ref name="TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"/&gt; where he directed further investigations of organized crime. By this time, Hoover had come to believe in organized crime, in the wake of the famous [[Apalachin, New York]], [[Apalachin Meeting|conclave of underworld bosses]] in November 1957.&lt;ref name="MobKansas" /&gt;

==Middle career==
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[FBI]], photographed in 1961. Hoover appointed Felt the third-ranking official in the Bureau in 1971.]]
Felt returned to Washington, D.C., in September 1962. As assistant to the bureau's assistant director in charge of the Training Division, Felt helped oversee the FBI Academy.&lt;ref name="FeltReturnToDC" /&gt; In November 1964, he was promoted to an Assistant Director of the Bureau, as Chief Inspector of the Bureau and Head of the Inspection Division.&lt;ref name="FeltToInspectionDivision" /&gt; This division oversaw compliance with Bureau regulations and conducted internal investigations.

On July 1, 1971, Felt was promoted by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director [[Clyde Tolson]].&lt;ref name="FeltMadeAsstDirector" /&gt; Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health and unable to carry out his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in [[William C. Sullivan]]'s domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Broken: The Troubled Past and Uncertain Future of the FBI|first=Richard Gid|last=Powers|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2004|ISBN=9780684833712|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, "I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you know he has been getting out of hand."&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirControlSullivan" /&gt; In his book, ''The Bureau'', Ronald Kessler said that Felt "managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents."&lt;ref name="KesslerOnFeltTactfulness" /&gt; [[Curt Gentry]] described Felt as "the director's latest fair-haired boy", who had "no inherent power" in his new post, the real number three being [[John P. Mohr]].&lt;ref name="GentryOnFelt" /&gt;

===Weather Underground investigations===
Among the criminal groups that the FBI investigated in the early 1970s was the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. Their case was dismissed by the court because it concluded that the FBI had conducted illegal activities, including unauthorized [[wiretap]]s, break-ins, and mail interceptions. The lead federal prosecutor on the case, William C. Ibershof, claims that Mark Felt and Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] initiated these illegal activities that tainted the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The New York Times| date=October 9, 2008| author=William C. Ibershof| title=Letter to the Editor: Prosecuting Weathermen| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/opinion/l10ayers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Hoover's death==
[[File:Patrickgrey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[L. Patrick Gray]], acting director of the FBI from May 1972 to April 1973]]
Hoover died in his sleep and was found on the morning of May 2, 1972. Tolson was nominally in charge until the next day, when Nixon appointed [[L. Patrick Gray|L. Patrick Gray III]] as Acting FBI Director. Tolson submitted his resignation, which Gray accepted. Felt succeeded to Tolson's post as Associate Director, the number-two job in the Bureau.&lt;ref name="TolsonResignation" /&gt; Felt served as an honorary pallbearer at Hoover's funeral.&lt;ref name="HooverPallbearer" /&gt;
On the day of Hoover's death, Hoover's secretary for five decades, [[Helen Gandy]], began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the "Official/Confidential" files to Felt on May 4, 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information about individuals whom Hoover had investigated. He used his information as power over them. Felt stored the files in his office.

The existence of such files had long been rumored. Gray told the press that afternoon that "there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity."&lt;ref name="GandyHooversFiles" /&gt; Felt earlier that day had told Gray, "Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray "looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's "Personal File" and destroyed it.&lt;ref name="GandyHooversFiles" /&gt;

When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, "There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't."&lt;ref name="FeltBeforeUSHouseOfRepsOnFileDest" /&gt; At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter were included in the committee's final report.&lt;ref name="FeltBeforeUSHouseOfRepsOnFileDest" /&gt;

In his memoir, Felt expressed mixed feelings about Gray. He was the first person appointed as head of the FBI who had no experience in the agency, but he had experience in the Navy. While noting Gray did work hard, Felt was critical of how often he was away from FBI headquarters. Gray lived in [[Stonington, Connecticut]], and commuted to Washington. He also visited all of the Bureau's field offices except Honolulu. His frequent absences led to the nickname "Three-Day Gray".&lt;ref name="ThreeDayGrayNickname" /&gt; These absences, combined with Gray's hospitalization and recuperation from November 20, 1972, to January 2, 1973,&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; meant that Felt was effectively in charge for much of his final year at the Bureau. Bob Woodward wrote "Gray got to be director of the FBI and Felt did the work."&lt;ref name="WoodwardonGray" /&gt; Felt wrote in his memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The record amply demonstrates that President Nixon made Pat Gray the Acting Director of the FBI because he wanted a politician in J. Edgar Hoover's position who would convert the Bureau into an adjunct of the White House machine.&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirOnGray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gray's defenders would later argue that Gray had practiced a management style that was different from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director; some believed that Gray's visits helped raise the morale of the field agents. Gray's leadership style seemed to continue what he had learned in the [[US Navy]], in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction from the work of the FBI and showed a lack of leadership. He believed that he was not the only career manager at the FBI who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.&lt;ref name="FeltMemoirOnGray" /&gt;

==Watergate==
{{watergate|Intelligence}}{{See also|Watergate scandal}}[[File:Watergate complex.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Felt saw all the FBI's files on its investigation of the break-in there in 1972.]]

As Associate Director, Felt saw everything compiled on [[Watergate]] before it was given to Gray. The Agent in Charge, [[Charles Nuzum]], sent his findings to Investigative Division Head [[Robert Gebhardt (FBI agent)|Robert Gebhardt]], who passed the information on to Felt. From the day of the break-in, June 17, 1972, until the FBI investigation was mostly completed in June 1973, Felt was the key control point for FBI information. He had been among the first to learn of the investigation, being informed the morning of June 17.&lt;ref name="FeltLearnsAboutWatergate" /&gt; [[Ronald Kessler]], who spoke to former Bureau agents, reported that throughout the investigation, they "were amazed to see material in Woodward and Bernstein's stories lifted almost verbatim from their reports of interviews a few days or weeks earlier".&lt;ref name="KesslerAmazed" /&gt;

=== "Deep Throat" informant ===
{{Main|Deep Throat (Watergate)}}

[[Bob Woodward]] first describes his source, nicknamed "Deep Throat", in ''[[All the President's Men]]'', as a "source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP (the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], Nixon's 1972 campaign organization), as well as at the White House."&lt;ref name="BernsteinSourceInExecutive" /&gt; In the book,  Deep Throat is described as an "incurable gossip" who was "in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch", a man "whose fight had been worn out in too many battles".&lt;ref name="BernsteinOnFelt" /&gt; Woodward had known the source before Watergate and had discussed politics and government with him.

In 2005, Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970. Woodward was working as an aide to Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and was delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward described Felt as a "tall man with perfectly combed gray hair&amp;nbsp;... distinguished looking" with a "studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence".&lt;ref name="HowWoodwardMetFelt" /&gt; They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the ''Washington Post'', he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper. Felt's information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal its origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on May 18, 1972, about [[Arthur Bremer]], who shot [[George C. Wallace|George Wallace]].

When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt. The senior manager advised Woodward on June 19 that [[E. Howard Hunt]], who had ties to Nixon, was involved; the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward's source was known at the ''Post'' as "My Friend". ''Post'' editor [[Howard Simons]] tagged him as "Deep Throat", after the widely known porno film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']]. According to Woodward, Simons thought of the term because Felt had been providing information on a [[deep background]] basis.

When Felt revealed his role in 2005, it was noted that "My Friend" has the same initial letters as "Mark Felt". Woodward's notes from interviewing Felt were marked "M.F.", which Woodward says was "not very good tradecraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8486700/ns/dateline_nbc-the_secret_man/t/story-behind-deep-throat/|title=The Story behind 'Deep Throat'|first=Tom|last=Brokaw|date=July 6, 2005|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code for contacting Woodward===
Woodward explained that when he wanted to meet Deep Throat, he would move a flowerpot with a red flag on his apartment balcony; he lived at number 617, Webster House, 1718 P Street, Northwest. On occasions when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' (delivered to his building) and draw clock hands to signal the hour.&lt;ref name="DeepThroatSignal" /&gt; [[Adrian Havill]] questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein. He said Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Woodward said that the courtyard had been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also said ''The Times'' was not delivered in copies marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim.&lt;ref name="HavillOnSignalStory" /&gt;

Woodward said:
{{quote|How [Felt] could have made a daily observation of my balcony is still a mystery to me. At the time, the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.

There were several embassies in the area. The Iraqi embassy was down the street, and I thought it possible that the FBI had surveillance or listening posts nearby. Could Felt have had the counterintelligence agents regularly report on the status of my flag and flowerpot? That seems unlikely, but not impossible.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSurveillanceSpeculation" /&gt;}}

===Haldeman informs Nixon about Felt's leaks===
Days after the break-in, Nixon and [[White House chief of staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] talked about putting pressure on the FBI to slow down the investigation. The District of Columbia police had called in the FBI because they found the burglars had [[wiretapping]] equipment. Wiretapping is a crime investigated by the FBI. Haldeman told President Nixon on June 23, 1972, that Felt would "want to cooperate because he's ambitious."&lt;ref name="HadlemanOnFeltCooperation" /&gt; These tapes were not declassified and revealed for some time.

Haldeman later initially suspected lower-level FBI agents, including [[Angelo Lano]], of speaking to the ''Post''.&lt;ref name="the two lives"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 25, 2007

| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/19/AR2005061900699_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman told the president that sources had said that Felt was speaking to the press.

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can't say anything about this because it will screw up our source and there's a real concern. [[John N. Mitchell|Mitchell]] is the only one who knows about this and he feels strongly that we better not do anything because&amp;nbsp;... if we move on him, he'll go out and unload everything. He knows everything that's to be known in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything.&lt;ref name="HaldemanOnFeltUnloading" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haldeman also said that he had spoken to White House counsel [[John W. Dean]] about punishing Felt, but Dean said Felt had committed no crime and could not be prosecuted.

When Acting FBI Director Gray returned from his sick leave in January 1973, he confronted Felt about being the source for Woodward and Bernstein. Gray said he had defended Felt to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Richard G. Kleindienst]]: "You know, Mark, Dick Kleindienst told me I ought to get rid of you. He says White House staff members are concerned that you are the FBI source of leaks to Woodward and Bernstein".&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; Felt replied, "Pat, I haven't leaked anything to anybody."&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt; Gray told Felt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told Kleindienst that you've worked with me in a very competent manner and I'm convinced that you are completely loyal. I told him I was not going to move you out. Kleindienst told me, "Pat, I love you for that."&lt;ref name="GrayRevealsSuspOfFeltLeak"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nixon passes over Felt again===
[[File:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]] departing the [[White House]] on August 9, 1974, shortly before his resignation took effect. Felt's leaks to Woodward spurred the investigations that led to his resignation.]]

On February 17, 1973, Nixon nominated Gray as Hoover's permanent replacement as Director.&lt;ref name="GrayNominated" /&gt; Until then, Gray had been in limbo as Acting Director. In another taped conversation on February 28, Nixon spoke to Dean about Felt's acting as an informant, and mentioned that he had never met him. Gray was forced to resign on April 27, after it was revealed that he had destroyed a file that had been in the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt.&lt;ref name="GrayResigns" /&gt; Gray recommended Felt as his successor.

The day Gray resigned, Kleindienst spoke to Nixon, urging him to appoint Felt as head of the FBI. Nixon instead appointed [[William Ruckelshaus]] as Acting Director. Stanley Kutler reported that Nixon said, "I don't want him. I can't have him. I just talked to Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that is not part of the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there."&lt;ref name="MrClean" /&gt; On another White House tape, from May 11, 1973, Nixon and White House Chief of Staff, [[Alexander M. Haig]], spoke of Felt leaking material to ''The New York Times''. Nixon said, "he's a bad guy, you see." He said that William Sullivan had told him of Felt's ambition to be Director of the Bureau.&lt;ref name="FeltNixonsBadGuy" /&gt;

==Clashes with William Ruckelshaus and resignation==
Felt called his relationship with Ruckelshaus "stormy."&lt;ref name="FeltOnRuckelshausRelStormy" /&gt; In his memoir, Felt describes Ruckelshaus as a "security guard sent to see that the FBI did nothing which would displease Mr. Nixon."&lt;ref name="FeltOnRuckelshausAsSecurityGuard" /&gt;

In mid-1973, ''The New York Times'' published a series of articles about wiretaps that had been ordered by J. Edgar Hoover during his tenure at the FBI. Ruckelshaus believed that the information must have come from someone at the FBI.

In June 1973, Ruckelshaus received a call from someone claiming to be a ''New York Times'' reporter, telling him that Felt was the source of this information.&lt;ref name="princeton alumni news"&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A: William Ruckelshaus '55 on the Watergate Scandal |url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/qa-william-ruckelshaus-55-watergate-scandal |publisher=''Princeton Alumni Weekly'' |first=Bernstein |last=Mark F. |date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, Ruckelshaus met privately with Felt and accused him of leaking information to ''The New York Times'', a charge that Felt adamantly denied.&lt;ref name="the two lives" /&gt; Ruckelshaus told Felt to "sleep on it" and let him know the next day what he wanted to do. Felt resigned from the Bureau the next day, June 22, 1973, ending his thirty-one year career.

In a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus noted the possibility that the original caller was a hoax. He said that he considered Felt's resignation "an admission of guilt" anyway.&lt;ref name="princeton alumni news" /&gt;

Ruckelshaus, who had served only as Acting Director, was replaced several weeks later by [[Clarence M. Kelley]], who had been nominated by Nixon as FBI Director and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

==Trial and conviction==
In the early 1970s, Felt had supervised Operation [[COINTELPRO]], initiated by Hoover in the 1950s. This period of FBI history has generated great controversy for its abuses of private citizens' rights. The FBI was spying on, infiltrating, and disrupting the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-War Movement]], [[Black Panthers]], and other [[New Left]] groups. By 1972 Felt was heading the investigation into the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], which had planted bombs at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], [[the Pentagon]], and the [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department building]]. Felt, along with [[Edward S. Miller]], authorized FBI agents to break into homes secretly in 1972 and 1973, without a [[search warrant]], on nine separate occasions. These kinds of FBI operations were known as "[[black bag jobs]]." The break-ins occurred at five addresses in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], at the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weather Underground members. They did not contribute to the capture of any fugitives. The use of "black bag jobs" by the FBI was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Lawrence (Pun) Plamondon|Plamondon]]'' case, 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

The [[Church Committee]] of Congress revealed the FBI's illegal activities, and many agents were investigated. In 1976, Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins, and recommended against punishment of individual agents who had carried out orders. Felt also stated that Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program ''[[Face the Nation]]'' he would probably be a "scapegoat" for the Bureau's work.&lt;ref name="Scapegoat" /&gt; "I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow," he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were "extralegal", he justified them as protecting the "greater good." Felt said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Griffin B. Bell]], the Attorney General in the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, directed investigation of these cases. On April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants.

The indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the [[United States Code]] and stated Felt and the others:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentText" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Felt told his biographer Ronald Kessler: I was shocked that I was indicted. You would be too, if you did what you thought was in the best interests of the country and someone on technical grounds indicted you.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentShock"/&gt;

Felt, Gray, and Miller were arraigned in Washington, DC on April 20. Seven hundred current and former FBI agents were outside the courthouse applauding the "Washington Three", as Felt referred to himself and his colleagues in his memoir.&lt;ref name="ArraignmentFBIAgentApplause" /&gt; Gray's case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence, on December 11, 1980.

Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of {{usc|18|2236}}. The government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] on September 18, 1980.&lt;ref name="EightPostponements"/&gt; On October 29, former President [[Richard M. Nixon]] appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense. He testified that in authorizing the Bureau to conduct break-ins to gather foreign intelligence information "he was acting on precedents established by a number of Presidential directives dating to 1939." It was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's defense fund, since Felt's legal expenses were running over $600,000 by then. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Mitchell, Kleindienst, [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]], [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], and [[Ramsey Clark]], all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and understood not to be illegal. Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial. (The Bureau used a national security justification for the searches because it alleged the Weather Underground was in the employ of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="NixonTestimony"/&gt;)

The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980. Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Felt was fined $5,000 and Miller was fined $3,500.&lt;ref name="FeltIndictmentShock"/&gt; Writing an OpEd piece in ''The New York Times'' a week after the conviction, attorney [[Roy Cohn]] claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the [[Carter administration]] and it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote the break-ins were the "final dirty trick" of the Nixon administration, and there had been no "personal motive" to their actions.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' praised the convictions, saying "the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution."&lt;ref name="NYTEditorialOnConvictions"/&gt;

Felt and Miller appealed their verdicts.&lt;ref name="PardonReaction"/&gt;

==Pardon==
[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and Miller.]]In a phone call on January 30, 1981, [[Edwin Meese]] encouraged President [[Ronald Reagan]] to issue a pardon. After further encouragement from Felt's former colleagues, President Reagan pardoned Felt and Miller. The pardon was signed on March 26, but was not announced to the public until April 15, 1981.

In the pardon, Reagan wrote:

{{quote|During their long careers, Mark Felt and Edward Miller served the Federal Bureau of Investigation and our nation with great distinction. To punish them further—after 3 years of criminal prosecution proceedings—would not serve the ends of justice.

Their convictions in the U.S. District Court, on appeal at the time I signed the pardons, grew out of their good-faith belief that their actions were necessary to preserve the security interests of our country. The record demonstrates that they acted not with criminal intent, but in the belief that they had grants of authority reaching to the highest levels of government.&lt;ref name="ReaganStatement" /&gt;}}

Nixon sent Felt and Miller bottles of [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] with the note "Justice ultimately prevails."&lt;ref name="NixonChampagneCongrats" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' disapproved in an editorial, saying that the United States "deserved better than a gratuitous revision of the record by the President."&lt;ref name="NYTDisapprovesPardon" /&gt; Felt and Miller said they would seek repayment of their legal fees from the government.

The prosecutor at the trial, [[John W. Nields Jr.]], said, "I would warrant that whoever is responsible for the pardons did not read the record of the trial and did not know the facts of the case." Nields also complained that the White House did not consult with the prosecutors in the case, which was contrary to the usual practice when a pardon was under consideration.&lt;ref name="PardonReaction" /&gt;

Felt said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel very excited and just so pleased that I can hardly contain myself. I am most grateful to the President. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to thank him. It's just like having a heavy burden lifted off your back. This case has been dragging on for five years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a press conference the day of the announcement, Miller said, "I certainly owe the Gipper one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work=Time|title=Watergate Ghosts Rise Again|volume=117|issue=2|year=1981|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter Attorney General [[Griffin Bell]] said he did not object to the pardons, as the convictions had upheld constitutional principles.

Despite their pardons, Felt and Miller won permission from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] to appeal their convictions so as to remove it from their record and to prevent it from being used in civil suits by victims of the break-ins they had ordered.&lt;ref name="FeltMillerAppeal" /&gt; Ultimately, the court restored Felt's law license in 1982, based on Reagan's pardon. In June 1982, Felt and Miller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's security and terrorism subcommittee. They said that the restrictions placed on the FBI by Attorney General [[Edward H. Levi]] were threatening the country's safety.&lt;ref name="FeltMillerDenouncePrivacyAndFOIAActcs" /&gt;

==Family life==
His daughter Joan graduated from high school in Kansas City during his assignment there and attended the [[University of Kansas]] for two years before transferring to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in California to study drama.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/FAMILY-MAN-For-former-G-man-Mark-Felt-life-is-2518170.php |title=Family Man |last=Ryan |first=Joan |date=May 28, 2006 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was an undergraduate, Felt finally settled in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], when he took his post at the FBI Academy.&lt;ref name="Deep Throat's Daughter"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100724.html |title=Deep Throat's Daughter, The Kindred Free Spirit |last=Duke |first=Lynne |date=June 12, 2005 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Watergate scandal, Felt had become estranged from Joan. They had been close during her childhood, but after she graduated from Stanford, she had gone to Chile under a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]] to continue her studies. While there, she became friends with [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Andrés Pascal Allende]], nephew of future president [[Salvador Allende]]. When she returned home, her political views had shifted to the extreme left, putting her in conflict with her conservative father.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

She earned her [[master's degree]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at Stanford,&lt;ref name="Deep Throat's Daughter"/&gt; and then joined a [[hippie]] community in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Felt and his wife went to visit her once and were appalled at her [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] lifestyle and use of drugs; he was reminded of members of the militant Weather Underground that the FBI had been prosecuting. Joan's friends were equally shocked that her father was an FBI agent. Following their visit, Joan cut off most contact with her parents. As a result, and combined with the fact that she did not follow the news, she was unaware of her father's legal problems that arose from the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

Over the years, the stress of following her husband's career as well as from the separation from her daughter, combined with Felt's prosecution had taken their toll on Audrey. During Felt's time in Seattle in 1954, Audrey suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. She developed a dependency on alcohol and had been taking [[antidepressant]]s for years. She had also been hospitalized several times for various ailments. When Felt was put on trial in 1980, she attended the first day, but did not return because she was unable to bear it. In 1984, she committed suicide using Felt's [[revolver]].&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt; Felt and his son Mark Jr., an officer in the [[United States Air Force]], decided to keep this a secret and told Joan that her mother had died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/21/AR2006042101858.html |title=Deep Throat's Other Secret |last=Duke |first=Lynne |date=April 22, 2006 |work=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=May 28, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan did not learn the truth about her mother until 2001.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joan had become an adherent of [[Adi Da]], who had founded a [[new religious movement]] in San Francisco called Adidam, and she was living in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. She had borne three sons{{spaced ndash}}Ludi (later Will), Rob, and Nick, the latter two from another Adidam devotee whom she never married{{spaced ndash}}but her parents had only met Ludi during their visit in 1974. After Audrey's death, Felt began making yearly visits to see Joan and his grandsons, and they also came to visit him and his new girlfriend, who lived in the same apartment complex.&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt;

In 1990, Felt permanently moved to Santa Rosa, leaving behind his entire life in Alexandria. He bought a house where he lived with Joan, and took care of the boys while she worked, teaching at [[Sonoma State University]] and [[Santa Rosa Junior College]].&lt;ref name="FamilyMan" /&gt; He suffered a stroke before 1999, as reported by Kessler in his book ''The Bureau.'' According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home and took Felt to lunch.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. "Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area," Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine."&lt;ref name="Kessler"/&gt;

==Memoir==
Felt published his memoir ''[[The FBI Pyramid|The FBI Pyramid: From the Inside]]'' in 1979. It was co-written with Hoover biographer [[Ralph de Toledano]], though the latter's name appears only in the copyright notice. Toledano in 2005 wrote that the volume was "largely written by me since his original manuscript read like ''[[The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table]]''." Toledano said: Felt swore to me that he was not Deep Throat, and that he had never leaked information to the Woodward-Bernstein team or anyone else. The book was published and bombed.&lt;ref name="Toledano" /&gt;

In his memoir, Felt strongly defended Hoover and his tenure as Director; he condemned the criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the [[Church Committee]] and civil libertarians. He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and [[Privacy Act of 1974]] served only to interfere with government work and helped criminals. (He opens the book with the sentence, "[[The Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact]]", Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]'s comment in his dissent to ''[[Terminiello v. City of Chicago]]'', 337 U.S. 1 (1949)).&lt;ref name="FeltContractorDad"/&gt;

''[[Library Journal]]'' wrote in its review that "at one time Felt was assumed to be Watergate's 'Deep Throat'; in this interesting but hardly sensational memoir, he makes it clear that that honor, if honor it be, lies elsewhere."&lt;ref name="LibraryJournalReview" /&gt;  ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' was highly critical of the book, saying Felt "seeks to perpetuate a view of Hoover and the FBI that is no longer seriously peddled even on the backs of cereal boxes". It said the book contained "a disturbing number of factual errors".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; [[Curt Gentry]] said that Felt was "the keeper of the Hoover flame."&lt;ref name="KeeperHooverFlame" /&gt;

Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent "credence" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat in 2005. "There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&amp;nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep Throat speculation==
{{For|a detailed overview of speculation prior to May 31, 2005|Deep Throat (Watergate)}}
The identity of Deep Throat was debated for more than three decades, and Felt was frequently mentioned as a possibility. An October 1990 ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine article about "Washington secrets" listed the 15 most prominent Deep Throat candidates, including Felt.

Jack Limpert published evidence as early as 1974 that Felt was the informant.&lt;ref name="Limpert" /&gt; On June 25 of that year, a few weeks after ''All the President's Men'' was published, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' ran an editorial, "If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat." It began "W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat." The ''Journal'' quoted Felt saying the character was a "composite" and "I'm just not that kind of person."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; In 1975, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote: "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[grand jury]] investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify. The prosecutor, [[John Stanley Pottinger|J. Stanley Pottinger]], [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights]], discovered that Felt was "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings protected the information from being public.&lt;ref name="GrandJury" /&gt;

In 1992, James Mann, who had been a reporter at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1972 and worked with Woodward, wrote a piece for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', saying the source had to have been within the FBI. He noted Felt as a possibility, but said he could not confirm this.&lt;ref name="MannAtlanticMonthly" /&gt;

[[Alexander P. Butterfield]], the White House aide best known for revealing Nixon's taping system, told the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' in 1995, "I think it was a guy named Mark Felt."&lt;ref name="Butterfield" /&gt; In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the ''Hartford Courant'', citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from [[Port Chester, New York]]. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Nora Ephron]], had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt said to the ''Courant'', "No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?" Bernstein said his son didn't know. "Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never told our children."&lt;ref name="Campmate" /&gt; (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the ''Today Show'' that his wife had never known.)

[[Leonard Garment]], President Nixon's former law partner who became White House counsel after John W. Dean's resignation, ruled Felt out as Deep Throat in his 2000 book ''In Search of Deep Throat''. Garment wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Felt theory was a strong one&amp;nbsp;... Felt had a personal motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover&amp;nbsp;... Felt thought he was a leading candidate to succeed Hoover&amp;nbsp;... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in ''All the President's Men'' simply did not sound to me like a career FBI man.&lt;ref name="GarmentFeltTheoryStrong"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garment said the information leaked to Woodward was inside White House information to which Felt would not have had access. "Felt did not fit."&lt;ref name="GarmentNotFelt"/&gt; (Once the secret was revealed, it was noted Felt did have access to such information because the Bureau's agents were interviewing high-ranking White House officials.)

In 2002, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' profiled Felt. Noting his denial in ''The FBI Pyramid'', the paper wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Curiously, his son—American Airlines pilot Mark Felt—now says that shouldn't be read as a definitive denial, and that he plans to answer the question once-and-for-all in a second memoir. The excerpt of the working draft obtained by the ''Chronicle'' has Felt still denying he's Throat but providing a rationale for why Throat did the right thing.&lt;ref name="SFChronicleFeltsSon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2005, reports surfaced that Woodward had prepared Deep Throat's [[obituary]] because he was near death. Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] was battling cancer at the time (he would die in September 2005), and there was speculation that Rehnquist might have been Deep Throat. Rehnquist was [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], from 1969 to 1971,&lt;ref name="cornell-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/rehnquist.bio.html |title=LII: US Supreme Court: Justice Rehnquist |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Supreme Court until his death in 2005.

==Deep Throat revealed==
''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine revealed that Felt was Deep Throat on May 31, 2005, when it published an article (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by [[John D. O'Connor]], an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt said, "I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat." After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the editor of the ''Washington Post'' during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the ''Vanity Fair'' article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family. They hoped to capitalize on the book deals and other lucrative opportunities which Felt would be offered in order to help pay for his grandchildren's education.&lt;ref name="i'm the guy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507 |title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat |work=Vanity Fair |date=July 2005 |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was unaware that he was Deep Throat for many years. They realized the truth after his retirement, when they became aware of his close friendship with Bob Woodward.

Nixon's Chief Counsel [[Charles Colson]], who served [[prison]] time for his actions in the Nixon White House, said Felt had violated "his oath to keep this nation's secrets".&lt;ref name="CharlesColston"/&gt; A ''Los Angeles Times'' editorial argued that this argument was specious, "as if there's no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up [[hush money]] to silence your hired burglars."&lt;ref name="LATimesEditorial"/&gt; [[Ralph de Toledano]], who co-wrote Felt's 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano's half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid. He attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A few days before the ''Vanity Fair'' article was released, Toledano finally received a check.

He later said: "I had been gloriously and illegally deceived, and Deep Throat was, in characteristic style, back in business—which given his history of betrayal, was par for the course."&lt;ref name="Toledano"/&gt;

After the revelation, publishers were interested in signing Felt to a book deal. Weeks later, PublicAffairs Books announced that it signed a deal with Felt. Its [[CEO]] was a ''Washington Post'' reporter and editor during the Watergate era. The new book was to include material from Felt's 1979 [[memoir]], plus an update. The new volume was scheduled for publication in early 2006. Felt sold the movie rights to his story to [[Universal Pictures]] for development by [[Tom Hanks]]'s production company, [[Playtone]]. The book and movie deals were valued at US $1 million.&lt;ref name="DealWithHanks"/&gt;  A film based on those rights, ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'', in which Felt is portrayed by [[Liam Neeson]], was released in 2017.

In mid-2005, Woodward published an account of his contacts with Felt, ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}).

==Appraisal of Watergate role==
Public response to Felt and his actions has varied widely since these revelations. In the immediate aftermath, Felt's family called him an "American hero", suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. [[G. Gordon Liddy]], who was convicted of burglary in the Watergate scandal, said Felt should have gone to the grand jury rather than leak.&lt;ref name="GGordonLiddy"/&gt;

Speculation about Felt's motives for leaking has varied widely. Some suggested that it was revenge for Nixon's choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI.

Political scientist [[George Friedman]] argued: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Washington Post'' created a morality play about an out-of-control government brought to heel by two young, enterprising journalists and a courageous newspaper. That simply wasn't what happened. Instead, it was about the FBI using ''The Washington Post'' to leak information to destroy the president, and ''The Washington Post'' willingly serving as the conduit for that information while withholding an essential dimension of the story by concealing Deep Throat's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/the_deeper_truth_about_deep_throat/ |title=The deeper truth about Deep Throat |publisher=MercatorNet |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 2012 book ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', [[Max Holland]] argued that Felt leaked the information in an attempt to become head of the FBI. Holland said that Felt wanted to create the perception that Gray "could not control the FBI". This could result in Nixon's firing Gray, leaving Felt as the obvious choice to run the agency. Holland said this plan (if it was one) backfired as Nixon and his team found out that Felt was the leaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What made Deep Throat leak? |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2012/02/21/what-made-deep-throat-leak/ |first=Jack |last=Shafer |publisher=Reuters Blogs |date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Felt died at home, in his sleep, on December 18, 2008.&lt;ref name="wp12182008"&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/19/AR2008121900056.html|title=Lawman's Unwavering Compass Led Him to White House Showdown|author=Sullivan, Patricia|date=December 20, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 95 years old and his death was attributed to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-felt19-2008dec19-story.html|author=Neuman, Johanna |title=W.

'''Micro-donation''' or '''microphilanthropy''' is a form of [[Charity (practice)|charitable donation]] that is small in the donated amount. In the past{{when|date=January 2015}}, micro-donations have been used most effectively by companies collecting spare change at registers and checkouts. Recently{{when|date=January 2015}}, this form of [[philanthropy]] has become more popular with the advent of online and [[mobile donating]].
  
In addition to the more traditional forms of donating, like giving directly from person to person, both the internet and mobile-phones have become more accepted by the public for collecting donations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Micro-donations of $200 or less have made up an ever-larger share of nomination fundraising in the three [[United States presidential primary]] elections since 2000. (In this measurement a person who donates $190 twice to a candidate has given two micro-donations, but is not a micro-donor). Micro-donations accounted for 25% of the total donations for the [[United States presidential election, 2000|United States presidential election in 2000]]. This figure rose to 34% in 2004 and 38.8% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Malbin, Michael J. (2006). “A Public Funding System in Jeopardy: Lessons from the Presidential Nomination Contest of 2004.” In The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (Michael Malbin, ed.) 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=CFI Release|title=After Holding Financial Advantage in Primaries, Obama Likely to Achieve Only Parity with McCain in General Election|url=http://www.cfinst.org/press/PReleases/08-09-25/After_Holding_Financial_Advantage_in_Primaries_Obama_Likely_to_Achieve_Only_Parity_with_McCain_in_General_Election.aspx|date=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasen, Richard L.: ''More Supply, More Demand: The Changing Nature of Campaign Financing for Presidential Primary Candidates'', (December 1, 2008). Loyola-LA Legal Studies Paper No. 2008-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting technology==
Microphilanthropy requires the ability to deal with a large number of small interactions efficiently. If a successful approach also includes implementing a fundraising drive that utilizes microphilanthropic resources connected to a specific charity, the approach must also include a structure or "middleman" technology that allows for an effective, efficient aggregation and distribution of microphilanthropic donations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} For example, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] offers an [[eBay]]-style peer-to-peer [[microlending]] platform, which uses internet and mobile phone technology to deliver services between lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.zidisha.org/editables/news_docs/AP_Aug2010.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328160901/https://www.zidisha.org/editables/news_docs/AP_Aug2010.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2014|title=A Microloan "eBay" for African Entrepreneurs|work=Afrikan Post|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">'''Mutual liberty''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835 work ''[[Democracy in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Tocqueville was referring to the general nature of [[United States|American]] [[society]] during the 19th century. It appeared to him, at least on the surface, that every [[citizen]] in the [[United States]] had the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] to participate in the civic activities of the [[country]]. Another way to look at mutual liberty is by accounting for the collective [[free will]]s of every rational being in a [[community]]. Even though the notion of mutual liberty was introduced by Tocqueville, it was [[John Stuart Mill]] who greatly expanded it.&lt;ref name=mill&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''On Liberty and Utilitarianism'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1993), 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill believed that the most proper occasion for mutual liberty was in a community governed by the [[consent of the governed]], i.e., a [[republic]].&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; And according to Mill, it is only in a republic where members of all political [[Political faction|factions]] can participate.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; It has been said that a republic is the form of government that divides people least.&lt;ref&gt;James McMillan, ''Modern France: 1880–2002'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement pertains greatly to mutual liberty. Unlike [[positive liberty|positive]] and [[negative liberty]], mutual liberty encompasses all citizens. It makes no distinction between political preference and social status. Mutual liberty pervades all sectors of society, from the homeless man on the street to the premier of the [[State (polity)|state]]. It is the process through which a general sense of [[morality]] gets exerted on the widest range of people in any given communal setting.

The '''nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis''' is a hypothesis to explain several mammalian traits. In 1942, [[Gordon Lynn Walls]] described this concept which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting with their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|demise of the dinosaurs]] 66 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Gerkema MP, Davies WI, Foster RG, Menaker M, Hut RA.

Proc Biol Sci. 2013 Jul 3;280(1765):20130508. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.0508&lt;/ref&gt; While some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches, the approximately 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology, and most mammals are still nocturnal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sinn|first1=J.|title=New Study Shows Effects of Prehistoric Nocturnal Life on Mammalian Vision|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2012/10/29/effects-prehistoric-nocturnal-life-mammalian-vision/|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Evolution of mammals}}
Mammals evolved from [[cynodont]]s, a group of superficially dog-like [[synapsid|mammal-like reptiles]] in the wake of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic mass extinction]]. The emerging [[archosaur]]ian groups that flourished after the extinction, including [[crocodiles]] and [[dinosaurs]] and their ancestors, drove the remaining larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only the smaller forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|authorlink = Michael Benton|title=Vertebrate palaeontology|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-632-05637-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied [[insectivore|insectivorous]] dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kielan-Jaworowska|first1=Zofia|last2=Cifelli,|first2=Richard L.|last3=Luo|first3=Zhe-Xi|title=Mammals from the age of dinosaurs : origins, evolution, and structure|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11918-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early mammals continued to develop into several probably quite common groups of animals during the [[Mesozoic]], they all remained nocturnal.

Only with the massive extinction at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] did the dinosaurs leave the stage open for the establishment of a new fauna of mammals. Despite this, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Than|first1=K.|title=Rise of Modern Mammals Occurred Long After Dinosaur Demise|url=http://www.livescience.com/7230-rise-modern-mammals-occurred-long-dinosaur-demise.html|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small nocturnal animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gamberale-Stille|first1=G.|last2=Hall|first2=K.

Several different features of mammalian physiology appear to be adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle, mainly related to the sensory organs. These include:

===Senses===
* Acute sense of hearing, including external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] and auditory [[ossicles]].
* Very good sense of smell, well developed [[Nasal concha|nasal turbinate]]s.
* Well developed sense of touch, and particularly the [[whiskers]].&lt;ref name=scholarpedia&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Whisking_behavior |title=Vibrissal behaviour and function|journal=Scholarpedia | volume= 6|page=6642 | accessdate=October 29, 2011 | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6642 | year=2011 | last1=Grant | first1=Robyn | last2=Mitchinson | first2=Ben | last3=Prescott | first3=Tony | issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* With the exception of higher primates, very large [[cornea]], giving a less acute visual image compared to birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=M.

===Physiology===
* Unique type of [[brown adipose tissue]], allowing mammals to generate heat quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cannon|first1=B.|title=Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=1 January 2004|volume=84|issue=1|pages=277–359|doi=10.1152/physrev.00015.2003|pmid=14715917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fur to assist in thermo-regulation in a cold (night) environment.
* Lack of shielding mechanism against (diurnal) [[ultraviolet]] light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringvold|first1=Amund|title=Aqueous humour and ultraviolet radiation|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica|date=27 May 2009|volume=58|issue=1|pages=69–82|doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.1980.tb04567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviour===
* [[Circadian rhythm]] and behaviour patterns in all basal groups are nocturnal, at least in [[placentalia|placentals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerkema|first1=M. P.|last2=Davies|first2=W. I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">The '''Optogalvanic effect''' is the change in the [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of a [[Electric discharge in gases|gas discharge]] induced by a light source (typically a [[laser]]). This effect has found many applications in [[atomic spectroscopy]] and laser stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/rjsgrp/publications/papers/1984/35_pfaff_1984.pdf|title=An investigation of the laser optogalvanic effect for atoms and molecules in recombination-limited plasmas|year=1984|last1=Pfaff|first1=J.|last2=Begemann|first2=M.

==Introduction==

In general, light will couple to atomic transitions if the energy difference between atomic levels is in resonance with some of the frequencies of the incoming light, thereby exchanging energy and momentum. In a gas discharge, the gaseous medium is affected by light on resonance with the atoms or molecules in the gas, thus creating a new balance in the energetic properties of the medium. Since the medium consists of charged particles, it is not surprising that also its electrical properties change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/0038-5670/29/3/R03/pdf/0038-5670_29_3_R03.pdf|title=Optogalvanic effect in plasmas and gases|year=1986|last1=Ochkin|first1=V.

'''Edison Pieter Rumaropen''' (born 13 November 1983 in [[Biak Numfor Regency]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], [[Indonesia]]) is an Indonesian former [[association football|football]] player who last played for [[Persiwa Wamena]]. His position was [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and [[midfielder]].

During a league match against [[Pelita Bandung Raya]] on 21 April 2013, Rumaropen assaulted the referee, punching him in the face after he had awarded a penalty against Persiwa Wamena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/dtotd-indonesian-referee-punched-face-awarding-penalty-143251403--sow.html | title=DTotD: Indonesian referee punched in the face after awarding penalty | accessdate=2013-04-23 | author=Bailey, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official left the field, bleeding from his torn lower lip, and Rumaropen was given a red card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Football-referee-gets-punched-in-face/tabid/415/articleID/295396/Default.aspx|work=3 News | title= Football referee gets punched in face| date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the assault Rumaropen was banned for life by PSSI, the [[Football Association of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/indonesian-striker-gets-life-ban-for-punching-referee-1.263519 News | title=Indonesian striker gets life ban for punching referee | date=April 24, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425103123/http://www.nst.com.my/latest/indonesian-striker-gets-life-ban-for-punching-referee-1.263519 | archivedate=April 25, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite of the life ban, Ruparopen still played for Persiwa Wamena on Premier League after getting relegated from Super League that year.

In [[psychology]] and [[ethology]], '''play''' is a range of [[free will|voluntary]], [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsically motivated]] activities done for [[recreational]] pleasure and enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, C. (1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably [[mammals]].

Many prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including [[Melanie Klein]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.

Play is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a [[game]]. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.&lt;ref name=Huizinga&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0 7100 0578 4|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.

== Definitions ==
The seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt;{{rp|13}}
{{quote|"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means."}}

This definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the "magic circle" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt; Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, "the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
[[File:July 4th Traditions (7188250241).jpg|thumbnail|People having fun]]
Play can take the form of improvisation or pretence, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Nachmanovitch writes that:

{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}

Structured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a "[[game]]". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of [[happiness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Sports]] with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in [[Soccer]] for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt;

Other designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.

The California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:&lt;ref name="nifplay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science – Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.
# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.
# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.
# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.
# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.
# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.
# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.

Separate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]]. Play that promotes [[learning]] and recreation often incorporates [[toys]], [[theatrical property|props]], [[tools]] or other [[wikt:playmate|playmate]]s. Play can consist of an amusing, pretend or imaginary activity alone or with another. Some forms of play are rehearsals or trials for later life events, such as "play fighting", pretend social encounters (such as parties with dolls), or flirting.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton-Smith, B. (1997). ''The Ambiguity of Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Modern findings in [[neuroscience]] suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff &amp; Phillips, 2000).{{full citation needed|date=February 2013}}

As children get older, they engage in board games, video games and computer play, and in this context the word [[gameplay]] is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design. In their book, ''Rules of Play'', researchers Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman outline 18 schemas for games, using them to define "play", "interaction" and "design" formally for behaviorists.&lt;ref&gt;Salen, Katie and Zimmerman, Eric (2003). ''Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his book ''Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds'', game researcher and theorist Jesper Juul explores the relationship between real rules and unreal scenarios in play, such as winning or losing a game in the real world when played together with real-world friends, but doing so by slaying a dragon in the fantasy world presented in the shared video game.&lt;ref&gt;Juul, Jesper (2011).

[[Learning through play]] has been long recognized as a critical aspect of [[childhood]] and [[child development]]. Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1542/peds.2006-2697 | pmid=17200287 | volume=119 | issue=1 | title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds | year=2007 | journal=Pediatrics | pages=182–191 | last1 = Ginsburg | first1 = K.

Modern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.

Studies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein &amp; Russ, 2000–2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Frankel, &amp; Camras, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.

Evolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.

Play is explicitly recognized in Article 31 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (adopted by the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]], November 29, 1989), which declares:
* Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.
* Parties shall respect and promote the right of the child to participate fully in cultural and artistic life and shall encourage the provision of appropriate and equal opportunities for cultural, artistic, recreational and leisure activities.

===History of childhood playtime===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Children’s Games - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Children's Games'', 1560, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]
American historian Howard Chudacoff has studied the interplay between parental control of [[toy]]s and games and children's drive for freedom to play. In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=WHAT PARK DID YOU HANG OUT AT?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child’s individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008). NYU Press, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural differences of play ==
The act of play time is a cross-cultural phenomenon that is universally accepted and encouraged by most communities however it can differ in the ways that is performed.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=orpc|title=Cultural Variations in Parental Support of Children's Play|last=Vandermaas-Peeler|first=Maureen|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures, such as Euro-American cultural heritages, encourage play time in order to stress cognitive benefits and the importance of learning how to care for one’s self. Other cultures, such as people of African American or Asian American heritages, stress more group oriented learning and play where kids can learn what they can do with and for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ehyun/10041/culture_and_development_in.htm|title=Culture and Development in Children's Play|website=ruby.fgcu.edu|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parent interactions when it comes to playtime also differs drastically within communities. Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities. In the Mayan community, children are supported in their playing but also encouraged to play while watching their parents do household work in order to become familiar with how to follow in their footsteps.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In addition, cultural communities also partake in similar games just with slight differences. Children in contemporary industrialized social cultural contexts will spend much of their free play time viewing television or other electronic activity such as video games. People from the Brazilian community use the tools and materials around them to create a form of play. For instance they use mud balls or cashews to play marbles, a game many communities play with small [[marbles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/play/according-experts/play-and-cultural-context|title=Play {{!}} Play and Cultural Context {{!}} Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|website=Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communities in the Sahara will use clay figures as their forms of playful toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossie|first=Jean-Pierre|title=Toys, Play, Culture and Society. An anthropological approach with reference to North Africa and the Sahara|url=https://www.academia.edu/5180690|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children from [[Australia]] and [[Nepal]] will engage in [[Mud pie|mud play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naeyc.org/our-work/families/mud-explore-and-learn|title=Mud: Explore and Learn {{!}} NAEYC|website=www.naeyc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play time can also be used as a way for children to learn the mature ways of their culture. Many communities use play as a way children can emulate work. For instance, children can be seen comforting their toy dolls or animals something that they have modeled from adults in their communities. Children from San Pedro and Efe can be seen making ‘food’ from dirt or pretending to shoot bows and arrows much like their elders. The way in which children mimic work through their play can differ with what opportunities they have access to but is something that tends to be promoted by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morelli|first=Gilda|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|last3=Angelillo|first3=Cathy|date=|title=Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialised child-focused activities|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=|pages=269|url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~brogoff/Psych247articles/Morelli%20et%20al%20Cultural%20Var%20in%20Young%20Children's%20Access.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Sportive activities are one of the most universal forms of play. Different continents have their own popular/dominant sports. For example, [[Europea]]n, [[South America]]n, and [[Africa]]n countries enjoy [[soccer]] (also known as ‘[[football]]’ in [[Europe]]), while [[North America]]n countries prefer [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], or [[American football]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Top 10|title=Top 10 Most Popular Sports in The World|url=http://www.sportyghost.com/top-10-most-popular-sports-in-the-world/|website=SPORTY GHOST! |accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Asia]], sports such as [[table tennis]] and [[badminton]] are played professionally; however [[soccer]] and [[basketball]] are played amongst common folks.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Events such as The [[Olympic Games]] and [[FIFA World Cup]] showcase countries competing with each other and are broadcast all over the world.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Germany-world-cup-winners.jpg|thumbnail|2014 FIFA World Cup winner (Germany)]] --&gt;
[[Sports]] can be played as a [[leisure]] activity or within a [[competition]]. According to sociologist [[Norbert Elias]]; it is an important part of "civilization process".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheed|first1=Wilson|title=Endangered pastimes: Why sports matter|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|date=1995|volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victory]] and [[Failure|defeat]] in sports can also influence one’s [[emotions]] to a point where everything else seems so irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sport fans can also imagine what it feels like to play for their preferred team.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The feelings people experience can be so surreal that it affects their emotions and behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Benefits in youth===
Youth sport can provide a positive outcome for youth development. Research shows adolescents are more motivated and engaged in sports than any other activity,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=R|last2=Kleiber|first2=D.

Dramatic play is common in younger children.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For the youth community to benefit from playtime, the following are recommended: 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 6.png|thumbnail|Research findings on benefits of youth playing sports]] --&gt;
* Give children ample, unscheduled time to be creative to reflect and decompress&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Give children “true” toys, such as blocks or dolls for creativity&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Youth should have a group of supportive people around them (teammates, coaches, and parents) with positive relationships &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should possess skill development; such as physical, interpersonal, and knowledge about the sport &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should be able to make their own decisions about their sport participation &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should have experiences that are on par with their certain needs and developmental level &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Research findings on benefits in youth===
With regular participation in a variety of sports, children can develop and become more proficient at various sports skills (including, but not limited to, [[jumping]], [[kicking]], [[running]], [[throwing]], etc.) if the focus is on skill mastery and development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Young people participating in sports also develop [[agility]], [[Motor coordination|coordination]], [[endurance]], [[flexibility]], [[speed]], and [[Physical strength|strength]]. More specifically, young [[athletes]] could develop the following &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beets|first1=M. W.|last2=Pitetti|first2=K.

Moreover, research shows that regular participation in sport and physical activity is highly associated with lowering the risk of [[diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[obesity]], and other related diseases. Young people also tend to be more nutrition-conscious in their food choices when participating in sport &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=F.|title=Children's organized sports: A developmental perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2004|volume=75|issue=3|pages=35–41|doi=10.1080/07303084.2004.10608557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kawabe|first1=H.|last2=Murata|first2=K.|last3=Shibata|first3=H.|last4=Hirose|first4=H.|last5=Tsujiola|first5=M.|title=Participation in school sports clubs and related effects on cardiovascular risk factors in young males|journal=Hypertension Research|date=2000|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–232|doi=10.1291/hypres.23.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls involved in sport tend associate with lower chance of teenage [[pregnancy]], begin [[smoking]], and/or developing [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leone|first1=M.|last2=Lariviere|first2=G.|last3=Comtois|first3=A.

==Adults==
[[File:Playing weiqi in Shanghai.jpg|thumbnail|left|Playing [[weiqi]] in Shanghai]]

Although adults who engage in excessive amounts of play may find themselves described as "childish" or "young at heart" by less playful adults, play is actually an important activity, regardless of age. Creativity and happiness can result from adult play, where the objective can be more than fun alone, as in adult expression of the arts, or curiosity-driven science.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_on_creativity_and_play.html "Tim Brown on Creativity and Play,"] [[TED (conference)|TED]] talks&lt;/ref&gt; Some adult "hobbies" are examples of such creative play. In creative professions, such as design, playfulness can remove more serious attitudes (such as shame or embarrassment) that impede brainstorming or artistic experimentation in design.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Imaginative play and role play may allow adult individuals to practice useful habits such as [[learned optimism]], which is helpful in managing fear or [[terror management theory|terrors]]. Play also offers adults the opportunity to practice concepts that may not have been explicitly or formally taught (e.g. how to manage misinformation or deceit). Thus, even though play is just one of many tools used by effective adults, it remains a necessary one.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17play.html?pagewanted=all|title=Taking Play Seriously|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Robin M Henig|date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Workplace==
There has been extensive research when it comes to the benefits of play amongst [[child]]ren, [[youth]], and [[adolescence]]. Most commonly overlooked are the benefits of play for adults, more specifically, adults who spend a lot of time in the workplace. Many adults in North America are in the workforce and spend half of their waking hours in a workplace environment with little to no time for play.&lt;ref&gt;Prodaniuk, Plotnikoff, Spence, &amp; Wilson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Play in this context refers to leisure-type activities with colleagues during lunch breaks or short breaks throughout the working day. Leisure activities could include, but are not limited to, different forms of physical [[sport]] activities, [[card games]], [[board games]], [[video games]] and interaction-based type video [[games]], [[foosball]], [[ping-pong]], [[yoga]], and boot-camp sessions.

Research shows that playing games may promote a persistent and optimistic motivational style and [[positive affect]].&lt;ref name="Ventura et al., 2013"&gt;Ventura et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affect enhances people’s experiences, [[enjoyment]], and sense of [[Contentment|satisfaction]] derived from the activity, during their engagement with a certain task. While people are engaged in their work, positive affect increases the satisfaction they feel from the work, and this has also been shown to increase their [[creativity]] and improve their performance on [[problem-solving]] tasks as well as other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Erez &amp; Isen, 2002; Isen, Daubman, &amp; Nowicki, 1987; Staw &amp; Barsade, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive affect may lead to lasting work success.&lt;ref name="Ventura et al., 2013"/&gt;

Studies show that work and play are mutually supportive. Employees need to experience the sense of newness, [[flow (psychology)|flow]], [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] and liveliness that play provides. By doing this, it will provide the employee with the sense that they are integrated within the organization, and therefore they will feel and perform better.&lt;ref name="playaboutit.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://playaboutit.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/workplace-remedy/|title=Workplace Remedy|date=4 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By incorporating play at work, it will also result in more [[productivity]], [[creativity]] and innovation, higher job satisfaction, greater workplace [[morale]], stronger or new social bonds, improved job performance, a decrease in staff turnover, [[absenteeism]] &lt;ref name="helpguide.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/emotional-health/benefits-of-play-for-adults.htm|title=The Benefits of Play for Adults|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress. Decreased stress leads to less illness, which results in lower health care costs.&lt;ref name="playaboutit.wordpress.com"/&gt; Play at work may help employees function and cope when under stress, refresh body and mind, encourage teamwork, trigger creativity, and increase energy while preventing burnout.&lt;ref name="helpguide.org"/&gt;

Studies show that companies that encourage play at work, whether short breaks throughout the day or during lunch breaks experience more success because it leads to positive emotion amongst employees. Risk taking, confidence in presenting novel ideas, and embracing unusual and fresh perspectives are common characteristics associated with play at work.&lt;ref name="Better Way 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://playaboutit.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/all-work-and-no-play-theres-a-better-way/|title=“All Work and No Play? There’s A Better Way”|date=18 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play can increase self-reported job satisfaction and well-being. Employees experiencing positive emotions are more cooperative, more social, and perform better when faced with complex tasks.&lt;ref name="Better Way 2011"/&gt;

Contests, team-building exercises, fitness programs, mental health breaks and other social activities, will make the work environment fun, interactive, and rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrhero.com/hl/articles/2007/02/23/playing-at-work-and-working-at-play/|title=HR Hero Line Archives - HR Daily Advisor|website=HR Daily Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also playfighting, i. e. playful fights or fictive disputes, may contribute to organizations and institutions, as in youth care settings. Staff tries to down-key playfight invitations to “treatment” or “learning,” but playfighting also offers youth and staff identificatory respite from the institutional regime. Wästerfors (2016) has found that playfighting is a recurrent pattern in the social life of a youth care institution and sits at the core of what inmates and staff have to deal with &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891241614554087|title=Playfights as Trouble and Respite|first=David|last=Wästerfors|date=1 April 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=45|issue=2|pages=168–197|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0891241614554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the data surrounding children and adults, play and activity are associated with improved health and quality of life among seniors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Fun Culture in Seniors' Online Communities|last = Nimrod|first = Galit|date = 2010|journal = The Gerontologist|doi = 10.1093/geront/gnq084|pmid = 21030471|access-date =|volume=51|issue = 2|pages=226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, play and activity tend to affect successful aging as well as boost well-being throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although children, adults, and seniors all tend to benefit from play, older adults often perform it in unique ways to account for possible issues, such as health restrictions, limited accessibility, and revised priorities.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For this reason, elderly people may partake in physical exercise groups, interactive [[video games]], and social forums specifically geared towards their needs and interests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aarhus|first1=Rikke|last2=Gronvall|first2=Erik|last3=Larsen|first3=Simon B.|last4=Wollsen|first4=Susanne|title=Turing Training into play: Emobodied gaming, seniors, physical training and motivation|journal=Gerontechnology|date=2011|volume=10|issue=2|pages=110–120|doi=10.4017/gt.2011.10.2.005.00}}&lt;/ref&gt; One qualitative research study found older adults often chose to engage in specific games such as [[dominoes]], [[checkers]], and [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppes|first1=S.|last2=Hally|first2=C.|last3=Sewell|first3=L.|title=An interest inventory of games for older adults|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Geriatrics|date=2000|volume=18|issue=2|pages=71–83|doi=10.1300/j148v18n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated a common pattern within game preferences among older adults; seniors often favor activities that encourage mental and physical fitness, incorporate past interests, have some level of competition, and foster a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppes|first1=S.|last2=Wilcox|first2=T.|last3=Graham|first3=G.|title=Meanings of play for older adults|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Geriatrics|date=2001|volume=18|issue=3|pages=57–68|doi=10.1300/j148v18n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers investigating play in older adults are also interested in the benefits of technology and video games as therapeutic tools. Studies show these outlets can lower the risk of developing particular diseases, reduce feelings of [[social isolation]] and stress, as well as promote creativity and the maintenance of cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; As a result, play as been integrated into physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions for seniors.&lt;ref name="seniors :5"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10220/18214 Jung, Y., Li, K. J., Ng, J. S., Wong, G. L. C.,&amp; Lee, K. (2009). Proceedings from the 6th Australasian Conference on Interactive Entertainment. Australia. retrieved from  hdl.handle.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to incorporate play into one's routine is important because these activities allow participants to express creativity,&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; improve verbal and non-verbal intelligence&lt;ref name="seniors :5" /&gt; as well as enhance balance.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These benefits may be especially crucial to seniors because evidence shows cognitive and physical functioning declines with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, other research argues it might not be aging that is associated with the decline in cognitive and physical capabilities. More specifically, some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;

With attention to these hypotheses, research shows play and activity tend to decline with age&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation, depression, and mobility issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; American studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; In comparison to other age groups, the elderly are more likely to experience a variety of barriers, such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues, that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costello|first1=Ellen|last2=Kafchinski|first2=Marcia|last3=Vrazel|first3=JoEllen|last4=Sullivan|first4=Patricia|title=Motivators, Barriers, and Beliefs Regarding Physical Activity in an Older Adult Population|journal=Geriatric Physical Therapy|date=2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=138–147|doi=10.1519/jpt.0b013e31820e0e71|pmid=21937904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although playing may benefit seniors, it also has the potential to negatively impact their health. For example, those who play may be more susceptible to injury.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt; Investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures, such as establishing safer recreational areas, that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;

A significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens.&lt;ref name="seniors :5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; In order to support and promote play within the older population, studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment,&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt; improve conditions within recreational areas,&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt; and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors.&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;

==Animals==

Evolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play, as there are so many reasons to avoid it. Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a [[polar bear]] and a [[dog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital.html "Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,"] TED talks&lt;/ref&gt; Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.&lt;ref name = "Berghänel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berghänel | first1 = A. | last2 = Schülke | first2 = O. | last3 = Ostner | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Locomotor play drives motor skill acquisition at the expense of growth: A life history trade-off | url = | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7| pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500451 | pmid = 26601237 | pmc = 4643810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the "attention-getting skill" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=20aea8a7-b668-4884-a5ff-d5902a45bbf3@sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=psyh&amp;AN=2009-00693-011|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observing play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?sid=9cb49118-94c7-47f6-bc46-c8a943726bc9@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=127&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=psyh&amp;AN=2011-16747-001|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory – "play as preparation" – was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.&lt;ref name="Berghänel" /&gt; While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

John Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&amp;nbsp;– part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Marc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a "flexibility" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid "false endpoints". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works "well enough", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; A study on two species of monkeys ''Presbytis entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.&lt;ref&gt;B. Ram Manohar and Reena Mathur (1992) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48732562 Interspecific Play Behaviour between Hanuman Langur ''Presbytis entellus'' and Rhesus Macaque ''Macaca mulatta''] Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 89(1):114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Play has varying effects and benefits to human development. There has been an abundance of research on the effects of different forms of play and how they influence various areas of a person’s life whether it is a child or an adult. These benefits of play can have cognitive, social and emotional or motivational effects on a person’s life or development.

=== Cognitive development===
'''Physical play'''

Various forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="cognitive:1" &gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2207676.2208323 | title=The acute cognitive benefits of casual exergame play | year=2012 | journal=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '12 | pages=1863 | last1 = Gao | first1 = Yue | last2 = Mandryk | first2 = Regan| isbn=9781450310154 | citeseerx=10.1.1.248.3183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers did a study and have developed an "exergame" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise. These games increase one’s heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties &lt;ref name="cognitive:1" /&gt; 
In this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions. The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.&lt;ref name="cognitive:1" /&gt;
  
'''Mental play'''

On the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),
"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities – when playing [[video game]] occurs in moderation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743598 Hollis, S. D. (2014). Cognitive effects and academic consequences of video game playing (Order No. 1566326).]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social development and play'''

Play can also influence one’s social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that "integral to positive development is the child’s social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.&lt;ref name="social:4"&gt;Sullivan, C. (2003). [https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/2271/1/MQ83828.pdf The benefits of parent-child play for the social development of preschoolers	with varying levels of anxiety problems]. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play&lt;ref name="social:4" /&gt; Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">In [[mathematics]], the '''relative interior''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a refinement of the concept of the [[interior (topology)|interior]], which is often more useful when dealing with low-dimensional sets placed in higher-dimensional spaces.

Formally, the relative interior of a set ''S'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(S)&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as its [[interior (topology)|interior]] within the [[affine hull]] of ''S''.&lt;ref name="Zalinescu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zălinescu|first=C.|title=Convex analysis in general vector spaces|publisher=World Scientific Publishing&amp;nbsp; Co.,&amp;nbsp;Inc|location=River Edge,&amp;nbsp;NJ|year= 2002|pages=2–3|isbn=981-238-067-1|mr=1921556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(S) := \{ x \in S : \exists\epsilon &gt; 0, N_\epsilon(x) \cap \operatorname{aff}(S) \subseteq S \},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{aff}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the affine hull of ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;N_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Any metric can be used for the construction of the ball; all metrics define the same set as the relative interior.

For any nonempty [[convex set]] &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; the relative interior can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{relint}(C) := \{x \in C : \forall {y \in C} \; \exists {\lambda &gt; 1}: \lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in C\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rockafellar, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16713">'''Righteousness''' is defined as "the quality of being morally correct and justifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered synonymous with "rightness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rightness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[concept]] that can be found in Dharmic traditions and Abrahamic traditions as a theological concept. For example, from various perspectives in [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]] it is considered an [[Property_(philosophy)|attribute]] that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been "judged" or "reckoned" as leading a life that is pleasing to God.. It is also found in [[Tamil language|tamil literature]]  in the name of அறம்(aram).Tamil Custom known for it's righteousness.In Tamil literature there is separate section called [[அற நூல்கள்]] righteous books for example [[thirukkural]] [[Nālaṭiyār|nalatiyar]] and many more books.[[tirukkural]] dedicated 1-38 chapters [[Book of Virtues|Book of aram]] for righteousness.A poem in [[purananuru]] written by [[Kaniyan Pungundranar|kaniyanpoongundranar]] it showcases the practice of righteousness leads to [[World peace|worldpeace]] and harmony in society.

[[William Tyndale]] ([[Tyndale Bible|Bible translator]] into English in 1526) remodelled the word after an earlier word ''rihtwis'', which would have yielded [[modern English]] *''rightwise'' or *''rightways''. He used it to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root צדקים (''TzDYQ''), ''[[Tzadik|tzedek]]'', which appears over five hundred times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|δίκαιος}} (''dikaios''), which appears more than two hundred times in the [[New Testament]].

==Philosophy, history, linguistics, meanings, and translation==
In the word "righteousness," the suffix "-ness" modifies the adjective "righteous," which is "right" modified by "-ous." Righteousness is a [[phenomenon]] or state or condition of: resembling or displaying the nature of moral, good, correct, true, factual, excellent, just, virtuous, natural, morally upright, correct for situations, balanced, and honorable being or being in such a state. 

Origin
Old English rihtwīs, from riht ‘right’ + wīs ‘manner, state, condition’ (as opposed to ''wrangwise'', "wrongful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=78|year=1855|issue=6|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The change in the ending in the 16th century was due to association with words such as bounteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteous|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics or moral philosophy==
Ethics is a major branch of philosophy, encompasses right conduct and good living.
" Rushworth Kidder states that "standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'".[3] Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".[4] The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word [[Ethics#Defining_ethics|ethics]] is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."

==Connections of concepts in world history==
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|Attributes of]] [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible.
"[[Eusebeia]]" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as "godliness," a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker,[34] on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’, 'laws of nature' and ‘path of ''rightness''’.

"The word εὐσέβεια as it is used in the Greek New Testament carries the meaning of "godliness", and is distinct from θρησκεία (thrēskeia), "religion". Eusebeia relates to real, true, vital, and spiritual relation with God, while thrēskeia relates to the outward acts of religious observances or ceremonies, which can be performed by the flesh. The English word "religion" was never used in the sense of true godliness. It always meant the outward forms of worship. In 1Ti 3:16, the Mystery, or secret connected with true Christianity as distinct from religion, it is the Genitive of relation. (This specific meaning occurs only in Act 3:12.)] This word arises in the Greek New Testament in 1 Tim 2:2, 1 Tim 3:16, 1 Tim 4:7, 1 Tim 4:8, 1 Tim 6:3, 1 Tim 6:5, 1 Tim 6:6, 1 Tim 6:11, 2 Tim 3:5, Tit 1:1, 2 Pt 1:3, 2 Pt 1:6, 2 Pt 1:7, 2 Pt 3:11.[7]"

==Yi (Confucianism)==
{{main article|Yi (Confucianism)}}
[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yi]], (Chinese: 義; simplified Chinese: 义; traditional Chinese: 義; pinyin: yì; Jyutping: Ji6; Zhuyin Fuhao: ㄧˋ), literally "justice, righteousness; meaning," is an important concept in Confucianism. It involves a moral disposition to do good, and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently. Yi resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (ren) and skillful practice (li). Yi represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply virtues "with no loss of sight of the total good. Yi represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." 

  In application, yi is a "complex principle" which includes:
    skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
    the wise recognition of such fitness
    the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.

==Dharmic traditions==

Dharma is a key concept with multiple meanings. There might not be a [[Untranslatability|single-word translation]] for dharma in Western languages. ''Dharma'' धर्म  can be translated as righteousness, religion, faith, duty, law, and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of dharma include rightness, good, natural, morality, righteousness, and virtue. It means moral, right, just, balanced, or natural etc. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’ and ‘path of ''rightness''’. Dharma encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or ''morally upright''. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to satya (truth, Sanskrit: satya सत्यं). "...when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one." — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.xiv

Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4: TEXT 7
   "yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata
   abhyutthanam adharmasya tadatmanam srjamy aham" 

"Whenever there is decay of righteousness, O Bharata, 
And there is exaltation of unrighteousness, then I Myself come forth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asitis.com/4/7.html|title=Bhagavad Gita As It Is, 4.7: Transcendental Knowledge, Text 7.|website=asitis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/05/bhagavad-gita-chapter-4-verse-7-8.html|title=Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 7-8: Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya|website=www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in righteousness/religious practice, Oh descendant of Bharata, and a rise of evil/irreligion— Then at that time I manifest Myself.

In Hindu philosophy and/or religion, major emphasis is placed on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27136.htm|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Including duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’. The Sanskrit epics contain themes and examples where right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. 

In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In his 250 BCE Edicts used the word "[[eusebeia]]" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of "dharma". This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[34] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of ''right,'' of ''good'', of one’s duty.

For Sikhs, the word Dharm means the path of ''righteousness'' and proper religious practice.

The major Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra mentions Das-dharma with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=wikipedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Attributes of God}}
{{main|Tzadik}}
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes]] of [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Its chief meaning concerns [[ethics|ethical]] conduct (for example, [[Leviticus]] 19:36; [[Deuteronomy]] 25:1; [[Psalm]] 1:6; [[Proverb]]s 8:20). In the [[Book of Job]] the title character is introduced to us as a person who is perfect in righteousness.

==Christianity==
{{see also|Sola fide|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
{{External links|section|date=July 2018}}
The New Testament continues the Hebrew Bible's tradition of the ethical ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:10}}) and legal ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:4}}) aspects of righteousness. [[William Lane Craig]] argues that we should think of God as the paradigm, the locus, the source of all righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 19)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-19|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's gospel contains the most utterances of the word. In Matthew's account of the baptism encounter Jesus tells the prophet "it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" as Jesus requests that John perform the rite for him. The Sermon of the Mount contains the memorable commandment "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness". The Greek word ''dikaiosune'' also means justice&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert. (May 2011) Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible. p. 819. {{ISBN|978-1-56563-810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sole translation using this rendering for [[Matthew 6:33]] is the [[New English Bible]].

Jesus asserts the importance of righteousness by saying in Matthew 5:20, "For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." Jesus also re-affirms the [[Law of Moses|Laws of Moses]] by saying in Matthew 5:19, "Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

However, [[Paul the Apostle]] speaks of [[dual-covenant theology|two ways]], at least in theory, to achieve righteousness: through the [[Law of Moses]] (or [[Torah]]); and through [[faith]] in the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] made possible through the death and [[resurrection]] of Jesus Christ ({{bibleverse||Romans|10:3-13}}). Some interpret that he repeatedly emphasizes that faith is the only effective way. Reference ({{bibleverse||Romans|4:5}}). ({{bibleverse||Romans|3:21-24}}). For example, just a few verses earlier, he states the Jews did not attain the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith, but by works ({{bibleverse||Romans|9:30-33}}). The New Testament speaks of a salvation founded on God's righteousness, as exemplified throughout the history of salvation narrated in the [[Old Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|9-11}}).
Paul writes to the Romans that righteousness comes by faith: "...a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'" ({{bibleverse||Romans|1:17}})

In [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209&amp;version=NRSV II Cor. 9:9] the New Revised Standard Version has a footnote that the original word has the meaning of 'benevolence' and the Messianic Jewish commentary of David Stern affirms the Jewish practice of 'doing ''tzedakah''' as charity in referring to the Matt. 6 and II Cor. 9 passages.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H. (1992) Jewish New Testament Commentary: A companion volume to the 'Jewish New Testament'. p. 30 and p. 512. {{ISBN|965-359-008-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{bibleverse||James|2:14-26}} speaks of the relationship between works of righteousness and faith, saying that "faith without works is dead." Righteous acts according to James include [[Good works|works of charity]] ({{bibleverse||James|2:15-16}}) as well as avoiding [[Christian views on sin|sins]] against the Law of Moses ({{bibleverse||James|2:11-12}}).

{{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7-8}} describes [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] as a righteous man.

===Type of saint===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], "Righteous" is a [[List of Eastern Orthodox saint titles|type of saint]] who is regarded as a holy person under the [[Old Covenant]] (Old Testament Israel) but also sometimes used for married saints of the [[New Covenant]] (the Church). According to [[Orthodox theology]], the Righteous saints of the Old Covenant were not able to enter into heaven until after the [[death of Jesus]] on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|11:40|KJV}}), but had to await salvation in the [[Bosom of Abraham]] (see: [[Harrowing of Hell]]).

==Islam==
Righteousness is mentioned several times in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wefound.org/texts/Islam_files/IslamRighteousness.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an says that a life of righteousness is the only way to go to Heaven.
{{quote|We will give the home of the Hereafter to those who do not want arrogance or mischief on earth; and the end is best for the righteous.| Qur’an Sura 28: Verse 83}}

{{quote|O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).| Qur'an Surah 49: Verse 13}}

{{quote|Righteousness is not that you turn your faces to the east and the west [in prayer].  But righteous is the one who believes in God, the Last Day, the Angels, the Scripture and the Prophets; who gives his wealth in spite of love for it to kinsfolk, orphans, the poor, the wayfarer, to those who ask and to set slaves free.  And (righteous are) those who pray, pay alms, honor their agreements, and are patient in (times of) poverty, ailment and during conflict.  Such are the people of truth.  And they are the God-Fearing.| Qur'an Surah 2: Verse 177}}

[[File:Gertrude Stein 1935-01-04.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gertrude Stein]], 1935]]
The sentence "'''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.'''" was written by [[Gertrude Stein]] as part of the 1913 poem "Sacred Emily", which appeared in the 1922 book ''Geography and Plays''. In that poem, the first "Rose" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and "'''A rose is a rose is a rose'''" is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/15900.html] Meaning and Origin of this phrase &lt;/ref&gt; "things are what they are", a statement of the [[law of identity]], "A is A". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the [[problem of universals]] debate where [[Peter Abelard]] and others used the ''rose'' as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, "Now listen! I'm no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...' Yes, I'm no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in [[English poetry]] for a hundred years." (''Four in America'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www2.english.uiuc.edu/finnegan/English%20256/gertrude_stein.htm|title=Gertrude Stein|website=Department of English|publisher=University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20030309141326/http://www2.english.uiuc.edu/finnegan/English%20256/gertrude_stein.htm|archivedate=9 March 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She herself said to an audience at [[Oxford University]] that the statement referred to the fact that when the [[romanticism|Romantics]] used the word "rose", it had a direct relationship to an actual rose. For later periods in literature this would no longer be true. The eras following romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.

==Mentions of "rose" in "Sacred Emily"==
The following lines appear at widely separated places in "Sacred Emily":
* ''It is rose in hen.''
* ''Jack Rose Jack Rose.''
* ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.''

== Versions by Gertrude Stein ==
*"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." ("Sacred Emily", ''Geography and Plays'')
*"Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." (''Operas and Plays'')
*"... she would carve on the tree Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose until it went all the way around." (''The World is Round'')
*"A rose tree may be a rose tree may be a rosy rose tree if watered." (''Alphabets and Birthdays'')
*"Indeed a rose is a rose makes a pretty plate...." (''Stanzas in Meditation'')
*"When I said.
:A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:And then later made that into a ring I made poetry and what did I do I caressed completely caressed and addressed a noun."  (''Lectures in America'')
*"Civilization begins with a rose.  A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. It continues with blooming and it fastens clearly upon excellent examples."  (''As Fine as Melanctha'')
*"Lifting belly can please me because it is an occupation I enjoy.
:Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.
:In print on top." (''Bee Time Vine'')

== Variations by others ==
* "A rose is a rose is a rose" quasi-quotation from "Sacred Emily" was also inspiration and one of the meanings behind ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' book by [[Umberto Eco]].{{cn|date=October 2014}}
* "A rose is a rose is a rose" and variants has been contrasted with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] "[[A rose by any other name would smell as sweet]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMNix5ICLKAC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Inner strengths |author=Claire Frederick, Shirley McNeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sentence was heavily promoted by Stein's life partner [[Alice B. Toklas]]; for example, she sold plates with the sentence going all the way around.
* [[Robert Frost]] alludes to Stein's sentence in his poem "The Rose Family", from the [[1929 in literature|1929]] collection ''[[West-Running Brook]]''.
* The sentence was [[parody|parodied]] by [[Ernest Hemingway]] after a brief time in [[Paris]] seeking editorial suggestions for his writing: "a stone is a stein is a rock is a boulder is a pebble." This also appears in his [[1940 in literature|1940 novel]] ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', in which there is yet another parody: "a rose is a rose is an onion." After a (perhaps bitter) falling out, the sentence becomes, "a bitch is a bitch is a bitch is a bitch."
* The sentence appears in the [[1952 in film|1952]] [[musical film]] ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', in the musical number "Moses Supposes". While parodying a dialogue coach, the characters of Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown sing: "...A Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is / A rose is what Moses supposes his toes is / Couldn't be a lily or a taffy daphi dilli / It's gotta be a rose cuz it rhymes with mose!"
* The sentence appears in the 1952 Charlie Chaplin film  [[Limelight_(1952_film)|''Limelight'']]. Chaplin's character expresses it as "The meaning of anything is merely other words for the same thing. After all, a rose is a rose is a rose. That's not bad. It should be quoted."
* [[Aldous Huxley]] paraphrases the quotation in his [[1954 in literature|1954]] book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', writing "A rose is a rose is a rose. But these chair legs were chair legs were St. Michael and all angels."  In his [[1958 in literature|1958]] book, ''[[Brave New World#Brave New World Revisited|Brave New World Revisited]]'', Huxley also referenced the quotation, writing, "An apple is an apple is an apple, whereas the moon is the moon is the moon."
* [[William Carlos Williams]] in a poem "The Pink Locust", appearing in his 1955 collection ''[[Journey to Love (William Carlos Williams)|Journey to Love]]'', quotes "a rose is a rose/ is a rose" as emblematic of the poet's self-deprecation in relation to life. Williams regards the phrase as a slogan of poetic [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]], denying the value of the creative act: the poet feels impotent and recognizes in her art merely a banal repetition of the words we use every day to represent the unrepresentable richness of the natural world. But the following lines of the poem offer an alternative view, one which Williams re-affirmed throughout his career: "A rose ''is'' a rose/ and the poem equals it/ if it be well made."
* In the 1960 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (and its [[1963 in film|1963]] [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|film adaptation]]), the character of Albert Peterson refers to the saying in the song "Rosie", in which he sings, "Oh, I once heard a poem that goes / A rose is a rose is a rose / But I don't agree / Take it from me / There's one rose sweeter than any that grows!"
* In 1968, the Portuguese artist João Vieira (1934-2009) painted the oil on canvas Uma Rosa É [A Rose Is], a work later (1971) reproduced on the cover of Colóquio Artes, # 1, a prestigious cultural magazine issued by Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon.
* [[Rock band]] [[Henry Cow]] sings on their [[Legend (Henry Cow album)|debut album]] "But a rose is a rose is a rose / said the mama of dada as long ago as 1919".
* [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said in 1981 that "A crime is a crime is a crime" in reference to the actions of members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. The sentence has been used by other speakers as well, with the intended meaning of "no matter what you call it, criminal violence is criminal, and illegal."
* In the 1978 film ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'', [[Sherman Brothers|Robert and Richard Sherman]] penned the song, "A Rose Is Not a Rose".
* "Una rosa es una rosa es una rosa", the Spanish translation of Stein's verse, is the chorus of a song by the Spanish pop music group [[Mecano]] that appeared on their 1991 album, ''Aidalai''.  The pop-flamenco song tells the story of a man in love with a woman who by turns hurts and soothes him.
* [[Bret Easton Ellis]] sent up the sentence in his [[1991 in literature|1991]] [[novel]] ''[[American Psycho]]'', as narrator Patrick Bateman utters, "a Rolls is a Rolls is a Rolls" during one of his frequent materialist stream-of-consciousness tirades.
* ''[[A Rose is Still a Rose]]'' was the title of a [[1998 in music|1998]] album and song by [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]. The song, written by Hill, also contains the refrain, "What I am is what I am."
* In the liner notes to the [[1999 in music|1999]] [[The Magnetic Fields]] album ''[[69 Love Songs]]'', frontman [[Stephin Merritt]] credited the sentence as an inspiration for the songs "The Things We Did and Didn't Do" and "The Flowers She Sent and the Flowers She Said She Sent".
* [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[rock music|rock]] band, wrote a song called "[[Roseability]]", which appeared on their [[2000 in music|2000]] album ''[[100 Broken Windows]]''.

In [[epistemology]] (theory of knowledge), a '''self-evident proposition''' is a proposition that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without [[Logical argument|proof]],{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}} and/or by ordinary [[human reason]].

Some epistemologists deny that any proposition can be self-evident. For most others, one's belief that oneself is [[consciousness|conscious]] is offered as an example of self-evidence. However, one's belief that someone else is conscious is not epistemically self-evident.

The following proposition is often said to be self-evident:
* ''A finite whole is greater than, or equal to, any of its parts

Also self evident is the statement that two plus two is equal to four.

A [[logical argument]] for a self-evident conclusion would demonstrate only an ignorance of the purpose of persuasively arguing for the conclusion based on one or more premises that differ from it (see ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' and [[begging the question]]).

==Analytic propositions==
It is sometimes said that a self-evident proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. It is also sometimes said that an [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic proposition]] is one whose denial is self-contradictory. But the concepts mean different things.{{elucidate|date=October 2015}}

Provided that one understands and believes a self-evident proposition, self-evident propositions are not in need of proof. Likewise, that their denial is self-contradictory does not have to be proven. It is in this sense that the self-contradictions at work in self-evident and analytic propositions are different.

Not all analytic propositions are self-evident, and it is sometimes claimed that not all self-evident propositions are analytic: e.g. my knowledge that I am conscious.

==Other uses==
Claims of ''self-evidence'' also exist outside of epistemology.

===Informal speech===
In informal speech, ''self-evident'' often merely means ''obvious'', but the epistemological definition is more strict.

===Moral propositions===
Moral propositions may also be regarded as self-evident. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] cited the following moral propositions as self-evident in the [[Federalist No. 37]]:
* ''The means ought to be proportioned to the end.''
* ''Every power ought to be commensurate with its object.''
* ''There ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation.''

A famous claim of the self-evidence of a moral truth is in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], which states, "We hold these Truths to be ''self-evident'', that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."; philosophically, these propositions' self-evidence is debatable.

Another classic example in epistemology are the claims by the Vedas (Vedanta) to be self-evident.

'''Sexual violence''' is any [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] or attempt to obtain a sexual act by [[violence]] or [[coercion]], acts to [[Human trafficking|traffic]] a person or acts directed against a person's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], regardless of the relationship to the victim.&lt;ref name="WHO definition"&gt;World Health Organization., World report on violence and health (Geneva: [[World Health Organization]], 2002), Chapter 6, pp. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"&gt;[Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and has a profound short or long-term impact on physical and mental health, such as an increased risk of sexual and [[Reproduction|reproductive]] health problems,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes MM et al. Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1996, 175:320–324.&lt;/ref&gt; an increased risk of [[suicide]] or [[HIV]] infection. [[Murder]] occurring either during a [[sexual assault]] or as a result of an [[honor killing]] in response to a sexual assault is also a factor of sexual violence. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from these aspects,&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt; sexual violence can occur to anybody at any age; it is an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances and strangers, as well as intimate partners. It is rarely a [[crime of passion]], and is rather an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings, thus levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is a widely underreported phenomenon, thus available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research, thus deeper understanding of the issue is imperative in order to promote a coordinated movement against it. [[Domestic violence|Domestic sexual violence]] is distinguished from conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007|pp=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape of women and of men is often used as a method of warfare ([[war rape]]), as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured male or female fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if strongly prohibited by [[Human rights law|IHRL]], [[Custom (law)|Customary law]] and [[International humanitarian law|IHL]], enforcement mechanisms are still fragile or even non-existent in many corners of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-879707-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From a historical perspective, sexual violence was considered as only happening to women and as being commonplace and "normal" during both war and peace times from the Ancient Greeks to the 20th century. This led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was. It took until the end of the 20th century for sexual violence to no longer be considered a minor issue and to gradually become criminalized.

== Definitions ==

===General===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health defined sexual violence as: "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work".&lt;ref name="WHO definition"/&gt; WHO's definition of sexual violence includes but is not limited to rape, which is defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the [[vulva]] or [[Human anus|anus]], using a [[Human penis|penis]], other body parts or an object. Sexual violence consists in a purposeful action of which the intention is often to inflict severe humiliation on the victim(s) and diminish human dignity. In the case where others are forced to watch acts of sexual violence, such acts aim at intimidating the larger community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Other acts incorporated in sexual violence are various forms of [[sexual assault]]s, such as forced contact between mouth and penis, vulva or anus.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"&gt;[WHO (2002), ’Sexual violence’, in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 147-181]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can include coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus, or acts that do not involve physical contact between the victim and the perpetrator—for example, sexual harassment, threats, and peeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-factsheet.pdf|title=Understanding Sexual Violence|last=|first=|date=2014|website=www.cdc.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercion, with regard to sexual violence, can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force. Apart from physical force, it may involve [[psychological intimidation]], [[blackmail]] or other threats – for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person being attacked is unable to give consent – for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation.

Such broader definitions of sexual violence are found within international law. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (ICC) has established in article 7(1)(g) that "rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity".&lt;ref&gt;[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Article 7(g) Crimes against humanity]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence is further explained in the ICC's Elements of Crimes, which the Court uses in its interpretation and application of Article 7. The Elements of Crime establishes that sexual violence is:

*"An act of sexual nature against one or more persons or caused such person or persons to engage in an act of sexual nature by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or persons or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment or such person’s or persons’ incapacity to give genuine consent."&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt;

The Special Rapporteur on systemic rape sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, in a report in 1998, stipulated that sexual violence is "any violence, physical or psychological, carried out through sexual means by targeting sexuality". This definition encompasses physical as well as psychological attacks aimed at "a person's sexual characteristics, such as forcing a person to strip naked in public, mutilating a person’s genitals, or slicing off a woman’s breasts".&lt;ref name="McDougall 1998"/&gt; The Special Rapporteur’s definition also refers to situations "in which two victims are forced to perform sexual acts on one another or to harm one another in a sexual manner".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|McDougall|1998|loc=para. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thorough definition is necessary in monitoring the prevalence of sexual violence and studying trends over time. In addition, a consistent definition helps in determining the magnitude of sexual violence and aids in comparing the problem across demographics. Consistency allows researchers to measure risk and protective factors for victimization in a uniform manner. This ultimately informs prevention and intervention efforts.

=== Conflict-related and domestic sexual violence ===
A distinction is made between conflict-related sexual violence and domestic sexual violence:&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"/&gt;

* ''Conflict-related sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by combatants, including rebels, militias, and government forces. The various forms of sexual violence can be used systematically in conflicts "to torture, injure, extract information, degrade, threaten, intimidate or punish".&lt;ref&gt;[Goetz, Ms. Anne Marie (2008), ’Introduction’ at Wilton Park Conference, Women Targeted or Affected by Armed Conflict: What Role for Military Peacekeepers?, 27–28 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can in such cases amount to being a weapon of war. See [[War rape]].
* ''Domestic sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by intimate partners and by other family/household members, and is often termed ''intimate partner violence.'' This kind of sexual violence is widespread both during conflict and in peacetime. It is commonly believed that incidences of domestic sexual violence increase in wartime and in post-conflict environments.

== Victims ==

===Spectrum===
A spectrum of people can fall victim to sexual violence. This includes women, men and children, but also people who define themselves in other terms, e. g. [[transgender]] individuals.

Most research, reports and studies focus on sexual violence against women and sexual violence in armed conflicts. Mainstream narratives on sexual violence also often depict men as perpetrators and women as victims. Indeed, women suffer disproportionately from sexual violence; however, sexual violence is committed by both men and women, and in peacetime as well as during conflict.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"&gt;[Sivakumaran, Sandesh (2007), ”Sexual Violence Against Men in Armed Conflict” in European Journal of International Law, Vol. 18, no.2, pp. 253-276]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for individuals to be targeted based on sexual orientation or gender-exhibiting behavior. Such attacks, which are often called "[[corrective rape]]s" have been performed to conform an individual to a heterosexual orientation or to more accepted notions of behavior for the perceived gender of the victim.

=== Domestic sexual violence ===
{{main|Sexual violence by intimate partners}}

Domestic sexual violence includes all forms of unwanted sexual activity. It is considered abuse even if the victim may have previously engaged in consensual sexual activities with the perpetrator. Men and women can both fall victim to this type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. and Segal, J. (2013). Domestic Violence and Abuse: Signs of Abuse and Abusive Relationships. HelpGuide.  Available at:{{cite web |url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201131946/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 WHO study on physical and sexual domestic violence against women conducted across ten countries, finds that prevalence of sexual domestic violence ranges on average between 10 and 50%. Domestic sexual violence is also considerably less common than other forms of domestic violence. The variations in the findings across and within countries suggest that this type of abuse is not inevitable and can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C., Jansen, H. A., Ellsberg, M., Heise, L., &amp; Watts, C. H. (2006). Prevalence of intimate partner violence: findings from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence. The Lancet, 368(9543), 1260-1269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Sexual violence against women and girls can take many forms and is carried out in different situations and contexts. The WHO’s World Report on Violence and Health&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; lists the following ways in which sexual violence against females can be committed: 
* Systematic rape during armed conflict
* Rape within marriage or dating relationships
* Rape by strangers
* Unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favors
* Sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people
* Sexual abuse of children
* [[Forced marriage]] or cohabitation, including the [[Child marriage|marriage of children]]
* Denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted diseases
* [[Forced abortion]]
* Violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including [[female genital mutilation]] and obligatory inspection for [[virginity]]
* Forced [[prostitution]] and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of people]] for the purpose of sexual exploitation

There was a study in 1987 that came to a conclusion that women in college have reported being involved in unwanted sex due to men using verbal coercion, physical force, and using alcohol an drugs to intoxicate them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality|last=Moore|first=Nelwyn|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2010|isbn=|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York , New York 10016|pages=524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is one of the most common and widespread violations to which women are subject in wartime. It also figures among the most traumatic experiences, both emotionally and psychologically, women suffer during conflict. Sexual violence, in particular rape, is often considered as a method of warfare: it is used not only to "torture, injure, extract information, degrade, displace, intimidate, punish or simply destroy," but also as a strategy to destabilize communities and demoralize men.&lt;ref&gt;[ICRC (2008), Women and War, pp. 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16"&gt;[Thomas, Katie (2007), “Sexual violence: weapon of war” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sexual violence as a weapon of war was widespread conflicts such as Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16" /&gt;
The perpetrators of female-directed violence in times of conflict are often armed groups and local people.&lt;ref&gt;[Egeland, Jan (2007), “International responses” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 8-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with sexual violence against women, sexual violence against men can take different forms, and occur in any kind of context, including at home or in the workplace, in prisons and police custody, and during war and in the military.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; The practice of sexually assaulting males is not confined to any geographical area of the world or its place of commission, and occurs irrespective of the victim’s age.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"&gt;[Solangon, Sarah and Preeti Patel (2012), “Sexual violence against men in countries affected by armed conflict” in Conflict, Security and Development, 12:4, pp. 417-442]&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms of sexual violence directed against males include rape, enforced sterilization, enforced masturbation, and genital violence. Sexual violence against males also encompasses emasculation, which can take place through "[[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]]" or "homosexualization" of the victim, and the prevention of procreation.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

Male-directed sexual violence is more significant than is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor or a lack of documentation. The under- or non-reporting of sexual violence against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[Russell, Wynne (2007), ”Sexual violence against men and boys” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, pp. 22-23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Sivakuraman, Sandesh (2005), “Male/Male Rape and the ‘Taint’ of Homosexuality” in Human Rights Quarterly, Volume 27, Number 4, November 2005, pp. 1274-1306]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to non-reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[Stanko, Elizabeth A. and Kathy Hobdell (1993), “Assault on Men: Masculinity and Male Victimization” in British Journal of Criminology, 33(3), pp. 400-415]&lt;/ref&gt; The incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[Mezey, Gillian C. and Michael B. King (2000), “Treatment for Male Victims of Sexual Assault” in G. Mezey and M. B. King (eds.) Male Victims of Sexual Assault]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of under- and non-reporting on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"/&gt;

In the case that sexual violence against males is recognized and reported, it is often categorized as "abuse" or "torture". This is considered a tendency to hide sexual assaults directed at men as something else, and it is believed to contribute to the poor- or lack of reporting of such crimes, and can arise from the belief that sexual violence is a women's issue and that men cannot be victims of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

=== Children ===
{{main|Child sexual abuse}}
Sexual violence against children is a form of [[child abuse]]. It includes harassment and rape, as well as the use of children in prostitution or pornography.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF(2011)Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse - Sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58006.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (1996). Declaration of the Stockholm Convention. Pg. 1. Available at: http://www.csecworldcongress.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is a serious infringement upon a child's rights, and one which can result in significant physical and psychological trauma to the victim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"&gt;OHCHR (2010). Addressing sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/HRCChildren.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 WHO study approximated that 223 million children have been victims to sexual violence involving physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Global Estimates of Health Consequences due to Violence against Children at note 8, based on estimates by G. Andrews et al., Child sexual abuse, chapter 23 in M. Ezzati et al., (2004) Comparative Quantification of Health Risks: Global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004), vol. 2, pp. 1851-1940, and using data of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs for population under 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, due to the sensitivity of the issue and the tendency of the crime to stay hidden, the true figure is likely to be much higher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"/&gt;

Girls are more frequent targets for sexual abuse than boys. The WHO study found that 150 million girls were abused compared to 73 million boys. Other sources also conclude that girls face a greater risk of sexual violence, including prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro, P. (2006). Rights of the Child: Report of the Independent Expert for the United Nations Study on Violence Against Children. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Pp. 11, 13-14, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and factors==

===Explanations===
{{main|Causes of sexual violence|Factors associated with being a victim of sexual violence}}
Explaining sexual violence is complicated by the multiple forms it takes and contexts in which it occurs. There is considerable overlap between forms of sexual violence and [[intimate partner violence]]. There are factors increasing the risk of someone being coerced into sex, factors increasing the risk of an individual person forcing sex on another person, and factors within the social environment including peers and family influencing the likelihood of rape and the reaction to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitiki|first1=Elizabeth|title=Participation in the anti-sexual violence silent protest: a sexual citizenship perspective|date=2018|publisher=Rhodes University|hdl=10962/62916}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Research suggests that the various factors have an [[Behavioral addiction|additive effect]], so that the more factors present, the greater the likelihood of sexual violence. In addition, a particular factor may vary in importance according to the life stage.

=== Risk factors ===

The following are individual risks factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html|title=Risk and Protective Factors{{!}}Sexual Violence{{!}}Violence Prevention{{!}}Injury Center{{!}}CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-06|date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alcohol and drug use
* Delinquency
* Empathic deficits
* General aggressiveness and acceptance of violence
* Early sexual initiation
* Coercive sexual fantasies
* Preference for impersonal sex and sexual-risk taking
* Exposure to sexually explicit media
* Hostility towards women
* Adherence to traditional gender role norms
* Hyper-masculinity
* Suicidal behavior
* Prior sexual victimization or perpetration

The following are relationship risk factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Family environment characterized by physical violence and conflict
* Childhood history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
* Emotionally unsupportive family environment
* Poor parent-child relationships, particularly with fathers
* Association with sexually aggressive, hypermasculine, and delinquent peers
* Involvement in a violent or abusive intimate relationship

The following are community factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Poverty
* Lack of employment opportunities
* Lack of institutional support from police and judicial system
* General tolerance of sexual violence within the community
* Weak community sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators

=== Perpetrators ===
There is no stereotypical profile of sexually violent persons. Perpetrators may be coming from various backgrounds, and they may be someone known by the victim like a friend, a family member, an intimate partner, an acquaintance, or they may be a complete stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivators behind sexually violent acts are believed to be power and control, and not, as it is widely perceived, a [[sexual desire]]. Sexual violence is rather a violent, aggressive and hostile act aiming to degrade, dominate, humiliate, terrorize and control the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for committing sexual violence are that it reassures the offender about his sexual adequacy, it discharges frustration, compensates for feelings of helplessness, and achieves sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Groth AN. (2000). The rapist’s view. In: Burgess AW, ed. Violence through a forensic lens. King of Prussia, PA, Nursing Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexually violent men are somewhat limited and heavily biased towards apprehended rapists, except in the United States, where research has also been conducted on male college students. Despite the limited amount of information on sexually violent men, it appears that sexual violence is found in almost all countries (though with differences in prevalence), in all socioeconomic classes and in all age groups from childhood onwards. Data on sexually violent men also show that most direct their acts at women whom they already know.&lt;ref&gt;Heise L, Moore K, Toubia N. Sexual coercion and women's reproductive health: a focus on research. New York, NY, Population Council, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Violence against women: a priority health issue. Geneva, World Health Organization, 1997 (document WHO/FRH/WHD/97.8).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the factors increasing the risk of a man committing rape are those related to attitudes and beliefs, as well as behavior arising from situations and social conditions that provide opportunities and support for abuse.

==Consequences==
Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and it has both short and long term negative physical and psychological effects on health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|loc=Chapter 2: "Sexual violence: prevalence, dynamics and consequences".}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that male and female victims of sexual violence may experience similar mental health, behavioral and social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Patel V, Andrew G. (2001) Gender, sexual abuse and risk behaviours in adolescents: a cross-sectional survey in schools in Goa. National Medical Journal of India, 14(5):263–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dube SR et al.

In: Ezzati M, et al., eds. Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Watts, Hossain, and Zimmerman (2013) reported that 72.4% of the victims had at least one gynecological complaint. 52.2% suffered from chronic lower abdominal pain, 27.4% from abnormal vaginal bleeding, 26.6% from infertility, 25.3% from genital sores, and 22.5% from swellings in the abdomen. 18.7% of the participants also suffered from severe psychological and surgical morbidity including alcoholism. 69.4% showed significant psychological distress, 15.8% attempted suicide, 75.6% had at least one surgical complaint. 4.8% of the participants had a positive HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, C, M. Hossain, C. Zimmerman (2013). In War and Sexual Violence - Mental Health Care for Survivors. The New England Journal of Medicine, 368 (23); 2152-2153&lt;/ref&gt; In child sexual abuse (CSA) cases, the child may suffer mental health disorders that can extend into adult life especially if sexual abuse involved actual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas S., Bebbington P., McMans S., Meltzer H., Jenkins R., Kuipers E., Cooper C., King M., Brugha T.

In addition to the above-mentioned outcomes, in some cases victims of sexual violence may also be stigmatized and ostracized by their families and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mollica RF, Son L. Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 1989, 12:363–379.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal perceptions that the victim provoked sexual violence lead to a lack of disclosure of sexual assault which is associated with even more severe psychological consequences, particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero K.J., Smith D.W., Hanson R.F., Resnick H.S., Saunders B.E., Kilpatrick D.G., Best C.L.

Child Maltreat. 9(1):62-77&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, more interventions are needed in order to order to change societal attitudes towards sexual violence as well as efforts designed to educate those to whom the survivors may disclose the assault.&lt;ref&gt;McNally R.J., Bryant R.A., &amp; Ehlers A.

==Treatment==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{main| Initiatives to prevent sexual violence}}
The number of initiatives addressing sexual violence is limited and few have been evaluated. The approaches vary with most interventions being developed and implemented in industrialized countries. How relevant they may be in other settings is not well known. Early interventions and the provision of psychological support may prevent or minimize many of the harmful and lasting psychological impacts of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Astbury J, and Jewkes R. (in press) Sexual Violence: A Priority Research Area for Women’s Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foa E.B., Davidson J.R.T., Frances A., &amp; Ross R.

(2007) Randomized Controlled Evaluation of an Early Intervention to Prevent Post-Rape Psychopathology. Behav Res Ther. 45(10): 2432-2447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interventions that have been developed can be categorized as follows.

There is also a public health approach to prevention. Because sexual violence is widespread and directly or indirectly affects a community as whole, a community-oriented approach encourages not just victims and advocates to spread awareness and prevent sexual violence, but allocates responsibility to wider community to do so as well. The CDC's report on Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/svprevention-a.pdf|title=Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests following its four step model.

# Define the Problem: Collect data about the victims, perpetrators, where it's occurring, and how often it's happening. 
# Identify Risk and Protective Factors: Research the risk factors that may put people at risk for victimization of perpetration 
# Develop and Test Prevention Strategies: Work with community leaders, practitioners to test different sexual violence prevention strategies 
# Ensure Widespread Adoption: Implement and spread awareness about the successful prevention strategies

Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long &lt;ref name="Babatsikos"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Babatsikos | first=Georgia | title=Parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices about preventing child sexual abuse: a literature review | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1102 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hébert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hébert | first=Martine | last2=Lavoie | first2=Francine | last3=Parent | first3=Nathalie | title=An Assessment of Outcomes Following Parents' Participation in a Child Abuse Prevention Program | journal=Violence and Victims | volume=17 | issue=3 | date=2002-06-01 | issn=0886-6708 | doi=10.1891/vivi.17.3.355.33664 | pages=355–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Moreno Kenny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Moreno | first2=Tasha | last3=Kenny | first3=Maureen C. | title=Evaluation of a Sexual Abuse Prevention Workshop for Parents of Young Children | journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma | volume=1 | issue=4 | year=2008 | issn=1936-1521 | doi=10.1080/19361520802505768 | pages=331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Kenny 2010 pp. 130–152"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Kenny | first2=Maureen C. | title=Partnering with parents to prevent childhood sexual abuse | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1112 | pages=130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018FourStepsToThePreventionOfCSAInTheHome.pdf?CookieCheck=43313.725224213&amp;filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4FA52BE735F27D92CBFED7FA6CFFA88BC073F0228EAA69F4D1FE158D846D5D4DD33F8F3466703AC49AD67CE927D87622D067280EF2A231A479B85D0572EF2AABC4480&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Four Steps to the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the Home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018WorkingWithACommunityToPreventCSAInTheHome.pdf?filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4EB52B96A653DDB0BA5CD78B3E4F0B5A317270E32E79B9F7322E26DEE69E8F9DA1AD4D57D6203CA56A4641A004820ECE9E3EB4F712C3FED9F46CEBCE377C14C55CB2FBCFD7942&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Working with a community to prevent child sexual abuse in the home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.

==Statistics==
{{main| Estimates of sexual violence}}

Sexual violence is a widely underreported phenomenon, therefore available statistics are unlikely to inform about the true scale of the problem. The available data are scanty and fragmented. Police data, for instance, are often incomplete and limited. Data from medico-legal clinics, on the other hand, may be biased towards the more violent incidents of sexual abuse. In addition, the proportion of people who seek medical services for immediate problems related to sexual violence is also relatively small.

Reasons for non-reporting include shame and embarrassment, fear of not being believed, fear of the perpetrator of the crime, fear of the legal process, or disbelief that the police would be able to do anything to help them.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (1996) Women's Safety Australia 1996, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; Men are even more reluctant to report sexual violence due to extreme embarrassment and concerns about opinions of other people, their masculinity and the fact that they were unable to prevent the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus information about the extent of sexual violence against males is especially limited. Child sexual abuse is also largely underreported. Most of the data comes from asking adults about their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews G, Corry J, Slade T, Issakidis C, and Swanston H. (2004) Comparative risk assessment: child sexual abuse. Final report. Geneva, World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Table.GIF|600px|right|How rape statistics are formulated and how they correspond to the extent of the problem:]]One of the reasons for non-reporting is that children lack independent access to resources. They normally require the cooperation of one of their parents who may refuse to believe their child, or may, in fact, be the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;Cook B, David F, Grant A. (2001) Sexual Violence in Australia. Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series No. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexual violence typically come from police, clinical settings, [[nongovernmental organizations]] and [[survey research]]. The relationship between these sources and the global magnitude of the problem of sexual violence may be viewed as corresponding to an [[iceberg]] floating in water (see diagram).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt; The small visible tip represents cases reported to police. A larger section may be elucidated through survey research and the work of nongovernmental organizations.

== Culture ==

It has been reported that victims who attempt resistance or escape from the situation are more likely to be brutalized by the offender,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777345/#ref32 32] thereby giving an inflated sense of power to the abuser as was seen in the New Delhi gang rape case of ''Nirbhaya'' in December 2012. It is likely that in patriarchal cultures, any resistance from the woman victim is perceived by the offender as an insult to his “manhood” further provoking him to resort to more violent means to control the victim.

There is a theory that explains sexual violence as socioculturally constructed which disproves the biological framework that suggests sexual violence is a result of a man's sexual urges. This theory looks to prove that sexual violence is a natural behavior that originates from the "biological propensity to reproduce have a net positive effect on the person's (resorting to sexual violence) reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalra|first=Gurvinder|last2=Bhugra|first2=Dinesh|date=2013-07-01|title=Sexual violence against women: Understanding cross-cultural intersections|url=http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2013/55/3/244/117139|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=244–9|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117139|pmc=3777345|pmid=24082244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural theory takes into account gender power equations, moral values, male dominance, and attitudes toward violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|date=1981-10-01|title=The Socio-Cultural Context of Rape: A Cross-Cultural Study|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=5–27|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1981.tb01068.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and sexual violence ==

Feminist scholars and activists have made unique contributions to the discourse on sexual violence against women and men
. They have proposed that the root causes of sexual violence lie in the social structure characterized by severe inequality, in which the male is dominant and the female exploited. Feminists also hold that the weak institutional arrangements in place to address consequences of sexual violence, as well as unfair treatment of the victims (or survivors, an alternatively proposed terminology) are direct reflections of the ways in which society regards men, women and the sexual relations between them. Furthermore, feminist critique has led to a closer convergence between feminism and psychology in the study of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, C. A. (1995). Attitudes toward rape: Feminist and social psychological perspectives (Vol. 8). Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conveying a connection between gender-based sexual violence and concepts of power-seeking and subordination was pioneered in the 1970s and has proven to be very influential. Within this context, rape has been assessed as a foremost tool of intimidation used by men against women.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Against our will: men, women and rape. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, domestic violence can be viewed as a particularly severe form of patriarchal domination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Dobash, R. E., &amp; Dobash, R. (1979). Violence against wives: A case against the patriarchy (pp. 179-206). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist views on pornography|Feminist interpretation of pornography]] also suggests a link between rape and pornography, by which pornography that degrades, humiliates and exercises violence upon the female body feeds a culture which a culture which validates this kinds of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Let's put pornography back in the closet. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/antiporno.html.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is little evidence to prove this.

An intersection of Marxist and feminist theories has been utilized to offer additional insight to the topic of sexual violence.  According to this argument, labor and sex are analogous in the roles they play in their respective overarching exploitative systems: both are produced by the exploited person and both are forcefully taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, C. A. (1982). Feminism, Marxism, method, and the state: An agenda for theory. Signs, 7(3), 515-544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist scholars have illuminated the idea that all women cannot have uniformly similar experiences of sexual violence or its aftermath. For instance race and ethnicity are significant determinants of these experiences, which serves to show that approaches which are exclusively feminist or exclusively anti-racist in nature are misguided. Instead, a proposition has been made for use of inter-sectionality when studying these cases.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color. Stanford law review, 1241-1299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist ideas have served as catalysts for transnational movements to combat violence against women, including sexual violence. This agenda has also been adopted by feminist organizations, as illustrated by the current initiative titled the Rape Task Force of the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]].

== International legal framework ==
{{Main|International framework of sexual violence}}
[[International humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"/&gt; IHL ensures women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs when they are more vulnerable, such as widows, the sick and wounded, migrants, the internally displaced, or those held in detention.&lt;ref name="Customary IHL. Rule 134 on Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary IHL.

Groundbreaking [[case law]] both by the ''ad hoc'' Tribunals of [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) established acts of [[war rape|rape]] and sexual violence as [[Genocide#As a crime|crimes of genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2001|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

An extensive amount of both [[Hard law|hard]] and [[soft law]] instruments set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences. These include the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), art. 6 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article6 |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] (1993); the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/brazil1994.html|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]] (2003), and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (1993).

==History==

===General===
Sexual violence can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans where women were seen as property without any rights over their bodies or sexual integrity. Rape of women during peace times was therefore considered as property crime only affecting their owners: the husbands, sons or brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herik|first=edited by Anne-Marie De Brouwer, Charlotte Ku, Renée Römkens, Larissa van den|title=Sexual violence as an international crime : interdisciplinary approaches|year=1120|publisher=Intersentia|location=Cambridge [etc.]|isbn=978-1-78068-002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During armed conflict sexual violence, particularly rape, was perceived as a normal byproduct of war, as "a socially acceptable behavior well within the rules of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|title=Against our will : men, women, and rape|year=1993|publisher=Fawcett Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-90820-4|edition=1st Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, women were sometimes the reason for the attack of a city, conquering women as new wives or concubines, legitimate booty, as slaves or as trophies. The fact that sexual violence to women was commonplace during both war and peace times led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was; it was face- and nameless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The [[Middle Ages]] strongly reflected the patriarchal sexual violence view. During times of peace, female spouses had no right to refuse sex with their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Cruze|first=Shani|title=Approaching the History of Rape and Sexual Violence: Notes towards Research|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|year=2011|volume=1|issue=3|page=382|doi=10.1080/09612029300200016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though laws punishing rapes existed, sexual violence was usually considered as justified or inconsequential. Usually, depending on the elite's views, which perceived sexual violence as a minor issue, sexual violence was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggiero|first=Guido|title=Sexual Criminality in the Early Renaissance: Venice 1338-1358|journal=Journal of Social History|year=1975|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also transferred to the colonies. In Alta California, for example, the Catholic clergy relied heavily on corporal punishment such as flogging, placing in the stocks or shackling of Amerinindian women within their programs of Christianization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context of trying to restore a certain social order, women were often the victims of sexual violence if politically active and posing a threat to the existing order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to times of war, jurists, writers and scholars argued that as soon as war is just, no boundaries would be set towards methods used in order to achieve victory. However, with [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) discussions started that suffering of women should be reduced and rape prohibited during peace and war times. However, this view was not accepted for a long time, as women and children not participating in the fighting were still considered as being the enemy and the patriarchal view on women prevailed during peace and war times.

===Codification of laws of war on gender-related crimes===
Gradually, over the centuries laws and customs of war changed in direction of a wider understanding of sexual violence and the need to protect the victims. During the American civil war, the US started to codify the customary rules regulating land-based wars. With the [[Lieber Code]] of 1863, President Lincoln tried to regulate the conduct of Union soldiers and prohibited explicitly rape.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Peggy|title=Prosecuting Crimes of Sexual Violence in an International Tribunal|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|year=2002|volume=34|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Geneva Convention|first-ever Geneva Convention]] one year after and the Fourth [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] 1907 followed this line by advocating the protection of family rights and honor, implying specifically also the prohibition of rape. But the only enforcement mechanisms were the military commanders themselves, having the right to execute the soldiers immediately.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"/&gt;

After [[World War I]], a War Crimes Commission was established in order to bring war criminals before justice. Forced prostitution and rape was seen as grave violation of the customs and laws of war. Under the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (IMT) and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East at Tokyo (IMTFE), the spectrum of sexual violence as war crime was widened even though rape was not explicitly mentioned. The transcripts of the trials contain evidence of rape, sexual slavery, sexual torture, forced prostitution, forced sterilization, forced abortion, pornography, sexual mutilation, forced nudity and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sexual sadism]]. But only after the Tokyo Tribunal, when Japanese commanders were prosecuted the first time based on the chain of command for not having prevented rape and sexual slavery of [[comfort women]] during the Second World War, was sexual violence gradually considered as a grave war crime in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argibay|first=Carmen M.|title=Sexual Slavery and the "Comfort Women" of World War II|journal=Berkeley Journal of International Law|year=2003|volume=21|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was the first time expressed after Nuremberg and Tokyo in the second series of trials for the prosecution of "lesser" war criminals where the Control Council Law No. 10 explicitly listed rape constituting a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control Council Law No. 10|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp|publisher=Yale Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">The use of '''space mirrors as an anti-global warming measure''' is a proposed technology for climate change mitigation by deflection of sunlight.  It was one of a series of proposals for controlling [[global warming]] made to the [[United States]] government in 2001.

At the "Response Options to Rapid or Severe Climate Change" round-table meeting organized by the President's [[U.S. Climate Change Technology Program|Climate Change Technology Program]] in September 2001 to gather ideas for averting climate change, one of the proposals was to station one or more wire-mesh "mirrors" in orbit to deflect sunlight back into space or to filter it. The idea was proposed by [[Lowell Wood]], a senior staff scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], who calculated that deflecting 1% of sunlight would restore climatic stability, and that that would require either a single mirror {{convert|600000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in area or several smaller ones. Wood had been researching the idea for more than ten years but considered it so infeasible that it should only be a back-up plan for solving the global warming problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2005-06/how-earth-scale-engineering-can-save-planet "How Earth-Scale Engineering Can Save the Planet,"] ''[[Popular Science]]'' June 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the US government was recommending that research on sunlight deflection, including space mirrors, be continued as "insurance" and that the next [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|United Nations Report on Climate Change]] advocate such a strategy.&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;David Adam, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/27/usnews.frontpagenews "US answer to global warming: smoke and giant space mirrors,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'' January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/01/26/USGReview_pp6_7.pdf U.S. Government Review of the Second Order Draft of WGIII Contribution "Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change,"] pdf at ''The Guardian''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s website: "Modifying solar radiance may be an important strategy if mitigation of emissions fails for one reason or another."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the space mirror, suggested sunlight-reducing techniques included launching thousands of highly reflective balloons and pumping sulphate droplets into the upper atmosphere to emulate volcanic emissions.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRev&gt;Mark Williams, [http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/18175/ "Cooling the Planet,"] ''[[Technology Review]]'' February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Space mirrors were first considered in the 1980s as a way to cool the climate of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]]. [[James Early]], also at Livermore, in 1989 proposed using a "space shade" 2,000 kilometers in diameter orbiting at [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian Point L1]]. He estimated the cost at between one and ten trillion [[US dollars]] and suggested manufacturing it on the moon using moon rock.&lt;ref name=TRev/&gt; 

Using space mirrors as a [[space sunshade]] to reduce the impact of sunlight falls into the category of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]]: deliberately modifying the earth's climate. At a conference on the topic organized by [[Daniel P. Schrag|Daniel Schrag]] of [[Harvard University]]  and [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]] of the [[University of Calgary]] in November 2007, the consensus was that it was worth studying such ideas further despite their high cost, the doubtful feasibility of some including the space mirror, and the risk of their distracting attention from [[Emissions_reduction|reduction]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin LaMonica, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9819173-54.html "'Geoengineering': Space mirror over Greenland?,"] [[CNET.com]] - Greentech News November 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eli Kintisch]], [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/11/giving-climate-change-kick "Giving Climate Change a Kick,"] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">The '''space of flows''' is a high-level cultural abstraction of [[space]] and [[time]], and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician [[Manuel Castells]] to "reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm"; a new type of space that allows distant synchronous, real-time interaction (Castells, p.&amp;nbsp;146). The space of flows first was mentioned in ''The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process'' (1989).

==Definitions==
Castells defines the concepts as follows: "The material arrangements that allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity. It is not purely electronic space...It is made up first of all of an technological infrastructure of information systems, telecommunications, and transportation lines" (Castells, Manuel (2000): Grassrooting the Space of Flows, hg. von. James O. Wheeler, Yuko Aoyama und Barney Warf, London: Routledge, p.19).

==Theoretic==
Traditionally, the concept of space is considered a passive entity, while time is considered a separate and active entity. Space should not be disconnected from time, because space is a dynamic entity related to time. Castells rejected the contention that space will disappear upon the creation of the [[global city]], because space is "the material support of time-sharing social practices". Thus, the ''space of flows'' is "the material organization of time-sharing social practices that work through flows" (Castells, p.&amp;nbsp;147).

In 2001, Castells wrote: "the space of flows ... links up distant locales around shared functions and meanings on the basis of electronic circuits and fast transportation corridors, while isolating and subduing the logic of experience embodied in the space of places" ("Informationalism and the Network Society" in ''The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age'' (2001), by Pekka Himanen, New York, Random House pp.&amp;nbsp;155–78).

==Practical==
[[Space]] is the physical support of the way people live in [[time]]. ''Real world time'', the space-and-time to which people are accustomed, is the "space of places", which is unlike the "space of flows" because it lacks the three elements of (i) a proper flow medium, (ii) the proper items composing the flow traversing through it, and (iii) the organisational nodes through which these flows circulate (Stalder, p.&amp;nbsp;3). The space of flows concept comprehends human action and interaction occurring dynamically and at a distance—effected via telecommunications technology containing continuous flows of time-sensitive communications, and the nodes of global [[computer]] systems. These informational flows connect people to a continuous, real-time [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] community that differs from the [[Global village (term)|global village]] because the groups' positions in time become more important than their places.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8647">'''Specification and Description Language''' ('''SDL''') is a [[specification language]] targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.

== Overview ==
The [[ITU-T]] has defined SDL in Recommendations Z.100 to Z.106. SDL originally focused on telecommunication systems; {{as of | 2016}} its current areas of application include process control and real-time applications in general. Due to its nature it can be used to represent simulation systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title= Definition of Virtual Reality Simulation Models Using Specification and Description Language Diagrams

| author= Fonseca i Casas, Pau and Pi, Xavier and Casanovas, Josep and Jové, Jordi 
| accessdate= 2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; without ambiguity and with a graphical notation.

The Specification and Description Language provides both a graphical ''Graphic Representation'' (SDL/GR) as well as a textual ''Phrase Representation'' (SDL/PR), which are both equivalent representations of the same underlying semantics. Models are usually shown in the graphical SDL/GR form, and SDL/PR is mainly used for exchanging models between tools. A system is specified as a set of interconnected abstract machines which are extensions of [[finite state machine]]s (FSM).

The language is [[Turing completeness|formally complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71289-3_17

| accessdate= 2014-08-27
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
so it can be used for code generation for either simulation or final targets.

The Specification and Description Language covers five main aspects: structure, communication, behavior, data, and inheritance.  The behavior of components is explained by partitioning the system into a series of hierarchies. Communication between the components takes place through gates connected by channels. The channels are of delayed channel type, so communication is usually asynchronous, but when the delay is set to zero (that is, no delay) the communication becomes synchronous.

The first version of the language was released in 1976 using graphical syntax (SDL-76). This was revised in 1980 with some rudimentary semantics (SDL-80). The semantics were refined in 1984 (SDL-84), the textual form was introduced for machine processing and data was introduced. In 1988, SDL-88 was released with a formal basis for the language: an abstract grammar as well as a concrete grammar and a full formal definition. The version released in 1992 (SDL-92) introduced object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstract generic types etc., with the object-oriented features described by transformations into non-object oriented ones. SDL-2010 is the latest version, an updated version of SDL-2000 that was completely based on object-orientation, rather than description by transformations. This version is accompanied by a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-Profile: ITU-T Recommendation Z.109 (04/12), SDL-2010 combined with UML. SDL-2010 also introduced the support of C data types as initially introduced by SDL-RT.

== Organization ==

=== Hierarchy level ===
The Hierarchy level of SDL is structured as follows. 
*Library package
*System agent
*Block agent
*Process agent
*Procedure type
*Remote procedure

=== Architecture ===
An SDL system is made of functional blocks and each block can be further decomposed in sub-blocks. The lowest level block is composed of one or several process described as finite state machines.

[[Image:SdlArchitecture.JPG]]

=== Communication ===
Blocks are connected through channels that carry the messages (or signals) exchanged between the blocks. A block agent consists of process agents.

[[Image:SdlChannels.png]]

=== Behavior ===
Each process agent is a state machine that contributes to the action carried out by the system. A message stimulus coming from the environment or from another agent to an agent is called a signal. Signals received by a process agent are first placed in a queue (the input port). When the state machine is waiting in a state, if the first signal in the input port is enabled for that state it starts a transition leading to another state. Transitions can output signals to other agents or to the environment. A process agent is allowed to contain procedure types so that the same actions can be invoked from different places. It is also allowed to call a remote procedure type to invoke a procedure in another agent (or even another system) and wait for a response.

[[Image:SdlStateMachine.png]]

In this example MyVariable is of type INTEGER and is the only variable in the process. The first transition is the ''start'' transition that initializes the local variable. A connection request message ''conReq'' is sent, a 5 seconds timer ''conReqTimer'' is started, and the state machine goes to the ''connecting'' state. In the ''connecting'' state if the timer goes off -that is equivalent to a message receive- the connection request is sent again up to 10 times. If a connection confirmation is received the state machine goes to ''connected'' state. This is a typical telecommunication protocol scenario.

Available symbols are:

[[Image:SdlSymbols.jpg]]

=== Data ===
SDL Abstract Data Types (ADT) support basic data types such as INTEGER, REAL, CHARSTRING as well as structured ones such as structures (STRUCT), enumerated (LITERALS), constants (SYNONYMS). Syntax looks like the one from Pascal, for example an assignment is written ':='.

== SDL tools ==
The most well-known SDL modelling tools are Telelogic Tau, PragmaDev Studio, Cinderella, Safire-SDL, and ObjectGeode (now out of the market). PragmaDev Studio supports both SDL and SDL-RT which is used to develop real-time and embedded software. There are also some open source projects relative to SDL modeling like JADE which is a Java-based specification environment, and OpenGEODE, a Python/Qt implementation of an SDL editor from the European Space Agency.

In [[Electronics|electronic]] [[instrumentation]] and [[signal processing]], a '''time to digital converter''' (abbreviated '''TDC''') is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the [[time]] they occurred. For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time.

In [[electronics]] '''time-to-digital converters''' (TDCs) or '''time digitizers''' are devices commonly used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases &lt;ref name=Kalisz&gt;{{Citation |title=Review of methods for time interval measurements with picosecond resolution |first=Józef |last=Kalisz |journal=Metrologia |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= 17–32 |date=February 2004 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/41/1/004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Interpolation|interpolating]] TDCs are also called '''time counters''' (TCs).

TDCs are used in many different applications, where the time interval between two signal pulses (start and stop pulse) should be determined. Measurement is started and stopped, when either the rising or the falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. These requirements are fulfilled in many physical experiments, like [[time-of-flight]] and lifetime measurements in [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[particle physics|high energy physics]], experiments that involve [[laser rangefinder|laser ranging]] and electronic research involving the testing of [[integrated circuits]] and high-speed data transfer.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;

==Application==
TDCs are used in applications where measurement events happen infrequently, such as [[high energy physics]] [[experiment]]s, where the sheer number of data [[channel (communications)|channels]] in most detectors ensures that each channel will be excited only infrequently by particles such as electrons, photons, and ions.

==Coarse measurement==
[[File:CMOS TW OSC 000.png|thumb|right|A CMOS (rotary) traveling wave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] or [[Digital delay line|delay line]] or [[distributed amplifier]] runs at a flip-flop compatible frequency, but has sharper edges and sub-edge resolution]]

If the required time resolution is not high, then counters can be used to make the conversion.

===Basic counter===
&lt;!-- this is a straight time measurement; capture count; no start signal --&gt;

In its simplest implementation, a TDC is simply a high-[[frequency]] [[Counter (digital)|counter]] that increments every clock cycle. The current contents of the counter represents the current time. When an event occurs, the counter's value is captured in an output register.

In that approach, the measurement is an integer number of clock cycles, so the measurement is quantized to a clock period. To get finer resolution, a faster clock is needed. The accuracy of the measurement depends upon the stability of the clock frequency.

Typically a TDC uses a [[crystal oscillator]] reference frequency for good long term stability. High stability crystal oscillators are usually relative low frequency such as 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (or 100&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).&lt;ref&gt;For example, a Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) 10811 crystal oven oscillator; http://www.hparchive.com/Manuals/HP-10811AB-Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To get better resolution, a [[phase-locked loop]] frequency multiplier can be used to generate a faster clock. One might, for example, multiply the crystal reference oscillator by 100 to get a clock rate of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz (1&amp;nbsp;ns resolution).

====Counter technology====
High clock rates impose additional design constraints on the counter: if the clock period is short, it is difficult to update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A [[Ring counter|Johnson counter]], for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a [[prescaler]].

The speed of counters fabricated in [[CMOS]]-technology is limited by the capacitance between the gate and the channel and by the resistance of the channel and the signal traces. The product of both is the cut-off-frequency. Modern chip technology allows multiple metal layers and therefore coils with a large number of windings to be inserted into the chip.
This allows designers to peak the device for a specific [[frequency]], which may lie above the cut-off-frequency of the original transistor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A peaked variant of the Johnson counter is the [[distributed amplifier|traveling-wave]] counter which also achieves sub-cycle resolution. Other methods to achieve sub-cycle resolution include [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[Vernier scale|vernier]] [[Counter (digital)|Johnson counters]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Measuring a time interval====
[[File:CoarseCounting.png|thumb|sketch of the coarse counting method in TDCs: showing measurements of T in various relations to the clock pulses]]

In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an arbitrary time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, the time between a start event and a stop event.

That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts.

The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event.

'''Coarse counters''' base on a [[clock signal|reference clock]] with signals generated at a stable [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; When the start signal is detected the [[Counter (digital)|counter]] starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; between start and stop is then

:&lt;math&gt; T = n\cdot T_0 &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of counts and &lt;math&gt;T_0 = 1/f_0&lt;/math&gt;, the period of the [[clock signal|reference clock]].

===Statistical counter===
Since start, stop and [[clock signal]] are asynchronous, there is a uniform [[probability distribution]] of the start and stop signal-times between two subsequent clock pulses. This detuning of the start and stop signal from the clock pulses is called [[quantization error]].

For a series of measurements on the same constant and asynchronous time interval one measures two different numbers of counted clock pulses &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; (see picture). These occur with [[probabilities]]

:&lt;math&gt; p(n_1) = 1 - c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q(n_2) = c&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;c = Frc(T/T_0)&lt;/math&gt; the [[fractional part]] of &lt;math&gt;T/T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The value for the time interval is then obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;T = (p\cdot n_1 + q\cdot n_2)\cdot T_0&lt;/math&gt;

Measuring a time interval using a coarse counter with the averaging method described above is relatively time consuming because of the many repetitions that are needed to determine the probabilities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. In comparison to the other methods described later on, a coarse counter has a very limited resolution (1ns in case of a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[clock signal|reference clock]]), but satisfies with its theoretically unlimited measuring range.

==Fine measurement==

In contrast to the coarse counter in the previous section, fine measurement methods with much better accuracy but far smaller measuring range are presented here.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt; [[analog signal|Analogue]] methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as [[Digital data|digital]] methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the [[analog signal|analogue]] methods still obtain better accuracies, [[Digital data|digital]] time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in [[integrated circuit]] technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes.

The counter implementation's accuracy is limited by the clock frequency. If time is measured by whole counts, then the resolution is limited to the clock period. For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz clock has a resolution of 100&amp;nbsp;ns. To get resolution finer than a clock period, there are time interpolation circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time and Frequency from A to Z |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |year= |url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-ti.htm |quote=For example, multiplying the time base frequency to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz makes 10&amp;nbsp;ns resolution possible, and 1&amp;nbsp;ns counters have even been built using a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz time base. However, a more common way to increase resolution is to detect parts of a time base cycle through interpolation and not be limited by the number of whole cycles. Interpolation has made 1&amp;nbsp;ns TICs commonplace, and even 20&amp;nbsp;picosecond TICs are available. |doi= }}, entry for ''time interval counter''.&lt;/ref&gt; These circuits measure the fraction of a clock period: that is, the time between a clock event and the event being measured. The interpolation circuits often require a significant amount of time to perform their function; consequently, the TDC needs a quiet interval before the next measurement.

===Ramp interpolator===

When counting is not feasible because the clock rate would be too high, analog methods can be used. Analog methods are often used to measure intervals that are between 10 and 200&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods often use a capacitor that is charged during the interval being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Reeser |first=Gilbert A. |title=An Electronic Counter for the 1970's |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=May 1969 |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=9&amp;ndash;12 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1969-05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasaki"&gt;{{Citation |first=Gary D. |last=Sasaki |first2=Ronald C. |last2=Jensen |title=Automatic Measurements with a High Performance Universal Counter |date=September 1980 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1980-09.pdf |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=21&amp;ndash;31 |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Rush |first=Kenneth |last2=Oldfield |first2=Danny J. |title=A Data Acquisition System for a 1-GHz Digitizing Oscilloscope |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=April 1986 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=4&amp;ndash;11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Eskeldson |first=David D. |last2=Kellum |first2=Reginald |last3=Whiteman |first3=Donald A. |title=A Digitizing Oscilloscope Time Base and Trigger System Optimized for Throughput and Low Jitter |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |date=October 1993 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=21&amp;ndash;30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the capacitor is discharged to zero volts. When the start event occurs, the capacitor is charged with a constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; the constant current causes the voltage ''v'' on the capacitor to increase linearly with time. The rising voltage is called the fast ramp. When the stop event occurs, the charging current is stopped. The voltage on the capacitor ''v'' is directly proportional to the time interval ''T'' and can be measured with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC). The resolution of such a system is in the range of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalisz|2004|p=20}}. Kalisz states that the [[Stanford Research Systems]] SR620 uses this method.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a separate ADC can be used, the ADC step is often integrated into the interpolator. A second constant current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to discharge the capacitor at a constant but much slower rate (the slow ramp). The slow ramp might be 1/1000 of the fast ramp. This discharge effectively "stretches" the time interval;&lt;ref name="Esk p27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}} stating, "Effectively, the interpolator magnifies the interpolation or uncertainty interval by the ratio of the charge and discharge currents."&lt;/ref&gt; it will take 1000 times as long for the capacitor to discharge to zero volts. The stretched interval can be measured with a counter. The measurement is similar to a [[Integrating ADC|dual-slope analog converter]].

The dual-slope conversion can take a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;ps with a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz (10&amp;nbsp;ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a conversion time of 150&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;s.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; To decrease the conversion time, the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a '''residual interpolator technique'''.&lt;ref name="Esk p27"/&gt; The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.

Interpolators are often used with a stable system clock. The start event is asynchronous, but the stop event is a following clock.&lt;ref name="Sasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"/&gt;  For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1&amp;nbsp;volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the start event occurs at 67.3&amp;nbsp;ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous start event is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to .327&amp;nbsp;V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327&amp;nbsp;V and the synchronizer reports the start event has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output can be used to capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7&amp;nbsp;ns before the synchronizer reported.

The interpolator is actually more involved because there are synchronizer issues and current switching is not instantaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eskeldson|Kellum|Whiteman|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the interpolator must calibrate the height of the ramp to a clock period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sasaki|Jensen|1980|p=23}} stating, "In practice, the current sources and other circuitry used to build the interpolators are subject to operational variations over temperature and time. The 5360A's interpolators were in a special insulated cavity and had several adjustments. The 5335A uses a self-calibration technique that is not affected by temperature and needs no adjustments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernier===
&lt;!-- these need to be merged --&gt;

====Vernier interpolator====
The vernier method is more involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |last2=Allen |first2=Mark S. |last3=Foster |first3=Allen S. |title=Universal Counter Resolves Picoseconds in Time Interval Measurements |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2&amp;ndash;11 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves a triggerable oscillator&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chu |first1=David C. |title=The Triggered Phase-Locked Oscillator |date=August 1978 |journal=HP Journal |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=8&amp;ndash;9 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf |issn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator has a slightly different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1&amp;nbsp;ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67&amp;nbsp;ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66&amp;nbsp;ns after the next clock, at 65&amp;nbsp;ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time that needs to be added.

The interpolator design is more involved. The triggerable clock must be calibrated to clock. It must also start quickly and cleanly.

====Vernier method====
&lt;!-- this uses two startable oscillators; most implementations will use a stable clock and a startable oscillator --&gt;

The '''Vernier method''' is a [[Digital data|digital]] version of the time stretching method. Two only slightly detuned [[oscillation|oscillators]] (with [[frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;) start their signals with the arrival of the start and the stop signal. As soon as the leading edges of the [[oscillation|oscillator]] signals coincide the measurement ends and the number of periods of the oscillators (&lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively) lead to the original time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{n_1-1}{f_1} - \frac{n_2-1}{f_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since highly reliable [[oscillation|oscillators]] with stable and accurate [[frequency]] are still quite a challenge one also realizes the vernier method via two tapped delay lines using two slightly different cell delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This setting is called '''differential delay line''' or '''vernier delay line'''.

In the example presented here the first delay line affiliated with the start signal contains cells of D-[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by &lt;math&gt;\tau_L&lt;/math&gt; and the state of the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of [[operational amplifier#Applications|non-inverting buffers]] with delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_B &lt; \tau_L&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;T = n\cdot (\tau_1 - \tau_2)&lt;/math&gt;

with n the number of cells marked as transparent.

===Tapped delay line===
[[File:TapDelayLine.png|thumb|circuit diagram of a tapped delay line]]

In general a '''tapped delay line''' contains a number of cells with well defined delay times &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Propagating through this line the start signal is delayed. The state of the line is sampled at the time of the arrival of the stop signal.
This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip-flop cells with a delay time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The start signal propagates through this line of transparent [[flip-flops]] and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The stop signal latches all [[flip-flops]] while propagating through its channel undelayed and the start signal cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of [[flip-flops]] that were sampled as transparent.

==Hybrid measurement==
[[File:Nutt.png|thumb|Sketch of the Nutt interpolation method]]
&lt;!-- terminology clash: interpolation (used above) and interpolator = synchronizer and fine method --&gt;

Counters can measure long intervals but have limited resolution. Interpolators have high resolution but they cannot measure long intervals. A hybrid approach can achieve both long intervals and high resolution.&lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;  The long interval can be measured with a counter. The counter information is supplemented with two time interpolators: one interpolator measures the (short) interval between the start event and a following clock event, and the second interpolator measure the interval between the stop event and a following clock event. The basic idea has some complications: the start and stop events are asynchronous, and one or both might happen close to a clock pulse. The counter and interpolators must agree on matching the start and end clock events. To accomplish that goal, synchronizers are used.

The common hybrid approach is the '''Nutt method'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=Error analysis and design of the Nutt time-interval digitiser with picosecond resolution |publisher= |journal=J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum. |volume=20 |issue= |pages=1330&amp;ndash;1341 |issn= |doi= 10.1088/0022-3735/20/11/005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example the fine measurement circuit measures the time between start and stop pulse and the respective second nearest clock pulse of the coarse counter (''T''&lt;sub&gt;start&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;stop&lt;/sub&gt;), detected by the synchronizer (see figure). Thus the wanted time interval is

:&lt;math&gt;T = n T_0 + T_{\mathrm{start}} - T_{\mathrm{stop}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''n'' the number of counter clock pulses and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the period of the coarse counter.

==History==

Time measurement has played a crucial role in the understanding of nature from the earliest times. Starting with sun, sand or water driven [[clocks]] we are able to use clocks today, based on the most precise [[caesium]] resonators.

The first direct predecessor of a TDC was invented in the year 1942 by [[Bruno Rossi]] for the measurement of [[muon]] lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;"Bruno Benedetto Rossi", George W. Clark, National Academic Press, Washington D.C. 1998, S.13&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a '''time-to-amplitude-converter''', constantly charging a [[capacitor]] during the measured time interval. The corresponding [[voltage]] is directly proportional to the time interval under examination.

While the basic concepts (like Vernier methods ([[Pierre Vernier]] 1584-1638) and time stretching) of dividing time into measurable intervals are still up-to-date, the implementation changed a lot during the past 50 years. Starting with [[vacuum tubes]] and [[transformer types#RF transformers|ferrite pot-core transformers]] those ideas are implemented in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ([[CMOS]]) design today.&lt;ref&gt;"Noise Shaping Techniques for Analog and Time to Digital Converters Using Voltage Controlled Oscillators", Matthew A.Z. Straayer, Phd-Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors==
:&lt;small&gt;Some information from &lt;ref name=Kalisz /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
Regarding even the fine measuring methods presented, there are still errors one may wish remove or at least to consider. Non-linearities of the time-to-digital conversion for example can be identified by taking a large number of measurements of a [[poissonian]] distributed source (statistical code density test).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pelka |first=R. |last2=Kalisz |first2=J. |last3=Szplet |first3=R. |year=1997 |title=Nonlinearity correction of the integrated time-to-digital converter with direct coding |journal=IEEE Trans. Instrumentation and Measurement |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1109/19.571882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small deviations from the uniform distribution reveal the non-linearities.
Inconveniently the statistical code density method is quite sensitive to external temperature changes. Thus stabilizing [[delay-locked loop|delay]] or [[phase-locked loop]] (DLL or PLL) circuits are recommended.

In a similar way, offset errors (non-zero readouts at ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) can be removed.

For long time intervals, the error due to instabilities in the [[clock signal|reference clock]] ([[jitter]]) plays a major role. Thus clocks of superior quality are needed for such TDCs.

Furthermore, external noise sources can be eliminated in postprocessing by [[robust statistic|robust estimation methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kalisz |first=J. |last2=Pawlowski |first2=M. |last3=Pelka |first3=R. |date=March 1994 |title=Precision time counter for laser ranging to satellites |journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=736–741 |doi=10.1063/1.1145094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==

TDCs are currently built as stand-alone measuring devices in physical experiments or as system components like PCI cards. They can be made up of either discrete or integrated circuits.

Circuit design changes with the purpose of the TDC, which can either be a very good solution for single-shot TDCs with long dead times or some trade-off between dead-time and resolution for multi-shot TDCs.

==Delay generator==
[[File:TDC DTC 000.png|thumb|right|Similarity between a '''TDC''' (bottom) and a '''Delay Generator''' (top, but needs bottom for trigger). The strobe is gated by the oscillator to avoid a race with the carry bit]]
{{main|Digital delay generator}}

The time-to-digital converter measures the time between a start event and a stop event. There is also a '''digital-to-time converter''' or '''delay generator'''. The delay generator converts a number to a time delay. When the delay generator gets a start pulse at its input, then it outputs a stop pulse after the specified delay. The architectures for TDC and delay generators are similar. Both use counters for long, stable, delays. Both must consider the problem of clock quantization errors.

For example, the [[Tektronix]] 7D11 Digital Delay uses a counter architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay Service Instruction Manual |publisher=Tektronix |location=Beaverton, OR |id=070-1377-01 |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital delay may be set from 100&amp;nbsp;ns to 1&amp;nbsp;s in 100&amp;nbsp;ns increments. An analog circuit provides an additional fine delay of 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;ns. A 5&amp;nbsp;MHz reference clock drives a [[phase-locked loop]] to produce a stable 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and fed to main counter.&lt;ref&gt;Ten megahertz is a frequency that TTL logic in 1971 could handle. The high frequency divisions were handled with different technologies because high speed digital counters were uncommon in 1971. The first (500&amp;nbsp;MHz) divider stage is a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz synchronized [[multivibrator]] to effect a divide by 5 circuit. The second (100&amp;nbsp;MHz) stage is a divide by 5 ring counter made from discrete emitter-coupled transistors. The last stage is a flip-flop.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz clock (2&amp;nbsp;ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2&amp;nbsp;ns of [[jitter]]. The recycle time is 575&amp;nbsp;ns.

Just as a TDC may use interpolation to get finer than one clock period resolution, a delay generator may use similar techniques. The [[Hewlett-Packard]] 5359A High Resolution Time Synthesizer provides delays of 0 to 160&amp;nbsp;ms, has an accuracy of 1&amp;nbsp;ns, and achieves a typical jitter of 100&amp;nbsp;ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Time Synthesizer Generates Precise Pulse Widths and Time Delays for Critical Timing Applications |first1=Keith M. |last1=Ferguson |first2=Leonard R. |last2=Dickstein |journal=HP Journal |volume=29 |issue=12 |date=August 1978 |pages=12–19 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1978-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design uses a triggered phase-locked oscillator that runs at 200&amp;nbsp;MHz. Interpolation is done with a ramp, an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, and a comparator. The resolution is about 45&amp;nbsp;ps.

&lt;!-- stuff from earlier version --&gt;
When the start pulse is received, then [[Counter (digital)|count]]s down and outputs a stop pulse. For low [[jitter]] the [[Counter (digital)|synchronous counter]] has to feed a [[Status register|zero flag]] from the [[most significant bit]] down to the [[least significant bit]] and then combine it with the output from the Johnson counter.

A [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) could be used to achieve sub-cycle resolution, but it is easier to either use vernier Johnson counters or traveling-wave Johnson counters.

The delay generator can be used for [[pulse width modulation]], e.g. to drive a [[MOSFET]] to load a [[Pockels cell]] within 8 ns with a specific charge.

The output of a delay generator can gate a digital-to-analog converter and so pulses of a variable height can be generated. This allows matching to low levels needed by analog electronics, higher levels for [[Emitter-coupled logic|ECL]] and even higher levels for [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]]. If a series of DACs is gated in sequence, variable pulse shapes can be generated to account for any transfer function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4394">:''For a less technical introduction, see [[Utility]].''

In [[microeconomics]], the '''utility maximization problem''' is the problem [[consumer]]s face: "how should I spend my [[money]] in order to maximize my [[utility]]?" It is a type of [[Optimal decision|optimal decision problem]].

==Basic setup==
Suppose the consumer's [[consumption set]], or the enumeration of all possible consumption bundles that could be selected if there were no budget constraint, has ''L'' commodities and is limited to positive amounts of consumption of each commodity. Let ''x'' be the vector ''x''={''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;;''i''=1,...''L''} containing the amounts of each commodity; then

:&lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose also that the price vector (''p'') of the ''L'' commodities is positive,

:&lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

and that the consumer's income is &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; then the set of all affordable packages, the [[budget set]], is

:&lt;math&gt;B(p, I) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^L_+ : \langle p , x \rangle \leq I\} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle p , x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dot product]] of ''p'' and ''x'', or the total cost of consuming ''x'' of the products at price level ''p'':
:&lt;math&gt;\langle p , x \rangle=\sum_{i=1}^L p_i x_i .&lt;/math&gt;

The consumer would like to buy the best affordable package of commodities.

It is assumed that the consumer has an [[ordinal utility]] function, called ''u''. It is a real valued function with domain being the set of all commodity bundles, or

:&lt;math&gt;u : \mathbb{R}^L_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Then the consumer's optimal choice &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is the utility maximizing bundle of all bundles in the budget set, or

:&lt;math&gt;x(p,I) = \operatorname{argmax}_{x^* \in B(p,I)} u(x^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finding &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''utility maximization problem'''.

If ''u'' is continuous and no commodities are free of charge, then &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; exists,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} but it is not necessarily unique.  If there is a unique maximizer for all values of the price and wealth parameters, then &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Marshallian demand function]]; otherwise, &lt;math&gt;x(p,I)&lt;/math&gt; is set-valued and it is called the [[Marshallian demand correspondence]].

== Reaction to changes in prices ==
For a given level of real wealth, only relative prices matter to consumers, not absolute prices.  If consumers reacted to changes in nominal prices and nominal wealth even if relative prices and real wealth remained unchanged, this would be an effect called [[money illusion]].  The mathematical first order conditions for a maximum of the consumer problem guarantee that the demand for each good is homogeneous of degree zero jointly in nominal prices and nominal wealth, so there is no money illusion.

== Bounded rationality ==
In practice, a consumer may not always pick an optimal package. For example, it may require too much thought.  [[Bounded rationality]] is a theory that explains this behaviour with [[satisficing]]&amp;mdash;picking packages that are suboptimal but good enough.

== Related concepts ==
The relationship between the [[utility function]] and [[Marshallian demand]] in the utility maximization problem mirrors the relationship between the [[expenditure function]] and [[Hicksian demand]] in the [[expenditure minimization problem]].

'''Water cure''' is a form of [[torture]] in which the victim is forced to drink large quantities of water in a short time, resulting in [[gastric distension]], [[water intoxication]], and possibly [[death]].&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Korry2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeller2007 /&gt;

Often the victim has the [[Human mouth|mouth]] forced or wedged open, the [[Human nose|nose]] closed with pincers and a [[funnel]] or strip of cloth forced down the throat. The victim has to drink all the [[water]] (or other [[liquid]]s such as bile or urine) poured into the funnel to avoid [[drowning]]. The stomach fills until near bursting and is sometimes beaten until the victim [[vomiting|vomits]] and the torture begins again.

While this use of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century,&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; the first use of the phrase '''water cure''' in this sense is indirectly dated to around 1898, by [[U.S. Army|U.S. soldiers]] in the [[Spanish–American War]],&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;{{efn|The late 19th century expropriation of the term ''water cure'', already in use in the therapeutic sense, to denote the polar opposite of therapy, namely torture, has the hallmark of arising in the sense of irony.

== Historical uses ==

=== East-Indies ===
The use of the water cure by the Dutch in the East-Indies is documented by the English merchants of the East India Company after the [[Amboyna massacre]] in February 1623 (stilo veteri). The procedure is described in great detail by the survivors of the incident.&lt;ref name="UIN: BLL01011844448"&gt;{{cite book|title=A True Relation of the late unjust, cruel and barbarous proceedings against the English at Amboyna|year=1624|publisher=John Skinner of the East India Company|location=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The manner of his torture was as follows: First they hoisted him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him fast upon two staples of iron, fixed on both sides, at the top of the door posts, having his hands one from the other as wide as they could stretch. Being thus made fast, his feet hung some two foot from the ground; which also they stretched asunder as far as they would stretch, and so made them fast beneath unto the door trees on each side. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face so close, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher; so that he could not draw breath, but he must with all suck in the water: which being still continued to be poured in softly, forced all his inward parts, come out of his nose, ears, eyes, and often as it were stifling and choking him, at length took away his breath, and brought him to a swoon or fainting. Then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they trussed him up again, and poured water as before, taking him down as soon as he seemed to be stifled. In this manner they handled him three or four several times with water, until his body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== France ===
[[File:Marquise de Brinvilliers.jpg|thumb|right|Marquise of Brinvilliers being tortured.]]

Water torture was used extensively and legally by the courts of France from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 17th and 18th centuries.  It was known as being put to "the question", with the '''ordinary question''' involving the forcing of one gallon (eight [[pint]]s or approximately 3.6 [[litre]]s) of water into the stomach and the '''extraordinary question''' involving the forcing of two gallons (sixteen pints or approximately 7.3 litres).

The French poet and criminal [[François Villon]] was subjected to this torture in 1461.&lt;ref name=JanetPierre /&gt; [[Jean Calas]] suffered this torture before being [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] in 1762.&lt;ref name=Harvey2000 /&gt; The true case of the [[Madame de Brinvilliers|Marquise of Brinvilliers]] was reported in fiction by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in "The Leather Funnel", by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], in ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1175/__P6.HTM ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers'' at Intratext]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Émile Gaboriau]] in ''Intrigues of a Poisoner''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BoCAAAAQAAJ ''Intrigues of a Poisoner'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
A form of water cure known as the [[Schwedentrunk|Swedish drink]] was used by various international troops against the German population during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

=== Spain ===
Water cure was among the forms of torture used by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Inquisition at [[Málaga]] subjected the Scottish traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] to this torture, among other methods, in 1620. He described his ordeal in ''Rare Adventures and Painful Peregrinations'' (1632) :&lt;ref name=Hadfield2001 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first and second [measures of water] I gladly received, such was the scorching drought of my tormenting pain, and likewise I had drunk none for three days before. But afterward, at the third charge, perceiving these measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O strangling tortures! I closed my lips, gainstanding that eager crudelity. Whereat the alcalde enraging, set my teeth asunder with a pair of iron cadges, detaining them there, at every several turn, both mainly and manually; whereupon my hunger-clunged belly waxing great, grew drum-like imbolstered: for it being a suffocating pain, in regard of my head hanging downward, and the water reingorging itself in my throat with a struggling force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from yowling and groaning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before pouring the water, torturers often inserted an iron prong (known as the ''bostezo'') into a victim's mouth to keep it open, as well as a strip of linen (known as the ''toca'') on which the victim would choke and suffocate while swallowing the water.&lt;ref name=HenryCharlesLea /&gt;

[[File:Life 05-22-1902.JPG|thumb|right|Cartoon on the May 22, 1902 cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine depicting American application of the water cure while Europeans watch. The caption reads: "Chorus in background: 'Those pious Yankees can't throw stones at us any more.{{'"}}]]

The water cure was among the forms of torture used by American soldiers on [[Philippines|Filipinos]] during the [[Philippine–American War]].&lt;ref name=MilleronTaft /&gt;&lt;ref name=Welch1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] privately assured a friend that the water cure was "an old Filipino method of mild torture. Nobody was seriously damaged whereas the Filipinos had inflicted incredible tortures on our people."&lt;ref name=Morison1902 /&gt; The president went further, stating, "Nevertheless, torture is not a thing that we can tolerate." However, a report at the time noted its lethality; "a soldier who was with [[Frederick Funston|General Funston]] had stated that he helped to administer the water cure to one hundred and sixty natives, all but twenty-six of whom died".&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; See the [[Lodge Committee]] for detailed testimony of the use of the water cure.

U.S. Army Major Edwin Glenn was suspended from command for one month and fined $50 for using the water cure in an incident which occurred on November 27, 1900. The Army judge advocate said the charges constituted "resort to torture with a view to extort a confession" and recommended disapproval because "the United States cannot afford to sanction the addition of torture".&lt;ref name=Kramer2008 /&gt;{{efn|A 2008 article on the [[National Public Radio]] website mistakenly asserted that this incident occurred during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; However, that war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10, 1898.}}

Lieutenant Grover Flint during the Philippine–American War:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man is thrown down on his back and three or four men sit or stand on his arms and legs and hold him down; and either a gun barrel or a rifle barrel or a carbine barrel or a stick as big as a [[belaying pin]],{{spaced ndash}}that is, with an inch circumference,{{spaced ndash}}is simply thrust into his jaws and his jaws are thrust back, and, if possible, a wooden log or stone is put under his head or neck, so he can be held more firmly. In the case of very old men I have seen their teeth fall out,{{spaced ndash}}I mean when it was done a little roughly. He is simply held down and then water is poured onto his face down his throat and nose from a jar; and that is kept up until the man gives some sign or becomes unconscious. And, when he becomes unconscious, he is simply rolled aside and he is allowed to come to. In almost every case the men have been a little roughly handled. They were rolled aside rudely, so that water was expelled. A man suffers tremendously, there is no doubt about it. His sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning, but cannot drown.&lt;ref name=MilleronPhilippines /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''The Forging of the American Empire'' [[Sidney Lens]] recounted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A reporter for the New York Evening Post (April 8, 1902) gave some harrowing details. The native, he said, is thrown on the ground, his arms and legs pinned down, and head partially raised "so as to make pouring in the water an easier matter". If the prisoner tries to keep his mouth closed, his nose is pinched to cut off the air and force him to open his mouth, or a bamboo stick is put in the opening. In this way water is steadily poured in, one, two, three, four, five gallons, until the body becomes "an object frightful to contemplate". In this condition, of course, speech is impossible, so the water is squeezed out of the victim, sometimes naturally, and sometimes{{spaced ndash}}as a young soldier with a smile told the correspondent{{spaced ndash}}"we jump on them to get it out quick." One or two such treatments and the prisoner either talks or dies.&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Police ====
The use of "[[third degree interrogation]]" techniques in order to compel confession, ranging from "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread in early American policing as late as the 1930s. Author Daniel G. Lassiter classified the water cure as "orchestrated physical abuse", and described the police technique as a "modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages." The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils.&lt;ref name=Lassiter2004 /&gt;{{rp|47}} Such techniques were classified as "'covert' third degree torture" since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence in order to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|42}} The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the [[Wickersham Commission]]'s "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|38}}

=== Japan ===
During [[World War II]], water cure was among the forms of torture used by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops (especially the [[Kempeitai]]) in occupied territory. A report from the postwar [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] summarized it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The so-called "water treatment" was commonly used. The victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach until he lost consciousness. Pressure was then applied, sometimes by jumping upon his abdomen to force the water out. The usual practice was to revive the victim and successively repeat the process.&lt;ref name=IntMilTribunal /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chase Nielsen|Chase J. Nielson]], who was captured in the [[Doolittle raid]], testified at the trial of his captors, "I was given several types of torture … I was given what they call the water cure" and it felt "more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death."&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;

=== Philippines ===
The water cure has had a long history of use in during Philippines's colonial history, having been used during the Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations.  After Philippine Independence in 1945, the most notable instances of its use by the Philippine government was by the dictatorship of former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="Marcelo2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |title=ORAL ARGUMENTS ON HERO’S BURIAL: Torture victims tell SC of tales of horror under Marcos’ Martial Law |last=Marcelo |first=Elisabeth |date=21 August 2016 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232303/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |archive-date=2017-12-29 |dead-url=No |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoy2007"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xNpWEAg2B7UC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=maria+elena+ang+water&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0MUPG2oFlv&amp;sig=hUZep6MuqXET4cwVWPdNWgw2QKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJvbW3sLbaAhVEnJQKHUlMB3YQ6AEwC3oECAAQWg#v=onepage&amp;q=maria%2520elena%2520ang%2520water&amp;f=false |title=A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror |last=McCoy |first=Alfred |date=2007-04-01 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=9781429900683 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Marcos Regime ====
The water cure was one of the torture methods most used frequently by the [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)|Marcos Regime in the Philippines from 1965 to 1986,]] whose torturers referred to the practice as NAWASA sessions - a reference to the [[National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority]] which supplied water to the Metro Manila area at the time.&lt;ref name="Garcia2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9zbCwAAQBAJ |title=Thirty Years Later&amp;nbsp;...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">In mathematics, a '''weighted Voronoi diagram''' in ''n'' dimensions is a special case of a [[Voronoi diagram]]. The Voronoi cells in a weighted Voronoi diagram are defined in terms of a distance function. The distance function may specify the usual [[Euclidean distance]], or may be some other, special distance function. Usually, the distance function is a function of the generator points' weights.

The '''multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram''' is defined when the distance between points is multiplied by positive weights.&lt;ref name=deza&gt;"Dictionary of distances", by Elena Deza  and [[Michel Deza]] [https://www.google.com/books?id=Xe2AZS6NcVAC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22weighted+voronoi+diagram%22 pp. 255, 256]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the plane under the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]], the multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram is also called '''circular Dirichlet tessellation'''&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Ash1 and Ethan D. Bolker, [Generalized Dirichlet tessellations http://www.springerlink.com/content/j334537p07370405/], ''[[Geometriae Dedicata]]'', 	Volume 20, Number 2 , 209-243{{doi|10.1007/BF00164401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: "[[Dirichlet tessellation]]" is a synonym for "Voronoi diagram".&lt;/ref&gt; and its edges are circular arc and straight line segments. A Voronoi cell may be non-convex, disconnected and may have holes. This diagram arises, e.g., as a model of [[crystal growth]], where crystals from different points may grow with different speed. Since crystals may grow in empty space only and are continuous objects, a natural variation is the '''crystal Voronoi diagram''', in which the cells are defined somewhat differently.

The '''additively weighted Voronoi diagram''' is defined when positive weights are subtracted  from the distances between points. In the plane under the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]] this diagram is also known as the '''hyperbolic Dirichlet tessellation''' and its edges are hyperbolic arc and straight line segments.&lt;ref name=deza/&gt;

The [[power diagram]] is defined when weights are added to the [[quadrance|squared Euclidean distance]]. It can also be defined using the [[power of a point|power distance]] defined from a set of circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''white-flippered penguin''' (''Eudyptula minor albosignata'') is a small penguin about {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} tall and weighing {{convert|1.5|kg|abbr=on}}. It gains its name from the white markings on its [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, unique to the [[subspecies]]. It nests only on [[Banks Peninsula]] and [[Motunau Island]], near [[Canterbury Region|Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], with only around 3,750 breeding pairs.

==Taxonomy==
The white-flippered penguin is currently considered by most [[taxonomists]] to be a colour [[morph (zoology)|morph]] or subspecies of the [[little penguin]] (''E. minor''). Analysis of [[mtDNA]] in 2002 revealed two [[clade]]s in ''[[Eudyptula]]'': one containing little penguins of New Zealand's [[North Island]], [[Cook Strait]] and [[Chatham Island]], as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the southeastern coast of New Zealand's [[South Island]].&lt;ref name=Banks&gt;Banks, Jonathan C.; Mitchell, Anthony D.; Waas, Joseph R. &amp; Paterson, Adrian M. (2002): An unexpected pattern of molecular divergence within the blue penguin (''Eudyptula minor'') complex. ''Notornis'' '''49'''(1): 29–38. [http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_49_1_29.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary analysis of braying calls and [[cluster analysis]] of [[morphometrics]] partially supported these results.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; In 2008, [[Hadoram Shirihai|Shirihai]] treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as [[allospecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirihai, Hadoram (2008). The Complete Guide to Antarctic Wildlife, 2d Edition. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2012, the [[IUCN]] and [[BirdLife International]] consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin.

==Habitat==
White-flippered penguins live in [[headland]]s, [[caves]], rock jumbles, and in the sheltered areas at the bases of bays. They are found mostly in [[Canterbury Region|Canterbury]], New Zealand.

==General behaviour==
White-flippered penguins are primarily [[nocturnal]] animals on land and are unique among penguins in this respect. They differ from other penguins in that they stay with the [[Bird colony|colony]] during the day, and then leave under the cover of darkness and return before dawn. However, on Banks Peninsula, some birds can be observed on land outside their [[burrow]]s during daylight.

In the evening, these penguins tend to assemble offshore in groups until light levels are low enough for them to feel sufficiently safe to head inland. This results in large batches of birds arriving at one time.

==Breeding==
The white-flippered penguin lays its [[bird egg|eggs]] from July to December, with most egg-laying occurring August through November. The eggs are always laid in burrows under tree brush almost like nests; they are also laid in [[dune]]s, or on vegetated slopes, and are incubated for 33 to 39 days. Chicks [[fledge]] after 50 to 65 days.

==Feeding==
The white-flippered penguin feeds on small [[shoal]]ing fish, such as [[pilchards]] and [[anchovies]], or [[cephalopods]], and less often on [[crustaceans]]. It catches its food by pursuit diving. Most feeding takes place within {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} of the coast with daily round trips. The farthest trip out to sea for food was {{convert|75|km|abbr=on}} offshore.

==Conservation==
In August 2010 the white-flippered penguin was listed as endangered under the US [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name=Penguin&gt;[http://www.seaturtles.org/article.php?id=1742 Five Penguins Win U.S. Endangered Species Act Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Motunau Beach Biodiversity Development Team are working on a conservation project for white-flippered penguins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/motunaubeachbiodiversity/ Motunau Beach Biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shepherds Flat Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] is an 845&amp;nbsp;MW wind farm in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]]

A '''wind farm''' or '''wind park''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm can also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the [[List of onshore wind farms|largest wind farm in the world]], [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has a capacity of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] as of 2012,&lt;ref name="Guardian-2012.03.19"&gt;Watts, Jonathan &amp; Huang, Cecily.

Retrieved 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. As of September 2018, the 659&amp;nbsp;MW [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the UK is [[List of offshore wind farms#Top 25 operational offshore wind farms|the largest offshore wind farm in the world]].&lt;ref name=guardianworldslargest&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/06/worlds-largest-offshore-windfarm-opens-cumbrian-coast-walney-extension-brexit|title=World's largest offshore wind farm opens off Cumbrian coast|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. See [[List of most powerful wind turbines|list of most powerful wind turbines]].

== Design and location ==
[[File:United States Wind Resources and Transmission Lines map.jpg|thumb|Map of available wind power over the United States. Color codes indicate wind power density class]]
The location is critical to the success of a wind farm. Conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electric prices.

The faster the average windspeed the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are economically better for wind farm developers. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise they risk damage. The ideal wind conditions would be strong steady winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction.

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a [[wind atlas]], and validated with wind measurements. [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential&lt;ref name=eweaFact&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W0dre8-5FAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=da Wind energy-- the facts: a guide to the technology, economics and future of wind power] page 32 ''[[EWEA]]'' 2009.

The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings.

How closely to space the turbines together is a major factor in wind farm design. The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their neighbors. However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and cables, and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking manufacturers require 3.5 times the rotor diameter of the turbine between turbines as a minimum. Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[wikt:onshore|Onshore]] turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the [[topographic acceleration]] as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.

== Offshore installations ==
[[File:DanishWindTurbines.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Offshore wind turbines near [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.]]
{{See also|Offshore wind power|List of offshore wind farms|Lists of offshore wind farms by country}}

Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with [[Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm|the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby)]] being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.&lt;ref name=eesi2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |author-link=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2017}}, The [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by the [[London Array]] (630 MW) also in the UK.

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. [[Capacity factor]]s (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.&lt;ref name="Garvinel2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garvine | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kempton | first2 = Willett | title = Assessing the wind field over the continental shelf as a resource for electric power | journal = Journal of Marine Research | year = 2008 | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–773 | issn = 0022-2402 | url = http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 November 2009 | doi = 10.1357/002224008788064540 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083622/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast;&lt;ref name=eesi2010/&gt; and in late 2016 the [[Block Island Wind Farm]] was commissioned.

Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. {{asof|2015}}, there are 20 [[Jackup rig|jackup vessels]] for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/industri/skip/2016/01/15/slik-utstyres-de-norske-skipene-for-a-takle-nye-gigant-vindmoller|title=Slik utstyres de norske skipene for å takle nye gigant-vindmøller|author=Jannicke Nilsen|work=Tu.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.

== Experimental and proposed wind farms ==
There exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines. In such wind farms, there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine. Such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower. An example of an experimental wind farm is [[Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field]].

For some time, airborne wind farms have been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/AWES_Farm_Density.pdf AWES Farm Density] ''Airborne Wind Energy Labs'', March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems near to each other, connected to the grid in the same point.

By the end of 2008, at least 15 Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/16051/1/16051.pdf |author=Caprotti Federico |title=China's Cleantech Landscape: The Renewable Energy Technology Paradox |journal=Sustainable Development Law &amp; Policy |date=Spring 2009 |pages=6–10 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609155830/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/16051/1/16051.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turbine sizes of 1.5&amp;nbsp;MW to 3&amp;nbsp;MW became common.

The [[European Union]] has a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 MW. Germany has the third-largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States) with an installed capacity was 29,060 MW at the end of 2011, and Spain has 21,674 MW. Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=4 |url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/statistics/Stats_2011.pdf |title=Wind in power 2011 European statistics |publisher=[[European Wind Energy Association]] |date=February 2012 |access-date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gwec.net/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Global_Wind_2007_report/GWEC_Global_Wind_2009_Report_LOWRES_15th.%20Apr..pdf | title=GLOBAL WIND 2009 REPORT | date = March 2010|work= |publisher= Global Wind energy council | pages= |doi= |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100705053852/http://www.gwec.net/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Global_Wind_2007_report/GWEC_Global_Wind_2009_Report_LOWRES_15th.%20Apr..pdf|archivedate =2010-07-05| dead-url= yes | accessdate=9 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wind-energy/uk-wind-energy-database/index.cfm |website=RenewableUK |title=UK Wind Energy Database (UKWED) |accessdate=28 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126052422/http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wind-energy/uk-wind-energy-database/index.cfm |archivedate=26 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But energy production can be different from capacity – in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh compared to Germany's 35 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eolicenergynews.org/?p=4082 |title=Spain becomes the first European wind energy producer after overcoming Germany for the first time | work=Eolic Energy News |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2011 |dead-url=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427085056/http://www.eolicenergynews.org/?p=4082 |archive-date=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's largest windfarm is the '[[London Array]]', an off-shore wind farm in the [[Thames Estuary]] in the [[United Kingdom]], with a current capacity of 630 MW (the world's largest off-shore wind farm). Other large wind farms in Europe include [[Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm]] near [[Constanța]], Romania with 600 MW capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cez.cz/en/power-plants-and-environment/wind-power-plant/fantanele-cegealac-wind-park.html | title= Fantanele-Cogealac Wind Park | publisher= Cez Group | accessdate= 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-europe | title= ČEZ says its wind farm in Romania is the biggest in Europe | work= Prague Daily Monitor | date= 12 October 2012 | accessdate= 12 October 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522083617/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-Europe | archive-date= 22 May 2013 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Whitelee Wind Farm]] near [[Glasgow]], Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW.

An important limiting factor of wind power is [[intermittent power source|variable power]] generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "[[European super grid|supergrid]]" to connect national grids together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/16595/|title=A Supergrid for Europe|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across [[western Europe]], ranging from Denmark across the southern [[North Sea]] to England and the [[Celtic Sea]] to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in [[Higueruela]] which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Cifuentes |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Víctor M. Rodríguez |url=http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |title=Renewable energy |page=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093335/http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that by the time a [[low pressure area]] has moved away from Denmark to the [[Baltic Sea]] the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.

Morocco has undertaken a vast wind energy program, to support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country. The Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project, spanning over a period of 10 years with a total investment estimated at $3.25 billion, will enable the country to bring the installed capacity, from wind energy, from 280 MW in 2010 to 2000 MW in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.invest.gov.ma/?Id=67&amp;lang=en&amp;RefCat=3&amp;Ref=146|title=Invest in Morocco - Wind Energy|website=www.invest.gov.ma|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mem.gov.ma/SitePages/GrandsChantiers/DEEREnergieEolienne.aspx|title=Energie Eolienne|website=www.mem.gov.ma|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
[[File:Jhimpir Wind Farm 2012.jpg|thumb|Jhimpir Wind Farm]]
Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW.
Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has build a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW will be completed.Pakistani Govt. also has issued LOI of 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. Pakistani Govt. has plans to achieve electric power up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down energy shortage.

Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Ltd 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Ltd 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Ltd 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy ) and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

In Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 &amp; II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Ltd 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt Ltd 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which only the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located Northern part of the countries' biggest island Luzon, alongside the seashore of [[Bangui, Ilocos Norte|Bangui]], [[Ilocos Norte]].

The wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070&amp;nbsp;ft) apart, each 70 metres (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with 41 metres (135&amp;nbsp;ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269&amp;nbsp;ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft). Phase II, was completed on August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Adjacent municipalities of [[Burgos, Ilocos Norte|Burgos]] and [[Pagudpud]] followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively.

Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the [[Pililla Wind Farm]] in Rizal and the [[Mindoro Wind Farm]] near [[Puerto Galera]] in [[Oriental Mindoro]].

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France’s Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka is building two 100MW wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in Northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|title=ADB grants $ 300 m to boost renewable energy|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083210/http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perception is that renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/23/people-want-more-renewable-energy |title=Nine out of 10 people want more renewable energy |date=23 April 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |title=Renewables 2015 Global Status Report |publisher=[[REN21]] |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721013559/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition. A study has shown&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Theresa M., and Christine A. Vogt. "Rural wind farm development: Social, environmental and economic features important to local residents." Renewable Energy 63.2014 (2013): 1-8. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development."

Wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites. The viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon, instead falling to the developer. For example, Sturge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sturge, D., A. While, and R. Howell. "Engineering and energy yield: The missing dimension of wind turbine assessment." Energy Policy 65.2014 (2013): 245-50. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular, engineering aspects, specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration, either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development. As energy is the main purpose of wind farms, a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms.

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Begoña Guezuraga |author2=Rudolf Zauner |author3=Werner Pölz |title=Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines |journal=[[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2012 |page=37 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"/&gt; While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |author=Mark Diesendorf |journal=Dissent |issue=13 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=43-48 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human health ===
{{See also|Health effects from noise}}
There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' causing [[Vibroacoustic disease]], although some suggest further research might still be useful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/dam/cec/technologies/wind/fact-sheets/Wind-farms-and-health-fact-sheet-Jan-2015/Wind%20farms%20and%20health%20fact%20sheet%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf 'Wind Energy - The Facts', p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.&lt;ref name="NRC1"&gt;Committee on Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects, National Research Council (2007). [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11935&amp;page=158 ''Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects'', p. 158-9].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.&lt;ref name="NSW1"&gt;General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5, Parliament of New South Wales (16 December 2009). [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ea247659081d31fdca25768e001a2e2a/$FILE/091216%20Report%20-%20Rural%20wind%20farms.pdf "Final Report, Rural Wind Farms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper suggests that the 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' is mainly caused by the [[nocebo]] effect and other psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Novella2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=GJ|last2=Burns|first2=M|last3=Wessely|first3=S|authorlink3=Simon Wessely|title=Possible psychological mechanisms for "wind turbine syndrome".

=== Effect on power grid ===
{{See also|Wind power#Electricity generation}}

Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM, L.L.C., BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 2, L.L.C., AND BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 3, L.L.C.'S APPEAL AND COMPLAINT OF ERCOT'S DECISION AND ACTION REGARDING PRR 830 AND MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF ACTION|url=http://www.ercot.com/content/about/governance/legal/notices/37827_Buffalo_Gap_Wind_Farm_Appeal_Complaint_PRR_830.pdf|website=ERCOT.com|publisher=ERCOT|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Ground radar interference ===
[[File:NOAA windturbine-radar-interference.gif|thumb|Wind farm interference (in yellow circle) on radar map]]

Wind farms can interfere with ground [[radar]] systems used for [[military]], [[Weather radar|weather]] and [[air traffic control]]. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern.&lt;ref name="noaaWR"&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=windfarm Wind farm interference showing up on Doppler radar] ''[[National Weather Service]]''.

==== Effects ====
The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning.&lt;ref name="gsnWR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first= Jacob|url= http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22124?c=airport_aviation_security |title=DHS asks Raytheon to study impact of wind turbines on radar systems|website=gsnmagazine.com|date= 3 January 2011|accessdate= 9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration.&lt;ref name="wefWR"&gt;[http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html Radars and radio signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407155949/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html |date=7 April 2011 }} ''Wind Energy Facts''.

Permanent problem solving include a ''non-initiation window'' to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm, and a similar method mitigates the false returns.&lt;ref name="stasysWR"&gt;P Jago, N Taylor.

Wind turbines can often cause terrestrial television interference when the direct path between television transmitter and receiver is blocked by terrain. Interference effects become significant when the reflected signal from the turbine blades approaches the strength of the direct unreflected signal. Reflected signals from the turbine blades can cause loss of picture, pixellation and disrupted sound. There is a common misunderstanding that digital TV signals will not be affected by turbines — in practice they are.

=== Agriculture ===
A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.&lt;ref name=agriwind1&gt;Roy, Somnath Baidya. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/17899.abstract?sid=47909b69-b82f-49d4-97d9-debb5d1ff65b Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures] ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', 4 October 2010. Retrieved 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study an analysis carried out on [[corn]] and [[soybean]] crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.&lt;ref name=agriwind2&gt;Takle, Gene and Lundquist, Julie.
