'''Alfred Schutz''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ʊ|t|s}}; born '''Alfred Schütz''', {{IPA-de|ʃʏts|lang}}; 13 April 1899 – 20 May 1959) was an Austrian philosopher and social phenomenologist whose work bridged [[sociological]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] traditions. Schutz is gradually being recognized as one of the twentieth century's leading philosophers of social science.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Schütz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (Illinois 1997) p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; He related [[Edmund Husserl]]'s work to the social sciences, and influenced Max Weber's legacy of philosophical foundations for sociology and economics through Schutz's major work, ''Phenomenology of the Social World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Michael|title=Alfred Schutz|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schutz/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life and background ===
Schutz was born in Vienna, Austria, into an upper-middle-class Jewish family as an only child. Following his graduation from high school he was drafted into the Austrian army, where he quickly rose to the American equivalent rank of second lieutenant. His army regiment was dispatched to fight in a series of heavy battles on the Italian front (WWI).

=== Education and later life ===
Schutz enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] from where he received his law degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Participating Citizen: A Biography of Alfred Schutz|last=Barber|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at the University of Vienna he also enrolled at the [http://www.wiiw.ac.at/ Viennese Academy of International Trade] from 1919 to 1920 and adopted a concentration in International Law. During his time at the University of Vienna, Schutz went to lectures given by Max Weber, and felt that Weber had left the problem of meaning unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=314|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Wagner (1983), Schutz's fascination with the problem of meaning was a result of his experience in combat, combined with returning to starving and economically decimated Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Schutz: An Intellectual Biography|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=6|last1=Wagner|first1=Helmut R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 Schutz married Ilse Heim, after developing a well-established and prominent career in international banking. He became the chief financial officer for Reitler and Company, the Vienna banking firm. In 1933 the threat of Hitler's rise in Germany caused Schutz and other Viennese intellectuals to flee Austria in order to seek asylum in allied countries. Consequently, Schutz and his family relocated to Paris in 1938 in political exile. Schutz worked as an international lawyer for Reitler and Company, and moved to the United States in 1939, where he became a faculty member of The New School. He taught sociology and philosophy as well as serving as chair of the Philosophy department. Schutz is unique as a scholar of the social sciences in that he pursued a career in law for most of his life, while teaching part-time at the New School for Social Research in New York. Moreover, he produced key papers in phenomenological sociology that fill four volumes (published by Nijhoff, The Hague), while working full-time at the bank. Schutz received a substantial amount of assistance from his wife Ilse, who transcribed his working notes and letters from his taped dictations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in classical sociological theory : seeing the social world|year=2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412905725|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schutz died in New York City at the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2010|publisher=Pine Forge Press|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual life==

While Schutz primarily focused on phenomenology and social science methodology his principal aim was to create a philosophical foundation for the [[social sciences]]. Schutz was strongly influenced by [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[William James]], and [[Edmund Husserl]]. Contrary to common belief, while Schutz's work paralleled [[George Herbert Mead]]’s analysis of the meanings within social interactions, Schutz was highly critical of Mead’s behavioristic approach.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;Walsh, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schutz was never a student of Husserl he and colleague [[Felix Kaufmann]] intensively studied Husserl's work in order to seek a basis for the interpretive sociology derived from Max Weber. In 1932 Schutz’s efforts resulted in his first published book, ''Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt'' (literally, "the meaningful construction of the social world") which was published in English as ''The Phenomenology of the Social World''. Schutz took up the generic emphasis of phenomenology, arguing that everyday life – other than philosophical or scientific theories – is most important for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks, CA 91320|isbn=9781412905725|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication brought him to the attention of Husserl, whom he visited often after the publication and corresponded with until Husserl's death (1938). Even so, when Husserl asked Schutz to be his assistant, he was unable to accept the offer&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; at [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|Freiburg University]] for personal reasons.

Schutz's main concerns were with how people grasp the consciousness of others while they live within their own stream of consciousness. He talked much about intersubjectivity, but in a larger sense. He used it to mean a concern with the social world, specifically the social nature of knowledge. A great deal of his work deals with the "life world". Within this, people create social reality under the constraints of preexisting social and cultural factors and structures. He was very focused on the "dialectical relationship between the way people construct social reality and the obdurate social and cultural reality that they inherit from those who preceded them in the social world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Schutz's writings had a lasting impact on sociology, both on [[Phenomenological Sociology|phenomenological approaches to sociology]] (especially through the work of [[Thomas Luckmann]] and [[Peter L. Berger]]) and in [[ethnomethodology]] through the writings of [[Harold Garfinkel]]. Luckmann was heavily influenced by Schutz's work.  Luckmann, a student of Schutz's (along with Peter L. Berger), ultimately finished Schutz's work on the structures of the [[Lifeworld]] after Schutz died by filling out his unfinished notes. Berger and Luckmann went on to use Schutz's work to further understand human culture and reality, through the development of a new form of the sociology of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenneth|first=Allan|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2010|publisher=Pine Forge Press|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Farganis (2011), Peter Berger is arguably the best-known living sociologist influenced by Schutz, owing his creation of social construction theory which explains how the processes of externalization, objectification, and internalization contribute to the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farganis|first1=James|title=Readings in Social Theory:  The Classical Tradition to Post-Modernism|date=2011|publisher=Mc-Graw Hill|location=New York|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenomenology===
Phenomenology originated with Edmund Husserl.  Schutz met Husserl and studied his work. Phenomenology is the study of things as they appear (phenomena). It is also often said to be descriptive rather than explanatory: a central task of phenomenology is to provide a clear, undistorted description of the ways things appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Joel|title=Phenomenology|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/phenom/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its creation. First, it rejects the concept of objective research. Phenomenologists would rather group presumptions through a process called ''phenomenological epoche''. Second, phenomenology believes that analyzing the daily human behavior will provide one with a comprehensive understanding of nature. The third assumption is that persons, not individuals, should be explored and questioned. Sociologically speaking, this is in part because persons can be better understood by the unique ways they reflect and symbolize the society he or she lives in. Fourth, phenomenologists prefer to gather “capta,” or ''conscious experience'', rather than traditional data. Finally, phenomenology is considered to be oriented on discovery, and therefore phenomenologists gather research using methods that are far less restricting than in other sciences.&lt;ref name="In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Communication Theory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Orbe|first=Mark P.|title=Phenomenology|year=2009|publisher=Thousand Oaks|location=CA|page=(pp. 750–752)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social phenomenology===

Social phenomenology is the combination of the social construction of reality and [[ethnomethodology]]. It was concerned with how people use ordinary, everyday interactions to produce a feeling of reality and intersubjectivity. Most of Schutz's work concerned the methods used for the construction of reality through everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 Key Sociologists: The Formative Theorists|last=Scott|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Farganis (2011) phenomenological sociology is characterized as particularly subjective in nature because its emphasis of understanding reality through the perspective of the acting subject rather than through the lens of the scientific observer.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farganis|first1=James|title=Readings In Social Theory: The Classic Tradition to Post-Modernism|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-07-811155-6|pages=257|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempting to uncover and document the social structures which influence our social world Schutz and other sociological phenomenologists seek not only to identify the content of our consciousness related to our conception of the social reality of everyday life but also, how this reality comes to assume the form it is.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill" /&gt; In essence, Schutz and social phenomenologists are principally concerned with the happenings of everyday life or what Schutz refers to as the ‘[[Lifeworld|life world]]’. As noted by Ritzer (2011) the life world “is an intersubjective world in which people both create social reality and are constrained by the preexisting social and cultural structures created by their predecessors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this world, relationships between the social and natural world are what come into doubt. There is this existence of meaning which comes into play yet most people simply accept the world how it is and never second guess the concept or problem of meaning.[14] Schutz delves even more into specific relationships such as the difference between intimate face-to-face relationships and distant and impersonal relationships.

====The four divisions of the lifeworld====
Schutz's division of Husserl's ''Lebenswelt'' (the mundane [[lifeworld]]) into four distinct sub-worlds is perhaps his most influential theoretical contribution. The theory of the lifeworld is that social experience creates a world that is separated between social reality that has been directly experienced and social reality that is on the horizon of direct experience.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;Walsh, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; The former consisted of the ''Umwelt'' of what Schutz termed consociates or fellow-men – of the man who "shares with me a community of space and a community of time".&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, those who Schutz did not deem his fellow-men, he put them in three classes: the world of contemporaries (Mitwelt), the world of predecessors (Vorwelt). and the world of successors (Folgewelt).&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; The last two represent the past and the future, whereas one's contemporaries share a community of time, if not space, and are different from the predecessors and successors because it is possible for them to become fellow-men or consociates.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

Schutz was interested in documenting the transition from direct to indirect experience and the series of experiences in between.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to map the progressive anonymisation of the contemporaries (''Mitwelt)'', which was a measurement of increasing anonymity of "my absent friend, his brother whom he has described to me, the professor whose books I have read, the postal clerk, the Canadian Parliament, abstract entities like Canada herself, the rules of English grammar, or the basic principles of jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Schutz argued that the more one goes into the contemporary world, the more anonymous the contemporary inhabitants become, with the most anonymous being artifacts of any kind that hold meaning, context, and suggest there are unknown people.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later writings, Schutz explored how everyday social experiences that pertain to these dimensions are most often intertwined in varying degrees of anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schütz, ''The Problem of Social Reality'' (The Hague 1973) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "if in a face-to-face relationship with a friend I discuss a magazine article dealing with the attitude of the President and Congress toward China, I am in a relationship not only with the perhaps anonymous contemporary writer of the article but also with the contemporary individual or collective actors on the social scene designated by the terms, 'President', 'Congress', 'China'".&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Social Reality'' p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assisted reproductive technology''' ('''ART''') are medical procedures used primarily to address [[infertility]]. It includes procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]]. It may include [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), [[cryopreservation]] of gametes or embryos, and/or may involve the use of  [[fertility medication]]. When used to address infertility, it may also be referred to as '''fertility treatment.''' ART mainly belongs to the field of [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|reproductive endocrinology and infertility.]] Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons ([[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]). ART may also be used in [[surrogacy]] arrangements, although not all surrogacy arrangements involve ART.

==Procedures==

===General===
With ART, the process of [[sexual intercourse]] is bypassed and fertilization of the [[oocyte]]s occurs in the laboratory environment (i.e., [[in vitro fertilization]]).

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)—which is required as a result of the 1992 ''Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act'' to publish the annual ART success rates at U.S. fertility clinics—defines ART to include "all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman."  According to CDC, "they do not include treatments in which only sperm are handled (i.e., intrauterine—or artificial—insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Assisted Reproductive Technology? {{!}} Reproductive Health  {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|publisher=CDC|date=November 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101183209/https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|archivedate=November 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, ART also excludes artificial insemination and includes only procedures where oocytes are handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology|last2=Calhaz-Jorge|first2=C., et al|last10=Wyns|title=Assisted reproductive technology in Europe, 2012: results generated from European registers by ESHRE.|journal=Human reproduction (Oxford, England)|date=August 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1638–52|pmid=27496943|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/17/humrep.dew151.full|doi=10.1093/humrep/dew151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorenson|first1=Corinna|title=ART in the European Union|journal=Euro Observer Euro Observer|date=Autumn 2006|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129022850/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO also defines ART this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zegers-Hochschild|first1=F, et al|last2=for the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology and the World Health Organization|title=International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ICMART) and the World Health Organization (WHO) revised glossary of ART terminology, 2009.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=November 2009|volume=92|issue=5|pages=1520–4|pmid=19828144|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.09.009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129024154/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility medication===
Most fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone.

===In vitro fertilization===
In vitro fertilization is the technique of letting [[fertilization]] of the male and female [[gametes]] (sperm and egg) occur outside the female body.

Techniques usually used in in vitro fertilization include:
* [[Transvaginal ovum retrieval]] (OVR) is the process whereby a small needle is inserted through the back of the vagina and guided via ultrasound into the ovarian follicles to collect the fluid that contains the eggs.
* [[Embryo transfer]] is the step in the process whereby one or several embryos are placed into the uterus of the female with the intent to establish a pregnancy.
Less commonly used techniques in in vitro fertilization are: 
* [[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) is performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
* [[Image:In_vitro_fertilization.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]][[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) is beneficial in the case of male factor infertility where sperm counts are very low or failed fertilization occurred with previous IVF attempt(s). The ICSI procedure involves a single sperm carefully injected into the center of an egg using a microneedle. With ICSI, only one sperm per egg is needed. Without ICSI, you need between 50,000 and 100,000.  This method is also sometimes employed when donor sperm is used.
* [[Autologous endometrial coculture]] is a possible treatment for patients who have failed previous IVF attempts or who have poor embryo quality. The patient's fertilized eggs are placed on top of a layer of cells from the patient's own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development.
* In [[zygote intrafallopian transfer]] (ZIFT), egg cells are removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilized in the laboratory; the resulting zygote is then placed into the fallopian tube.
* [[Cytoplasmic transfer]] is the technique in which the contents of a fertile egg from a donor are injected into the infertile egg of the patient along with the sperm.
* [[Egg donor]]s are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilized in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
* [[Sperm donation]] may provide the source for the sperm used in IVF procedures where the male partner produces no sperm or has an inheritable disease, or where the woman being treated has no male partner.
* [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) involves the use of genetic screening mechanisms such as fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to help identify genetically abnormal embryos and improve healthy outcomes.
* [[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|date=February 2009 |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis===
A [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] procedure may be conducted on [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific [[genetic disease]], its main advantage is that it avoids selective [[abortion|pregnancy termination]] as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612258/are-we-designing-inequality-into-our-genes/|title=Designer babies aren’t futuristic. They’re already here.|last=Hercher|first=Laura|date=2018-10-22|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGD thus is an adjunct to ART procedures, and requires [in vitro fertilization to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development.&lt;ref name=Sullivan-Pyke2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sullivan-Pyke |first1=C |last2=Dokras |first2=A |title=Preimplantation Genetic Screening and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis. |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America |date=March 2018 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=113-125 |doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2017.10.009 |pmid=29428279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sex selection]] is the attempt to control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, as well as at birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also [[sperm sorting]].

===Others===
Other assisted reproduction techniques include:
* [[Mitochondrial replacement therapy]] (MRT, sometimes called mitochondrial donation) is the replacement of [[mitochondria]] in one or more cells to prevent or ameliorate disease. MRT originated as a special form of IVF in which some or all of the future baby's [[mitochondrial DNA]] comes from a third party. This technique is used in cases when mothers carry genes for [[mitochondrial diseases]]. The therapy is approved for use in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=NAS2016ethics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Ethical and Social Policy Considerations of Novel Techniques for Prevention of Maternal Transmission of Mitochondrial DNA Diseases|last2=Board on Health Sciences Policy|last3=Institute of Medicine|editor1-last=Claiborne|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=English|editor2-first=Rebecca|editor3-last=Kahn|editor3-first=Jeffrey|title=Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques:  Ethical, Social, and Policy Considerations|date=2016|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-38870-2|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/21871/chapter/1}} [http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2016/Mitochondrial-Replacement-Techniques Index page] with links to summaries including [http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2016/Mitochondrial%20Replacement%20Techniques/mito%20ethics%20infographic_FINAL.pdf one page summary flyer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2015CreeRev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cree|first1=L|last2=Loi|first2=P|title=Mitochondrial replacement: from basic research to assisted reproductive technology portfolio tool-technicalities and possible risks.|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|date=January 2015|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–10|pmid=25425606|doi=10.1093/molehr/gau082}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) a mixture of sperm and eggs is placed directly into a woman's fallopian tubes using laparoscopy following a transvaginal ovum retrieval.
* [[Reproductive surgery]], treating e.g. [[fallopian tube obstruction]] and [[vas deferens obstruction]], or reversing a [[vasectomy]] by a [[reverse vasectomy]]. In [[surgical sperm retrieval]] (SSR) the reproductive urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, epididymis or directly from the testis in a short outpatient procedure.
* By [[cryopreservation]], eggs, sperm and reproductive tissue can be preserved for later IVF.

==Risks==
The majority of IVF-conceived infants do not have [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s.&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Voorhis BJ |year=2007 |title=Clinical practice. In vitro fertilization |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=356 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |pmid=17251534 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp065743}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some studies have suggested that assisted reproductive technology is associated with an increased risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name="Kurinczuk 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurinczuk JJ, Hansen M, Bower C |year=2004 |title=The risk of birth defects in children born after assisted reproductive technologies |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=201–9 |pmid=15129049 |doi=10.1097/00001703-200406000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen M, Bower C, Milne E, de Klerk N, Kurinczuk JJ |year=2005 |title=Assisted reproductive technologies and the risk of birth defects—a systematic review |journal=Hum Reprod |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=328–38 |pmid=15567881 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/2/328.pdf |doi=10.1093/humrep/deh593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial reproductive technology is becoming more available. Early studies suggest that there could be an increased risk for medical complications with both the mother and baby. Some of these include low birth weight, placental insufficiency, chromosomal disorders, preterm deliveries, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia(Aiken and Brockelsby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S096553951600005X|title=Fetal and Maternal Consequences of Pregnancies Conceived Using Art|journal=Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=281–294|year=2016|last1=Aiken|first1=Catherine E. M.|last2=Brockelsby|first2=Jeremy C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the largest U.S. study, which used data from a statewide registry of birth defects,&lt;ref name="Olson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson CK, Keppler-Noreuil KM, Romitti PA, Budelier WT, Ryan G, Sparks AE, Van Voorhis BJ |year=2005 |title=In vitro fertilization is associated with an increase in major birth defects |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1308–15 |pmid=16275219 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.03.086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
6.2% of IVF-conceived children had major defects, as compared with 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for [[maternal age effect|maternal age]] and other factors ([[odds ratio]], 1.3; 95% [[confidence interval]], 1.00 to 1.67).&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"/&gt; ART carries with it a risk for [[heterotopic pregnancy]] (simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obgmanagement.com/the-latest/feature-articles/article/what-you-should-know-about-heterotopic-pregnancy/56cf1776e64a3aecc3e2b9f225cbc001.html?tx_ttnews%5BsViewPointer%5D=1|title=What you should know about heterotopic pregnancy : OBG Management|last=MD|first=Daniel M. Avery, MD, Marion D. Reed, MD, William L. Lenahan,|website=www.obgmanagement.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main risks are:
* [[Genetic disorder]]s
* [[Low birth weight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007279.htm|title=In vitro fertilization (IVF): MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In IVF and ICSI, a risk factor is the decreased expression of proteins in [[energy metabolism]]; [[Ferritin light chain]] and [[ATP5A1]].&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Zhang YL, Feng C |title=Comparative proteomic analysis of human placenta derived from assisted reproductive technology |journal=Proteomics |volume= 8|issue= 20|pages= 4344–56|date=September 2008 |pmid=18792929 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200800294 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Preterm birth]]. Low birth weight and preterm birth are strongly associated with many health problems, such as [[visual impairment]] and [[cerebral palsy]], and children born after IVF are roughly twice as likely to have cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |year=2009 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |title=Cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, and developmental delay in children born after assisted conception: a systematic review and meta-analysis |vauthors=Hvidtjørn D, Schieve L, Schendel D, Jacobsson B, Sværke C, Thorsen P |pmid=19124707 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.507 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062747/http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other risk factors are:
* [[Membrane damage]]{{Citation needed|reason=The reference Zhang'08 does not contain any direct data on membrane damage.|date=January 2014}}, which may be reflected by increased expression of the [[membrane fusion protein]]s [[NAPA (gene)|NAPA]] and [[Annexin A3]].&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt;
[[Sperm donation]] is an exception, with a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population. It may be explained by that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.

Current data indicate little or no increased risk for [[postpartum depression]] among women who use ART.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq025|title=Risk for postpartum depression associated with assisted reproductive technologies and multiple births: A systematic review|year=2010|last1=Ross|first1=L.

Usage of assisted reproductive technology including [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]] and [[in vitro fertilization]] have been associated with an increased overall risk of [[childhood cancer]] in the offspring, which may be caused by the same original disease or condition that caused the infertility or subfertility in the mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23562045|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.017|title=Fertility treatment and childhood cancer risk: A systematic meta-analysis|year=2013|last1=Hargreave|first1=Marie|last2=Jensen|first2=Allan|last3=Toender|first3=Anita|last4=Andersen|first4=Klaus Kaae|last5=Kjaer|first5=Susanne Krüger|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|pages=150–61|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, In a landmark paper by Jacques Balayla et al. it was determined that infants born after ART have similar neurodevelopment than infants born after natural conception.&lt;ref&gt;Balayla, Jacques, Odile Sheehy, William D. Fraser, Jean R. Séguin, Jacquetta Trasler, Patricia Monnier, Andrea A. MacLeod, Marie-Noëlle Simard, Gina Muckle, and Anick Bérard.

==Usage==
Assisted reproductive technology procedures performed in the U.S. has more than doubled over the last 10 years, with 140,000 procedures in 2006,&lt;ref name=chicagoART&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0621-fertility-dramas-side1jun21,0,7805988.story chicagotribune.com Infertility by the numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705084623/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0621-fertility-dramas-side1jun21,0,7805988.story |date=2009-07-05 }} Colleen Mastony. June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 55,000 births.&lt;ref name=chicagoART/&gt;

In [[Australia]], 3.1% of births are a result of ART.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26117922-12377,00.html 'More IVF babies but less multiple births'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924235447/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26117922-12377,00.html |date=2009-09-24 }} THE AUSTRALIAN.

In case of discontinuation of fertility treatment, the most common reasons have been estimated to be: postponement of treatment (39%), physical and psychological burden (19%, psychological burden 14%, physical burden 6.32%), relational and personal problems (17%, personal reasons 9%, relational problems 9%), treatment rejection (13%) and organizational (12%) and clinic (8%) problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/humupd/dms031|title=Why do patients discontinue fertility treatment?

==Society and culture==
===Ethics===
Some couples find it difficult to stop treatment despite very bad prognosis, resulting in futile therapies. This may give ART providers a difficult decision of whether to continue or refuse treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine | title = Fertility treatment when the prognosis is very poor or futile | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1194–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19726040 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some assisted reproductive technologies can in fact be harmful to both the mother and child. Posing a psychological and a physical health risk, which may impact the ongoing use of these treatments. The adverse effects may cause for alarm, and they should be tightly regulated to ensure candidates are not only mentally, but physically prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Noah, Lars  | title = Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the Pitfalls of Unregulated Biomedical Innovation | journal = Florida Law Review | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 604–609 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===

====United States====
Many Americans do not have [[health insurance|insurance]] coverage for fertility investigations and treatments. Many states are starting to mandate coverage, and the rate of use is 278% higher in states with complete coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain T, Harlow BL, Hornstein MD |title=Insurance coverage and outcomes of ''in vitro'' fertilization |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=347 |issue=9 |pages=661–6 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12200554 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa013491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some health insurance companies that cover diagnosis of infertility but frequently once diagnosed will not cover any treatment costs.

2005 approximate treatment/diagnosis costs (United States, costs in US$):
* Initial workup: [[hysteroscopy]], [[hysterosalpingogram]], [[blood test]]s ~$2,000
* Sonohysterogram (SHG) ~ $600–$1,000
* Clomiphene citrate cycle ~ $200–$500
* IVF cycle ~ $10,000–$30,000
* Use of a [[surrogate mother]] to carry the child – dependent on arrangements
Another way to look at costs is to determine the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).

For the community as a whole, the cost of IVF on average pays back by 700% by tax from future employment by the conceived human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connolly MP, Pollard MS, Hoorens S, Kaplan BR, Oskowitz SP, Silber SJ |title=Long-term economic benefits attributed to IVF-conceived children: a lifetime tax calculation |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=598–604 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18778175 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=10709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, all patients have the right to preliminary testing, provided free of charge by the [[National Health Service]]. However, treatment is not widely available on the NHS and there can be long waiting lists. Many patients therefore pay for immediate treatment within the NHS or seek help from private clinics.

In 2013, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] published new guidelines about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IVF|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420030919/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines also say women aged between 40 and 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS if all of the following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age. However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.

This policy is often modified by local Clinical Commissioning Groups, in a fairly blatant breach of the [[NHS Constitution for England]] which provides that patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS.  For example, the Cheshire, Merseyside and West Lancashire [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] insists on additional conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Services &amp; how we can help|url=http://www.thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|publisher=Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624054259/http://thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|archivedate=2014-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person undergoing treatment must have commenced treatment before her 40th birthday.
* The person undergoing treatment must have a BMI of between 19 and 29.
* Neither partner must have any living children, from either the current or previous relationships. This includes adopted as well as biological children.
* Sub-fertility must not be the direct result of a sterilisation procedure in either partner (this does not include conditions where sterilisation occurs as a result of another medical problem). Couples who have undertaken a reversal of their sterilisation procedure are not eligible for treatment.

Some treatments are covered by OHIP (public health insurance) in Ontario and others are not. Those with bilaterally blocked fallopian tubes and under 40 have treatment is covered but are still required to pay lab fees (around $3,000–4,000).  Coverage varies in other provinces.  Most other patients are required to pay for treatments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm IVF Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808064341/http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm |date=2009-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Israel's national health insurance, which is mandatory for all Israeli citizens, covers nearly all fertility treatments. IVF costs are fully subsidized up to the birth of two children for all Israeli women, including single women and lesbian couples. Embryo transfers for purposes of gestational surrogacy are also covered.&lt;ref&gt;Teman, Elly. 2010.

On 27 January 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional, that the health insurance companies have to bear only 50% of the cost for IVF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html Zuschüsse der Krankenversicherung für eine künstliche Befruchtung ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208072207/http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-08 }} Retrieved 2. January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2012, the Federal Council has approved a draft law of some federal states, which provides that the federal government provides a subsidy of 25% to the cost. Thus, the share of costs borne for the pair would drop to just 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html Finanzierung künstlicher Befruchtung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219152136/http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-19 }} Retrieved 2.

===Fictional representation===
Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --&gt; Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120703180716/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-21/news/0906190243_1_fertility-treatments-ovulation-artificial-insemination |date=2012-07-03 }} By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter.

''For specific examples, refer to the fiction sections in individual subarticles, e.g. [[Surrogacy#Fictional representation|surrogacy]], [[Sperm donor#Fictional representation|sperm donation]] and [[fertility clinic]].''

In addition, [[reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]] has been present for many decades.

==Research and speculative uses==
The idea of using future ART techniques, including direct human germline engineering technologies, to select and genetically modify embryos for the purpose of [[human enhancement]] has been referred to as '''designer babies''', '''reprogenetics''', and '''liberal eugenics''' and has been discussed since the introduction of [[biotechnology]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon JW |title=Genetic enhancement in humans |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5410 |pages=2023–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10206908 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2023 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.2023G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/embryo-screening-and-the-ethics-of-human-60561 Pray, L.

The term "liberal eugenics" was coined by bioethicist [[Nicholas Agar]].&lt;ref name="Agar 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Nicholas Agar|Agar, Nicholas]]|title = Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement|year = 2004|isbn = 1-4051-2390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=2008 |title=Regulating Eugenics |url= http://harvardlawreview.org/2008/04/regulating-eugenics/ |journal=Harvard Law Review |access-date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal eugenics is aimed at "improving" the genotypes of future generations through screening and genetic modification to eliminate "undesirable" traits.  The term "reprogenetics" was coined by [[Lee M.

'''Bashing''' is a harsh, gratuitous, prejudicial attack on a person, group, or subject. [[Literal and figurative language|Literally]], bashing is a term meaning to hit or assault, but when it is used as a [[Affix|suffix]], or in conjunction with a noun indicating the subject being attacked, it is normally used to imply that the act is motivated by bigotry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically, to describe verbal or critical assaults.  Topics which attract bashing tend to be highly [[partisan (political)|partisan]] and personally sensitive topics for the bashers, the victims, or both. Common areas include [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], and [[politics]].

Physical bashing is differentiated from regular assault because it is a motivated assault, which may be considered a [[hate crime]]. In relation to non-physical bashing, the term is used to imply that a verbal or critical attack is similarly unacceptable and similarly prejudicial. Use of the term in this manner is an [[ad hominem|abusive ad hominem]] action, used to denounce the attack and admonish the attackers by comparing them to perpetrators of physical bashing.

Karen Franklin, in her paper "Psychosocial motivations of hate crimes perpetrators" identifies the following motivations for bashing: socially instilled prejudice or partisan conflict; the perception that the bashing subject is in some way contrary to, or in offense to, an underlying ideology; group or peer influence.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417233212/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf |date=April 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical bashing ==

One of the more common uses of the term ''bashing'' is to describe assault or vilification of people perceived to be [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. Gay-bashing is related to [[homophobia]] and  [[Religion and homosexuality|religious objections to homosexuality]].

==Non-physical bashing==
{{see also|French bashing}}
In cases of non-physical bashing, the term is normally used with the intention of having a pejorative effect on the identified bashers by comparing them to perpetrators of criminal assaults. Sometimes this label is applied to criticisms that are not particularly vehement nor even inappropriate. In these cases, the term can be seen to be applied purely for partisan benefit. The use of the term within this context is most common in editorial or personal commentary. These terms are used to imply that the criticism of these groups or individuals is excessive, too frequent, uncompromising, or inappropriate. Since politics is inherently partisan, the term bashing is frequently used to cast negative aspersions on critics for political gain.

Fans of different artistic works often accuse critics, who may be other fans, of bashing the subject or individuals upon which the fandom is centered. A common example of this on the [[internet]] is ''Lucas bashing'', where the term is used to decry criticism of [[Star Wars]] or [[George Lucas]] personally. In this case, again the motivations include partisan conflict (for or against an aspect of an artistic work); an offense to an underlying ideology (nostalgic attachment to, or immersion in, an artistic genre); and the group influence of other fans and discussion forums. There is also ''character bashing'', which happens when a part of the fandom openly criticises one or more characters in an artistic work, or even real people from media industry.

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

|}

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

[[File:De mulieribus claris - Camiola paga il riscatto di Orlando.jpg|thumb|Miniature from ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', representing Camiola]]
'''Camiola Turinga''' was from [[Messina]] and was known as a virtuous woman. She was the daughter of Lawrence of [[Thuringia]]. She lived in the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the time of the reign of [[Frederick III of Sicily]]. When her husband and parents died she inherited much wealth and was known for handling this large fortune in a moral fashion.

[[Boccaccio]], as a medieval historian and early Renaissance [[archaeology|archaeologist]], describes the events that happened that lead up to her becoming a widow when she was still a young lady. He says in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' in the next to the last biography that when king [[Frederick III of Sicily]] died, his eldest son Peter took over. Right after that time Godfrey of [[Squillace]], commander for king [[Robert of Sicily]], attacked the town of [[Lipari]]. The townspeople were overwhelmed and practically wiped out. Peter then gathered together an army of [[mercenaries]] and volunteer auxiliary troops. He put them into the command of a Count John of Chiaamonte. John's mission was to bring much needed supplies for the starving people of Lipari.

When Godfrey learned that John's army outnumbered his own, he abandoned his camp and left all his supplies there. John then came upon these supplies and took back to the people of Lipari. Then with overconfidence John challenged Godfrey to battle. Godfrey accepted the challenge. He prepared and reinforced his troops overnight and was fully prepared in the morning. John, being overconfident, did not expect Godfrey to attack, assuming instead that he Godfrey would retreat.

Godfrey's men attacked the Sicilians with much vigor. The Sicilians under John's command were stunned with the onslaught. Hand-to-hand combat took place on the Sicilian ships. The Sicilians ultimately lost confidence, since they were not fully prepared for such an attack. They then took whatever ships were still seaworthy and hightailed it. Many of the Sicilian ships were sunk and victory was within grasp for Godfrey. Even though some of John's ships were able to get away, John himself along with some princes and missionaries, were captured. The town of Lipari surrendered and sued for peace.

The prisoners were then taken to [[Naples]] and jailed. Among the prisoners was [[Roland of Sicily]], an illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily]].  Ransom was paid for all the prisoners, and they were all released, except for one - Roland. King Peter hated his brother and all the others under John's command because of their incompetence and how they handled the attack of Godfrey.

Now enters Camiola. She remembers him when they both were children. Rolan was in prison with no hope of getting out. She saw that Peter and his other brothers were willing to let him rot in jail and wished to do something about this. It turned out that there was no legal way of getting him out - except marrying him! She sent secretly to Roland a proposition on this matter. Roland jumped at the opportunity: anything to be able to get out of jail. In fact, that is all he really wanted and would say and promise anything just to get out. Camiola then legally drew up all the necessary documents and arranged for his release. She had to pay two thousand ounces of silver for his release, which was half her wealth. She handed over the agreed amount to gain his release.

Roland was returned to Messina a free man. Immediately he acted like there was no arrangement of a marriage and had no appreciation for his release. Camiola was totally taken off guard because of his attitude and confronted him. She first diplomatically tried an arrangement for the marriage to take place, however Roland would have nothing to do with it.  Ultimately he was brought up in front of an ecclesiastical judge. She proved to the judge that she had a 
legal and binding signed contract for marriage in return for Roland's release out of prison. She showed to the judge that Roland agreed to this and in return was to marry her for his release out of an otherwise hopeless situation of being imprisoned for the rest of his life.

Upon the judge making the decision that Rolan was wrong in not fulfilling his obligation, he admitted to his mistake however still did not want to marry her. His brothers and friends then got involved and convinced Roland that it was the right thing to do. Roland then decided he would marry her and
came to her with this proposal with his friends. She however at this point gave a lengthy speech. From that time forward, she could not be swayed by either the plebs or reprimands from her high moral standards which she had already shown. Roland, however, was scorned by everyone from then on, including his immediate family.

In [[economics]], a '''cardinal utility''' function or scale is a utility index that preserves [[Preference (economics)|preference]] orderings uniquely up to positive [[affine transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="Ellsberg, Daniel 1954"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel |title=Classic and Current Notions of 'Measurable Utility' |journal=Economic Journal |year=1954 |volume=64 |issue=255 |pages=528–556 |doi=10.2307/2227744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strotz |first1=Robert |year=1953 |title=Cardinal Utility |journal=American Economic Review |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=384–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two utility indices are related by an affine transformation if for the value &lt;math&gt;u(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; of one index ''u'', occurring at any quantity &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; of the goods bundle being evaluated, the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;v(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; of the other index ''v'' satisfies a relationship of the form

:&lt;math&gt;v(x_i) = au(x_i) + b\!&lt;/math&gt;,

for fixed constants ''a'' and ''b''. Thus the utility functions themselves are related by

:&lt;math&gt;v(x) = au(x) + b.&lt;/math&gt;

The two indices differ only with respect to scale and origin.&lt;ref name="Ellsberg, Daniel 1954"/&gt; Thus if one is concave, so is the other, in which case there is often said to be [[diminishing marginal utility]].

Thus the use of cardinal utility imposes the assumption that levels of absolute satisfaction exist, so that the magnitudes of increments to satisfaction can be compared across different situations.

The idea of cardinal utility is considered outdated except for specific contexts such as [[expected utility theory|decision making under risk]], [[social welfare function|utilitarian welfare evaluations]], and [[discounted utility|discounted utilities]] for [[intertemporal choice|intertemporal evaluations]] where it is still applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Köbberling |first=Veronika |date=February 2006 |title=Strength of Preference and Cardinal Utility |work=Economic Theory |volume=27 |issue=2 |p=375 |jstor=25056023 |doi=10.1007/s00199-005-0598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, such as in general [[Consumer choice|consumer theory]], [[ordinal utility]] with its weaker assumptions is preferred because results that are just as strong can be derived.

== History ==
The first one to theorize about the marginal value of money was [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. He assumed that the value of an additional amount is inversely proportional to the pecuniary possessions which a person already owns. Since Bernoulli tacitly assumed that an interpersonal measure for the utility reaction of different persons can be discovered, he was then inadvertedly using an early conception of cardinality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kauder |first1=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory: From Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=Economic Journal |date=1953 |volume=63 |issue=251 |page=648 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli's imaginary [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] utility function and Gabriel Cramer's {{math|''U''{{=}}''W&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''}} function were conceived at the time not for a theory of demand but to solve the [[St. Petersburg paradox|St. Petersburg's game]]. Bernoulli assumed that "a poor man generally obtains more utility than a rich man from an equal gain"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samuelson |first1=Paul |title=St. Petersburg Paradoxes: Defanged, Dissected, and Historically Described |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=1977 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=38 |jstor=2722712}}&lt;/ref&gt; an approach that is more profound that the simple mathematical expectation of money as it involves a law of ''moral expectation''.

Early theorists of [[utility]] considered that it had physically quantifiable attributes. They thought that utility behaved like the magnitudes of distance or time, in which the simple use of a ruler or stopwatch resulted in a distinguishable measure. "Utils" was the name actually given to the units in a utility scale.

In the [[Victorian era]] many aspects of life were succumbing to quantification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Peter |date=1996 |title=Against the Gods.

The essential idea in [[utilitarianism]] is to judge people's decisions by looking at their change in utils and measure whether they are better off. The main forerunner of the utilitarian principles since the end of the 18th century was [[Jeremy Bentham]], who believed utility could be measured by some complex introspective examination and that it should guide the design of social policies and laws. For Bentham a scale of pleasure has as a unit of intensity "the degree of intensity possessed by that pleasure which is the faintest of any that can be distinguished to be pleasure";&lt;ref name="Stigler, George 1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=George |date=August 1950 |url=http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/GIACOMO/arquivos/eco02277/stigler-1950.pdf |title=The Development of Utility Theory.

However, neither of them offered solid arguments to support the assumption of measurability. In Jevon's case he added to the later editions of his work a note on the difficulty of estimating utility with accuracy.&lt;ref name="Stigler, George 1950"/&gt; Walras, too, struggled for many years before he could even attempt to formalize the assumption of measurability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaffé |first1=William |title=The Walras-Poincaré Correspondence on the Cardinal Measurability of Utility |journal=Canadian Journal of Economics |date=1977 |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=300 |doi=10.2307/134447 |jstor=134447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was ambiguous about the measurability of hedonism because he adhered to its psychological-hedonistic properties but he also argued that it was "unrealistical" to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinoia |first1=Rozenn |title=That Which is Desired, Which Pleases, and Which Satisfies: Utility According to Alfred Marshall |journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=350 |url=http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Lee/courses/502/reading/mad2.pdf |accessdate=21 May 2015 |doi=10.1080/1042771032000114764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of cardinal utility theory in the 19th century suggested that market prices reflect utility, although they did not say much about their compatibility (i.e., prices being objective while utility is subjective). Accurately measuring subjective [[pleasure]] (or [[pain]]) seemed awkward, as the thinkers of the time were surely aware. They renamed utility in imaginative ways such as ''subjective wealth'', ''overall happiness'', ''moral worth'', ''psychic satisfaction'', or ''ophélimité''. During the second half of the 19th century many studies related to this fictional magnitude&amp;mdash;utility&amp;mdash;were conducted, but the conclusion was always the same: it proved impossible to definitively say whether a good is worth 50, 75, or 125 utils to a person, or to two different people. Moreover, the mere dependence of utility on notions of [[hedonism]] led academic circles to be skeptical of this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=George |date=October 1950 |title=The Development of Utility Theory. II |work=Journal of Political Economy |volume=58 |issue=5 |p=373–396 |jstor=1825710 |doi=10.1086/256980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Edgeworth]] was also aware of the need to ground the theory of utility into the real world. He discussed the quantitative estimates that a person can make of his own pleasure or the pleasure of others, borrowing methods developed in psychology to study hedonic measurement: [[psychophysics]]. This field of psychology was built on work by [[Ernst H. Weber]], but around the time of World War I, psychologists grew discouraged of it.&lt;ref name="Collander, David 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colander |first1=David |date=Spring 2007 |title=Retrospectives: Edgeworth's Hedonimeter and the Quest to Measure Utility |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=215–226 |jstor=30033725 |doi=10.1257/jep.21.2.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N. |title=Happyism |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103952/happyism-deirdre-mccloskey-economics-happiness |work=New Republic |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Carl Menger]] and his followers from the [[Austrian school|Austrian school of economics]] undertook the first successful departure from measurable utility, in the clever form of a theory of ranked uses. Despite abandoning the thought of quantifiable utility (i.e. psychological satisfaction mapped into the set of real numbers) Menger managed to establish a body of hypothesis about decision-making, resting solely on a few axioms of ranked preferences over the possible uses of goods and services. His numerical examples are "illustrative of ordinal, not cardinal, relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stigler |first1=George |title=The Economics of Carl Menger |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=April 1937 |volume=45 |issue=2 |page=240 |jstor=1824519 |doi=10.1086/255042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the 19th century [[neoclassical school of economics|neoclassical economists]] started to embrace alternative ways to deal with the measurability issue. By 1900, [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] was hesitant about accurately measuring pleasure or pain because he thought that such a self-reported subjective magnitude lacked scientific validity. He wanted to find an alternative way to treat utility that did not rely on erratic perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref name="teaching.ust.hk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewin |first1=Shira B. |year=September 1996 |title=Economics and Psychology: Lessons for our Own Day from the Early Twentieth Century |url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~mark329y/EconPsy/Economics%20and%20Psychology%20-%20Lessons%20for%20Our%20Own%20Day%20From%20the%20Early%20Twentieth%20Century.pdf |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=1293–1323 |jstor=2729503 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011071242/http://teaching.ust.hk/~mark329y/EconPsy/Economics%20and%20Psychology%20-%20Lessons%20for%20Our%20Own%20Day%20From%20the%20Early%20Twentieth%20Century.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto's main contribution to ordinal utility was to assume that higher indifference curves have greater utility, but how much greater does not need to be specified to obtain the result of increasing marginal rates of substitution.

The works and manuals of Vilfredo Pareto, Francis Edgeworth, [[Irving Fischer]], and [[Eugene Slutsky]] departed from cardinal utility and served as pivots for others to continue the trend on ordinality. According to Viner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viner |first1=Jacob |year=August 1925 |title=The Utility Concept in Value Theory and its Critics |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=369–387 |doi=10.1086/253690 |jstor=1822522}}&lt;/ref&gt; these economic thinkers came up with a theory that explained the negative slopes of demand curves. Their method avoided the measurability of utility by constructing some abstract [[Indifference curve#Map and properties of indifference curves|indifference curve map]].

During the first three decades of the 20th century, economists from Italy and Russia became familiar with the Paretian idea that utility does not need to be cardinal. According to Schultz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schultz |first1=Henry |title=The Italian School of Mathematical Economics |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 1931 |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=77 |jstor=1821749 |doi=10.1086/254172}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1931 the idea of ordinal utility was not yet embraced by American economists. The breakthrough occurred when a theory of [[ordinal utility]] was put together by [[John Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen|Roy Allen]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=John |last2=Allen |first2=Roy |year=February 1934 |title=A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value |journal=Economica |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=52–76 |doi=10.2307/2548574 |jstor=2548574}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact pages 54–55 from this paper contain the first use ever of the term 'cardinal utility'.&lt;ref name=Mos&gt;{{cite web |last=Moscati |first=Ivan |title=How Cardinal Utility Entered Economic Analysis During the Ordinal Revolution |url=http://eco.uninsubria.it/dipeco/quaderni/files/QF2012_05.pdf |work=Working Paper |publisher=Universita Dell'Insubria Facolta di Economia |date=2012 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatment of a class of utility functions preserved by affine transformations, though, was made in 1934 by Oskar Lange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Oskar |title=The Determinateness of the Utility Function |journal=Review of Economic Studies |date=1934 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=218–225 |doi=10.2307/2967485 |jstor=2967485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Frank Knight argued extensively for cardinal utility. In the decade of 1960 Parducci studied human judgements of magnitudes and suggested a range-frequency theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kornienko |first=Tatiana |date=April 2013 |title=Nature’s Measuring Tape: A Cognitive Basis for Cardinal Utility |publisher=University of Edinburgh |p=3 |url=http://www.gtcenter.org/Archive/2013/Conf/Kornienko1637.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century economists are having a renewed interest in the measurement issues of [[Happiness economics|happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel |last2=Wakker |first2=Peter |last3=Sarin |first3=Rakesh |year=1997 |title=Back to Bentham?

Several properties of Cardinal utility functions can be derived using tools from [[measure theory]] and [[set theory]].

=== Measurability ===
A utility function is considered to be measurable, if the strength of preference or intensity of liking of a good or service is determined with precision by the use of some objective criteria. For example, suppose that eating an apple gives to a person exactly half the pleasure of that of eating an orange. This would be a measurable utility if and only if the test employed for its direct measurement is based on an objective criterion that could let any external observer repeat the results accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernadelli |first1=H. |date=May 1938 |title=The End of the Marginal Utility Theory? |journal=Economica |volume=5 |issue=18 |page=196 |doi=10.2307/2549021 |jstor=2549021}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothetical way to achieve this would be by the use of an [[hedonometer]], which was the instrument suggested by Edgeworth to be capable of registering the height of pleasure experienced by people, diverging according to a law of errors.&lt;ref name="Collander, David 2007"/&gt;

Before the 1930s, the measurability of utility functions was erroneously labeled as cardinality by economists. A different meaning of cardinality was used by economists who followed the formulation of Hicks-Allen. Under this usage, the cardinality of a utility function is simply the mathematical property of uniqueness up to a linear transformation. Around the end of the 1940s, some economists even rushed to argue that von Neumann-Morgenstern axiomatization of expected utility had resurrected measurability.&lt;ref name="teaching.ust.hk"/&gt;

The confusion between cardinality and measurability was not to be solved until the works of Armen Alchian,&lt;ref name="www2.uah.es"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alchian |first1=Armen A. |date=March 1953 |title=The Meaning of Utility Measurement |url=http://www2.uah.es/econ/MicroDoct/Alchian-Utility%20Measurement_1953.pdf |journal=American Economic Review |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=26–50 |jstor=1810289}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Baumol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baumol |first1=William |date=December 1958 |title=The Cardinal Utility Which is Ordinal |journal=Economic Journal |volume=68 |issue=272 |pages=665–672 |doi=10.2307/2227278 |jstor=2227278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Chipman.&lt;ref name="Chipman, John 1960"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chipman |first1=John |date=April 1960 |title=The Foundations of Utility |journal=Econometrica |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=215–216 |doi=10.2307/1907717 |jstor=1907717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of Baumol's paper, "The cardinal utility which is ordinal", expressed well the semantic mess of the literature at the time.

It is helpful to consider the same problem as it appears in the construction of [[level of measurement|scales of measurement]] in the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Roy |date=February 1935 |title=A Note on the Determinateness of the Utility Function |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=155–158 |doi=10.2307/2967563 |jstor=2967563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[temperature]] there are two ''degrees of freedom'' for its measurement - the choice of unit and the zero. Different temperature scales map its intensity in different ways. In the [[celsius scale]] the zero is chosen to be the point where water freezes, and likewise, in cardinal utility theory one would be tempted to think that the choice of zero would correspond to a good or service that brings exactly 0 utils. However this is not necessarily true. The mathematical index remains cardinal, even if the zero gets moved arbitrarily to another point, or if the choice of scale is changed, or if both the scale and the zero are changed. Every measurable entity maps into a cardinal function but not every cardinal function is the result of the mapping of a measurable entity. The point of this example was used to prove that (as with temperature) it is still possible to predict something about the combination of two values of some utility function, even if the utils get transformed into entirely different numbers, as long as it remains a linear transformation.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern stated that the question of measurability of physical quantities was dynamic. For instance, temperature was originally a number only up to any monotone transformation, but the development of the ideal-gas-thermometry led to transformations in which the absolute zero and absolute unit were missing. Subsequent developments of thermodynamics even fixed the absolute zero so that the transformation system in thermodynamics consists only of the multiplication by constants. According to Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944, p.&amp;nbsp;23) "For utility the situation seems to be of a similar nature [to temperature]".

The following quote from Alchian served to clarify once and for all{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the real nature of utility functions, emphasizing that they no longer need to be measurable:

{{quote |text=Can we assign a set of numbers (measures) to the various entities and predict that the entity with the largest assigned number (measure) will be chosen? If so, we could christen this measure "utility" and then assert that choices are made so as to maximize utility. It is an easy step to the statement that "you are maximizing your utility", which says no more than that your choice is predictable according to the size of some assigned numbers. For analytical convenience it is customary to postulate that an individual seeks to maximize something subject to some constraints. The thing -or numerical measure of the "thing"- which he seeks to maximize is called "utility". Whether or not utility is of some kind glow or warmth, or happiness, is here irrelevant; all that counts is that we can assign numbers to entities or conditions which a person can strive to realize. Then we say the individual seeks to maximize some function of those numbers. Unfortunately, the term "utility" has by now acquired so many connotations, that it is difficult to realize that for present purposes utility has no more meaning than this. |author=[[Armen Alchian]] |source=The meaning of utility measurement&lt;ref name="www2.uah.es"/&gt;}}

=== Order of preference ===
{{Details|Preference (economics)}}

In 1955 [[Patrick Suppes]] and Muriel Winet solved the issue of the representability of preferences by a cardinal utility function, and derived the set of axioms and primitive characteristics required for this utility index to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppes |first1=Patrick |first2=Muriel |last2=Winet |date=April 1955 |url=http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/article.html?id=11 |title=An Axiomatization of Utility Based on the Notion of Utility Differences |work=Management Science |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |pp=259–270 |jstor=2627164 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1.3-4.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose an agent is asked to rank his preferences of {{math|''A'' relative to ''B''}} and his preferences of {{math|''B'' relative to ''C''}}. If he finds that he can state, for example, that his degree of preference of {{math|''A'' to ''B''}} exceeds his degree of preference of {{math|''B'' to ''C''}}, we could summarize this information by any triplet of numbers satisfying the two inequalities: {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} were sums of money, the agent could vary the sum of money represented by {{math|''B''}} until he could tell us that he found his degree of preference of {{math|''A''}} over the revised amount {{math|''B' ''}} equal to his degree of preference of {{math|''B' ''}} over {{math|''C''}}. If he finds such a {{math|''B'''}}, then the results of this last operation would be expressed by any triplet of numbers satisfying the relationships: (a) {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, and (b) {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;''}} = {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;B'&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Any two triplets obeying these relationships must be related by a linear transformation; they represent utility indices differing only by scale and origin. In this case, "cardinality" means nothing more being able to give consistent answers to these particular questions. Note that this experiment does not require measurability of utility. [[Itzhak Gilboa]] gives a sound explanation of why measurability can never be attained solely by [[introspection]]:

{{quote |text=It might have happened to you that you were carrying a pile of papers, or clothes, and didn't notice that you dropped a few. The decrease in the total weight you were carrying was probably not large enough for you to notice. Two objects may be too close in terms of weight for us to notice the difference between them. This problem is common to perception in all our senses. If I ask whether two rods are of the same length or not, there are differences that will be too small for you to notice. The same would apply to your perception of sound (volume, pitch), light, temperature, and so forth... |author=Itzhak Gilboa |source=Theory of decision under uncertainty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilboa |first=Itzhak |date=2009 |url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~kmkj/uncertainty/Gilboa_Lecture_Notes.pdf |title=Theory of Decision under Uncertainty |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-1077-8251-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this view, those situations where a person just cannot tell the difference between {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} will lead to indifference not because of a consistency of preferences, but because of a misperception of the senses. Moreover, human senses adapt to a given level of stimulation and then register changes from that baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poundstone |first=William |date=2010 |title=Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It) |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |p=39 |isbn=978-1-4299-4393-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWjTZhw1MiUC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Suppose a certain agent has a preference ordering over random outcomes (lotteries). If the agent can be queried about his preferences, it is possible to construct a cardinal utility function that represents these preferences. This is the core of the [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem#construction|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]].

== Applications ==

===Welfare economics===
Among welfare economists of the utilitarist school it has been the general tendency to take satisfaction (in some cases, pleasure) as the unit of welfare. If the function of welfare economics is to contribute data which will serve the social philosopher or the statesman in the making of welfare judgements, this tendency leads perhaps, to a hedonistic ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viner |first1=Jacob |date=December 1925 |title=The Utility Concept in Value Theory and Its Critics II |work=Journal of Political Economy |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=638–659 |doi=10.1086/253725 |jstor=1822261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this framework, actions (including production of goods and provision of services) are judged by their contributions to the subjective wealth of people. In other words, it provides a way of judging the "greatest good to the greatest number of persons". An act that reduces one person's utility by 75 utils while increasing two others' by 50 utils each has increased overall utility by 25 utils and is thus a positive contribution; one that costs the first person 125 utils while giving the same 50 each to two other people has resulted in a net loss of 25 utils.

If a class of utility functions is cardinal, intrapersonal comparisons of utility differences are allowed. If, in addition, some comparisons of utility are meaningful interpersonally, the linear transformations used to produce the class of utility functions must be restricted across people. An example is cardinal unit comparability. In that information environment, admissible transformations are increasing affine functions and, in addition, the scaling factor must be the same for everyone. This information assumption allows for interpersonal comparisons of utility differences, but utility levels cannot be compared interpersonally because the intercept of the affine transformations may differ across people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackorby |first1=Charles |last2=Bossert |first2=Walter |last3=Donaldson |first3=David |title=Utilitarianism and the Theory of Justice |editor1-last=Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth |editor2-last=Sen |editor2-first=Amartya |editor3-last=Suzumura |editor3-first=Kotaru |work=Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare |date=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-82914-6 |page=552 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rh10cOpltLsC&amp;pg=PA552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marginalism ===
{{Details|Marginal utility}} 
*Under cardinal utility theory, the ''sign'' of the marginal utility of a good is the same for all the numerical representations of a particular preference structure.
*The ''magnitude'' of the marginal utility is not the same for all cardinal utility indices representing the same specific preference structure.
*The ''sign'' of the second [[derivative]] of a differentiable utility function that is cardinal, is the same for all the numerical representations of a particular preference structure. Given that this is usually a negative sign, there is room for a ''law of diminishing marginal utility'' in cardinal utility theory.
*The ''magnitude'' of the second derivative of a differentiable utility function is not the same for all cardinal utility indices representing the same specific preference structure.

=== Expected utility theory ===
{{Details|Expected utility theory}}
This type of indices involves choices under risk. In this case, {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}}, are [[Lottery (probability)|lotteries]] associated with outcomes. Unlike cardinal utility theory under certainty, in which the possibility of moving from preferences to quantified utility was almost trivial, here it is paramount to be able to map preferences into the set of real numbers, so that the operation of mathematical expectation can be executed. Once the mapping is done, the introduction of additional assumptions would result in a consistent behavior of people regarding fair bets. But fair bets are, by definition, the result of comparing a gamble with an expected value of zero to some other gamble. Although it is impossible to model attitudes toward risk if one doesn't quantify utility, the theory should not be interpreted as measuring strength of preference under certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoemaker |first=Paul |date=June 1982 |title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=529–563 |jstor=2724488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of the utility function===

Suppose that certain outcomes are associated with three states of nature, so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is preferred over ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which in turn is preferred over ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; this set of outcomes, {{math|''X''}}, can be assumed to be a calculable money-prize in a controlled game of chance, unique up to one positive proportionality factor depending on the currency unit.

Let {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be two lotteries with probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively being

:&lt;math&gt;L_1 =(0.6, 0, 0.4),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_2 =(0,1,0)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that someone has the following preference structure under risk:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1} \succ L_{2},&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is preferred over ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. By modifying the values of {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, eventually there will be some appropriate values ({{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;1'&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) for which she is found to be indifferent between it and {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;mdash;for example

:&lt;math&gt;L_{1}' =(0.5, 0, 0.5).&lt;/math&gt;

Expected utility theory tells us that

:&lt;math&gt;EU(L_{1}') = EU(L_2)\!&lt;/math&gt;

and so

:&lt;math&gt;(0.5)*u(x_1)+(0.5)*u(x_{3})=1*u(x_{2}).&lt;/math&gt;

In this example from Majumdar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majumdar |first1=Tapas |date=February 1958 |title=Behaviourist Cardinalism in Utility Theory |journal=Economica |volume=25 |issue=97 |pages=26–33 |doi=10.2307/2550691 |jstor=2550691}}&lt;/ref&gt; fixing the zero value of the utility index such that the utility of {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is 0, and by choosing the scale so that the utility of {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} equals 1, gives

:&lt;math&gt;(0.5)*u(x_{3})=1.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x_{3}) = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Intertemporal utility===
{{Details|Intertemporal choice}}
Models of utility with several periods, in which people discount future values of utility, need to employ cardinalism in order to have well-behaved utility functions. According to Paul Samuelson the maximization of the discounted sum of future utilities implies that a person can rank utility differences.{{sfnp|Moscati|2012|p=20}}

==Controversies==
Some authors have commented on the misleading nature of the terms "cardinal utility" and "ordinal utility", as used in economic jargon:

{{quote |text=These terms, which seem to have been introduced by Hicks and Allen (1934), bear scant if any relation to the mathematicians' concept of ordinal and cardinal numbers; rather they are euphemisms for the concepts of order-homomorphism to the real numbers and group-homomorphism to the real numbers. |author=John Chipman |source=The foundations of utility&lt;ref name="Chipman, John 1960"/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There remain economists who believe that utility, if it cannot be measured, at least can be approximated somewhat to provide some form of measurement, similar to how prices, which have no uniform unit to provide an actual price level, could still be indexed to provide an "inflation rate" (which is actually a level of change in the prices of weighted indexed products). These measures are not perfect but can act as a proxy for the utility. Lancaster's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lancaster |first1=Kelvin |date=April 1966 |title=A New Approach to Consumer Theory |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=132–157 |doi=10.1086/259131 |jstor=1828835}}&lt;/ref&gt; characteristics approach to consumer demand illustrates this point.

'''Conflict''' refers to some form of friction, or discord arising within a group when the beliefs or actions of one or more members of the group are either resisted by or unacceptable to one or more members of another group.
Conflict can arise between members of the same group, known as [[intragroup conflict]], or it can occur between members of two or more groups, and involve violence, interpersonal discord conflict.
Conflict in groups often follows a specific course. ''Routine group interaction'' is first disrupted by an ''initial conflict'', often caused by differences of opinion, disagreements between members, or scarcity of resources. At this point, the group is no longer united, and may split into coalitions. This period of ''conflict escalation'' in some cases gives way to a ''conflict resolution stage'', after which the group can eventually return to ''routine group interaction

==Definitions==
M.Ajit notes there is no single universally accepted definition of conflict.&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-15"/&gt; He notes that one issue of contention is whether the conflict is a [[scenario|situation]] or a type of [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-16"/&gt;

Citing a review of definitions of [[organizational conflict]]s in 1990 by [[Robert A. Baron]],&lt;ref name="MurphySaal1990"/&gt; Rakhim notes the following common elements in the definitions of conflict:&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-16"/&gt;
* there are recognized opposing interests between parties in a [[zero-sum]] situation;
* there must be a [[belief]] by each side that the other one is acting or will act against them;
* this belief is likely to be justified by actions taken;
* conflict is a process, having developed from their past [[interaction]]s;
Building on that, the proposed definition of conflict by Rakhim  is "an interactive process manifested in incompatibility, disagreement or dissonance within or between [[social entity|social entities]]."&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-16"/&gt; Rakhim also notes that a conflict may be limited to one individual, who is conflicted within himself (the intrapersonal conflict).&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-16"/&gt;

To take another definition of conflict, [[Michael Nicholson]] defines it as an activity which takes place when conscious beings (individuals or groups) wish to carry out mutually inconsistent acts concerning their wants, needs or obligations.&lt;ref name="Nicholson1992-11"/&gt; Conflict is an escalation of a [[disagreement]], which is its common prerequisite, and is characterized by the existence of conflict behavior, in which the beings are actively trying to damage one another.&lt;ref name="Nicholson1992-12-13"/&gt; Rakhim lists some manifestations of conflict behavior, starting with disagreement, and followed by verbal abuse and interference.&lt;ref name="Rahim2010-17"/&gt;

Conflicts can occur between individuals, groups and organizations; examples include [[Argument|quarrels]] between individuals, [[labor strike]]s, [[competitive sport]]s, or [[armed conflict]]s.&lt;ref name="Nicholson1992-13"/&gt;

==Role of emotion in inter-group relations==

A key player in inter-group relations and conflict is the collective sentiment a person’s own group (in-group) feels toward another group (out-group). These intergroup emotions are usually negative, and range in intensity from feelings of discomfort when interacting with a member of a certain other group to full on hatred for another group and its members.  For example, in [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer's] organisational research at the [[University of Oxford]], inter-group conflict was so 'heated' that it became mutually destructive and intractable, resulting in organizational collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out-group-directed emotions can be expressed both verbally and non-verbally, and according to the stereotype content model, are dictated by two dimensions: the perceived warmth (How friendly and sincere is the other group?) and competence of the other group (How skillful is the other group?). Depending on the perceived degree of warmth and competence, the stereotype content model predicts four basic emotions that could be directed toward the out-group (Forsyth, 2006).
# '''Envy'''- Results when the out-group is perceived to have high competence, but low warmth (Cuddy, Fiske &amp; Glick, 2007). Envious groups are usually jealous of another group’s symbolic and tangible achievements and view that group as competition (Forsyth, 2006).
# '''Contempt'''- The out-group is taken to be low in both competence and warmth (Cuddy, Fiske &amp; Glick, 2007). According to Forsyth, contempt is one of the most frequent intergroup emotions. In this situation, the out-group is held responsible for its own failures. In-group members also believe that their conflict with the out-group can never be resolved (Forsyth, 2006).
# '''Pity'''- Out-groups that are believed by the in-group to be high in warmth but low in competence are pitied (Cuddy, Fiske &amp; Glick, 2007). Usually pitied groups are lower in status than the in-group, and are not believed to be responsible for their failures (Forsyth, 2006).
# '''Admiration'''- Admiration occurs when an out-group is taken to be high in both warmth and competence, however admiration is very rare because these two conditions are seldom met (Cuddy, Fiske &amp; Glick, 2007). An admired out-group is thought to be completely deserving  of its accomplishments. Admiration is thought to be most likely to arise when a member of the in-group can take pride in the accomplishments of the out-group, and when the out-group achieving does not interfere with the in-group (Forsyth, 2006).

==Types==
Conflict is rarely seen as constructive; however, in certain contexts (such as competition in sports), moderate levels of conflict can be seen as being mutually beneficial, facilitating understanding, tolerance, learning, and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Jowett2007"/&gt; [[Sophia Jowett]] differentiates between content conflict, where individuals disagree about how to deal with a certain issue, and relational conflict, where individuals disagree about one another, noting that the content conflict can be beneficial, increasing motivation and stimulating discussion, whereas the relational conflicts decreases performance, loyalty, satisfaction and commitment, and causes individuals to be irritable, negative and suspicious.&lt;ref name="Jowett2007"/&gt;  [[Irving Janis]] proposed that conflict is beneficial in groups and committees to avoid the [[Cognitive bias|error]] of "[[group think]]".&lt;ref name=Janis1971&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janis |first=I. L.|title=Groupthink |journal=Psychology Today|date=November 1971|volume=5|issue=6|pages=43–46, 74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehn and Mannix have proposed a division of conflicts into three types: relationship, task, and process.&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt; Relationship conflict stems from interpersonal incompatibilities; task conflict is related to disagreements in viewpoints and opinion about a particular task, and process conflict refers to disagreement over the group’s approach to the task, its methods, and its group process.&lt;ref name=jm/&gt; They note that although relationship conflict and process conflict are harmful, task conflict is found to be beneficial since it encourages diversity of opinions, although care should be taken so it does not develop into process or relationship conflict.&lt;ref name=jm/&gt;

Task conflict has been associated with two interrelated and beneficial effects. The first is group decision quality. Task conflict encourages greater cognitive understanding of the issue being discussed. This leads to better decision making for the groups that use task conflict.

The second is affective acceptance of group decisions. Task conflict can lead to increased satisfaction with the group decision and a desire to stay in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fagbokforlaget.no/boker/downloadpsykorg/KAP13/artikler/Toppledelse%20og%20konflikt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124011117/http://fagbokforlaget.no/boker/downloadpsykorg/KAP13/artikler/Toppledelse%20og%20konflikt.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amason and Sapienza in turn differentiate between affective and cognitive conflict, where cognitive conflict is task-oriented and arises from differences in perspective or judgment, and affective conflict is emotional and arises from personal differences and disputes.&lt;ref name="The Effects of Top Management Team Size and interaction Norms on Cognitive and Affective Conflict"/&gt;

==Five beliefs that propel groups toward conflict==

Roy Eidelson and Judy Eidelson (2003) investigated some of the important roles that beliefs may play in triggering or constraining conflict between groups. On the basis of a review of relevant literature, five belief domains stand out as especially noteworthy: Superiority, injustice, vulnerability, distrust and helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eidelson|first=Roy, J|author2=Eidelson, Judy I|title=Dangerous ideas: Five beliefs that propel groups toward conflict|journal=American Psychologist|year=2003|volume=58|issue=3|pages=182–192|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.3.182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Superiority
:'''Individual-level core belief:''' This core belief revolves around a person's enduring conviction that he or she is better than other people in important ways. The cluster of attitudes commonly associated with this belief includes a sense of specialness, deservingness, and entitlement.
:'''Group-level worldview:''' Many of these elements are also present in the superiority worldview at the group level. This worldview encompasses shared convictions of moral superiority, chosenness, entitlement and special destiny. Several joint working committees of the American Psychological Association have identified "belief in the superiority of one group's cultural heritage (history, values, language, traditions, arts and crafts, etc.) over another's as a defining characteristic of the phenomenon they termed ''ethnocentric monoculturalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sue|first=Derald Wing|author2=Bingham, Rosie P. |author3=Porché-Burke, Lisa |author4=Vasquez, Melba |title=The diversification of psychology: A multicultural revolution|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|issue=12|pages=1061–1069|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.12.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Injustice
:'''Individual-level core belief:''' The perceived mistreatment by specific others or by the world at large. This mindset can lead the individual to identify something as unfair which is merely unfortunate, and thereby to inappropriately engage in retaliatory acts.
:'''Group-level worldview:''' The injustice worldview reflects the in-groups conviction that it has significant and legitimate grievances against another group. This mindset can mobilize powerful and violent collective insurgencies, especially because shared perceptions of injustice typically heighten the identification and allegiance that individuals feel towards their group. Further, these assessments of mistreatment are particularly common across cultural divides because different cultures tend to have different definitions for what constitutes justice, and different norms for how it should be achieved.

3. Vulnerability
:'''Individual-level core belief:''' The vulnerability core belief revolves around a person's conviction that he or she s perpetually living in harm's way. Vulnerability involves a person's perception of him or herself as subject to internal or external dangers over which control is lacking, or is insufficient to afford him or her a sense of safety.
:'''Group-level worldview:''' Important parallels to this individual-level core belief are present in a collective vulnerability worldview that again appears to be widespread among ethnic groups. Fears about the future are the most common cause of ethnic conflicts and often produce spiralling violence. The vulnerability worldview is catastrophic thinking in which a group's imagined worst case scenarios take on the inexorable logic of inevitability.

4. Distrust
:'''Individual-level core belief:''' This core belief focuses on the presumed hostility and malign intent of others. The critical role played by issues of trust in individual psychological development has long been recognized. The expectation that others will hurt, abuse, humiliate, cheat, lie, or take advantage usually involves the perception that harm is intentional or the result of unjustified and extreme negligence. People who consistently assume the worst about the intentions of others prevent truly collaborative relationships from developing.
:'''Group-level worldview:''' As an extension of this individual-level core belief to larger groups. the distrust worldview focuses specifically on perceptions of out groups and revolves around beliefs that the other is untrustworthy and harbors malign intentions toward the in-group.

5. Helplessness
:'''Individual-level core belief:''' The conviction that even carefully planned and executed actions will fail to produce desired outcomes. In some cases, the individual may perceive him or herself as lacking the ability necessary to attain a goal. Regardless of the extent to which helplessness is a matter of distorted perception or objective reality, this core belief tends to be self-perpetuating because it diminishes motivation.
:'''Group-level worldview:''' The helplessness worldview describes a collective mindset of powerlessness and dependency. The extent to which a group perceives itself as helpless reflects assessments not only of its capabilities, but also of whether the environment is rich or poor in opportunities for group advancement.

== Conflict escalation ==
Although the involved parties may hope to reach a solution to their dispute quickly, psychological and interpersonal factors can frustrate their attempts to control the conflict, and in this case, [[conflict escalation]] occurs. A number of factors including increased commitment to one's position, use of harder influence tactics, and formation of coalitions propel the escalation of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010). ''Group Dynamics'' (5th Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty and commitment ===
As conflicts escalate, group members' doubts and uncertainties are replaced with a firm commitment to their position. People rationalize their choices once they have made them: they seek out information that supports their views, reject information that disconfirms their views, and become more entrenched in their original position (also see [[Confirmation bias|confirmatory bias]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L., &amp; Ward, A. (1995). Naïve Realism in Everyday Life: Implications of Social Conflict and Misunderstanding. In T. Brown, E.S. Reed, &amp; E. Turiel (Eds.), ''Values and Knowledge'' (pp. 103-135). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, people believe that once they commit to a position publicly, they should stick with it. Sometimes, they may realize the shortcomings of their views, but they continue defending those views and arguing against their opponents just to save face.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. C. (1992). ''A Strategy of Change''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, if the opponents argue too strongly, reactance may set in and group members become even more committed to the position.&lt;ref&gt;Brehm, S. S., &amp; Brehm, J. W. (1981). ''Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curhan, J.R., Neale, M.A., &amp; Ross, L. (2004). Dynamic valuation: Preference changes in the context of face-to-face negotiations. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40,'' 142-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception and misperception ===
Individuals' reactions to the conflict are shaped by their perception of the situation and people in the situation. During the conflict, opponents' inferences about each other's strengths, attitudes, values, and personal qualities tend to be largely distorted.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, L., &amp; Nadler, J. (2000). Judgmental biases in conflict resolution and how to overcome them. In M. Deutsch, &amp; P. Coleman (Eds.), ''Handbook of constructive conflict resolution: theory and practice ''(pp. 213-235).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misattribution ===
During the conflict, people explain their opponents' actions in ways that make the problem worse. [[Fundamental attribution error]] occurs when one assumes that opponents' behavior was caused by personal (dispositional) rather than situational (environmental) factors.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (vol. 10). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When conflict continues for a while, opponents might decide that this conflict is intractable. People usually expect intractable conflicts to be prolonged, intense, and very hard to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Tal, D. (2007). ''Living with the conflict: Socio-psychological analysis of the Israeli-Jewish society.'' Jerusalem: Carmel. (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misperceiving motivations ===
During the conflict, opponents often become mistrustful of one another wondering if their cooperative motivations were replaced by competitive ones. This loss of trust makes it difficult to return to the cooperative relationship. People with competitive [[Social value orientations|SVO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the most inaccurate in their perception of opponents' motivation. They often think that others compete with them when in fact, there is no competition going on.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, D. N., &amp; Kerr, N. L. (1991). Might versus morality explored: Motivational and cognitive bases for social motives. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 756–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors are also more biased in their search for information that confirms their suspicions that others compete with them.&lt;ref&gt;Van Kleef, G. A., &amp; De Dreu, C. K. W. (2002). Social value orientation and impression formation: A test of two competing hypotheses about information search in negotiation. ''International Journal of Conflict Management, 13'', 59-77.&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to deliberately misrepresent their intentions, sometimes claiming to be more cooperatively oriented than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Steinel, W., and De Dreu, C. K. W. (2004). Social motives and strategic misrepresentation in social decision making. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86,'' 419–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soft tactics and hard tactics ===
People use soft tactics at the outset of the conflict, but as it escalates, tactics become stronger and harder. To demonstrate this phenomenon, Mikolic, Parker, and Pruitt (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Mikolic, J. M., Parker, J. C., &amp; Pruitt, D. G. (1997). Escalation in response to persistent annoyance: Groups versus individuals and gender effects. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72,'' 151-163.&lt;/ref&gt; simulated a conflict situation by creating a "birthday card factory" with study participants who were paid a small amount for each card they manufactured using paper, colored markers, and ribbons. The work went well until researchers' confederate who posed as another participant started hoarding production materials. Initially, group members tried to solve the problem with statements and requests. When these methods failed they shifted to demands and complaints, and then to threats, abuse, and anger.

Although hard tactics can overwhelm the opponent, they often intensify conflicts. Morton Deutsch and Robert Krauss (1960)&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M., &amp; Krauss, R.M. (1960). The effect of threat upon interpersonal bargaining. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 61,'' 181-189.&lt;/ref&gt; used trucking game experiment to demonstrate that capacity to threaten others intensifies conflict. They also showed that establishing a communication link does not always help to solve the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, R. M., &amp; Morsella, E. (2000/2007). Communication and conflict. In M. Deutsch &amp; P. T. Coleman (Eds.), ''The Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice'' (pp. 131-143). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; If one party threatens the other, the threatened party will fare best if it cannot respond with a counterthreat.&lt;ref&gt;Borah, L.A., Jr. (1963). The effects of threat in bargaining: Critical and experimental analysis. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 66,'' 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, P. S. (1966). Effects of increased incentives upon the use of threat in bargaining. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 4,'' 14-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally powerful opponents, however, learn to avoid the use of power if the fear of retaliation is high.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. J., Ford, R. S., &amp; Blegen, M. A. (1988). Coercive capability in conflict: A test of bilateral deterrence versus conflict spiral theory. ''Social Psychology Quarterly, 51''(2), 93–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reciprocity and upward conflict spiral ===
In many cases, upward conflict spirals are sustained by the norms of reciprocity: if one group or person criticizes the other, the criticized person or group feels justified in doing the same. In conflict situations, opponents often follow the norm of rough reciprocity, i.e. they give too much (overmatching) or too little (undermatching) in return. At low levels of conflict, opponents overmatch their threats, while at high levels of conflict they undermatch their threats. Overmatching may serve as a strong warning, while undermatching may be used to send conciliatory messages.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, G. A., Jr. (1986). Patterns of threat and punishment reciprocity in a conflict setting. ''Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 51'', 541-546.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Few and many ===
When conflicts erupt, group members use coalitions to shift the balance of power in their favor, and it is typical for multiparty conflicts to reduce to two-party blocks over time. Coalitions contribute to the conflict because they draw more members of the group into the affray.  Individuals in coalitions work not only to ensure their own outcomes but also to worsen outcomes of non-coalition members. Those who are excluded from the coalition react with hostility and try to regain power by forming their own coalition. Thus, coalitions need to be constantly maintained through strategic bargaining and negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Mannix, E. A. (1993). Organizations as resource dilemmas: The effects of power balance on coalition formation in small groups. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 55,'' 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irritation and anger ===
It is generally difficult for most people to remain calm and collected in a conflict situation. However, an increase in negative emotions (i.e. anger) only exacerbates the initial conflict. Even when group members begin to discuss their positions calmly and dispassionately, once they become committed to their positions, an emotional expression often replaces logical discussion.&lt;ref&gt;De Dreu, C. K. W., Beersma, B., Steinel, W., &amp; Van Kleef, G. A. (2007). The psychology of negotiation: Principles and basic processes. In A. W. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles'' (2nd ed. pp. 608–629). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is also contagious: when group member negotiates with someone who is angry, they become angry themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Van Kleef, G. A., De Dreu, C. K. W., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2004). The interpersonal effects of emotions in negotiations: A motivated information processing approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, ''510-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution==
{{main article|Conflict resolution}}
Nicholson notes that a conflict is resolved when the inconsistency between wishes and actions of parties is resolved.&lt;ref name="Nicholson1992-13"/&gt; [[Negotiation]] is an important part of conflict resolution, and any design of a process which tries to incorporate positive conflict from the start needs to be cautious not to let it degenerate into the negative types of conflict.&lt;ref name="Jowett2007"/&gt;

===Conflict mediation===

Conflict is a social process that is exacerbated when individual members of a group take sides in the debate. Among the methods to resolve conflict is [[mediation]] of the dispute by a group member not currently involved in the dispute. More specifically, a mediator is defined as a person who attempts to resolve a conflict between two group members by intervening in this conflict. Put simply, the mediator can be thought of as a disinterested guide directs the disputants through the process of developing a solution to a disagreement (Forsyth, 2006).

Although the tendency will be for group members who are uninvolved in the dispute to remain uninvolved,  in some cases, the sheer intensity of the conflict may escalate to the point where mediation is unavoidable. Third party mediation of the conflict opens avenues for communication between group members in conflict. It allows members to express their opinions and request clarification of other member’s standpoints while the mediator acts as a form of protection against any shame or “loss of face” that either disputant may experience. This can be done by shedding a positive light on the reconciliation that was made during the mediation process. For instance, if it was negotiated that two cashiers will rotate the weekends they work, the mediator might point out that now each worker gets a weekend off every two weeks (Forsyth, 2006).

The mediator can also offer assistance in refining solutions and making counter-offers between members, adjusting the time and location of meetings so that they are mutually satisfying for both parties (Forsyth, 2006).

According to Forsyth (2006), there are three major mediation approaches:
Inquisitorial procedure- Using this procedure, the mediator asks each of the disputants a series of questions, considers the two sets of responses, and then selects and imposes a mandatory solution on the members. The inquisitorial procedure is the least popular approach to mediation.

Arbitration- Here, mediation involves the two disputants explaining their arguments to the mediator, who creates a solution based on the arguments presented. Arbitration is best for low intensity conflict, but is the most favored mediation style overall.

Moot- The moot approach involves an open discussion  between disputants and the mediator about the problems and potential solutions. In the moot approach, the mediator cannot impose a mandatory solution. After arbitration, a moot is the most preferred mediation style.

In practice, conflict resolution is often interwoven with daily activities, as in organizations, workplaces and institutions. Staff and residents in a youth care setting, for instance, interweave everyday concerns (meals, lessons, breaks, meetings, or other mundane but concerted projects) with interpersonal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;http://jce.sagepub.com/content/40/1/39.short Wästerfors, David (2011) "Disputes and Going Concerns" ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' (40) 1: 39-70&lt;/ref&gt;[http://skdrustvo.blogspot.rs/2017/01/conflicts-and-way-to-resolve-them.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5380">A '''courtesy book''' or '''book of manners''' was a book dealing with issues of [[etiquette]], behaviour and morals, with a particular focus on the life at princely [[Court (royal)|courts]]. Courtesy literature can be traced back to 13th century German and Italian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|contribution=courtesy literature
|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online
|year=2008
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-literature}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
Courtesy books formed part of the didactic literature of the Middle Ages, covering topics from religion and ethics to social awareness and social conduct.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Kline ed., ''Medieval Literature for Children'' (2012) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; While firmly normative in their bent, they also showed an awareness of the human realities that did not fit neatly under the rubric of their precepts.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Kline ed., ''Medieval Literature for Children'' (2012) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Such books appealed both to an aristocratic readership and to aspiring urban middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Ashley/M. D. Johnston eds., ''Medieval Conduct Books'' (2009) p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known courtesy book from Germany is the mid-thirteenth century ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' Book of Manners.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke,2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the oldest known courtesy books of Germany, is the learning-poems of "[[Winsbecke]]" and "[[Winsbeckin]]", written around 1220 by an anonymous author. 

The oldest known courtesy book from Italy is the 1215/16 ''Der Wälsche Gast'' by [[Thomasin von Zirclaere]], speaking to a German audience.

==Renaissance==
The Renaissance saw the re-emergence of urban civilisation in the Italian city-states, drawing on the earlier urban civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, but developing new ideals of manners and courtesy. Three sixteenth century Italian texts on courtly manners and morals – [[Baldassarre Castiglione]]'s ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' (1528); [[Giovanni della Casa|Giovanni della Casa's]] ''[[Il Galateo]]'' (1558) and [[Stefano Guazzo|Stefano Guazzo's]] ''[[La Civil Conversazione]]'' (1574) in four volumes – had an especially wide influence both south and north of the Alps.  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], apparently had at his bedside three books: the [[Bible]], [[Nicolò Machiavelli|Nicolò Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Prince]]'', and ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' (''The Courtier '').&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, ''Civilisation'' (1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Through Castiglione's writings, the Italian ideals of Neo-Platonism, beauty and symmetry, and the amateur author, reached a wide humanist audience,&lt;ref&gt;B. Ford ed., ''The Age of Shakespeare'' (1973) pp. 23, 91, and 131&lt;/ref&gt; as did the new Italianate emphasis on the self in society and the importance of social appearances.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Wolberg, ''"All Possible Art"'' (2008) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms for [[personal boundaries]] and social [[proxemics]] established by figures such as della Casa still influence the Western world almost a half millennium later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (1971) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===English translations and developments===

In 1561, [[Thomas Hoby]] published ''The Courtyer'', his translation of ''Il Cortegiano'', (although he had made the translation a decade earlier). The work was read widely and influenced the writings of [[Shakespeare]], [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Robert Peterson's translation of ''Il Galateo'' appeared in 1576. [[George Pettie]] translated the first three books of Guazzo's work into ''The Civil Conversation'' in 1581; the fourth and last volume from ''La Civil Conversazione'' appeared five years later in a translation by [[Bartholomew Yonge]]. 

A well-known English example of the genre is [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]]'s ''The Compleat Gentleman'' of 1622.&lt;ref name=ocel&gt;See the articles "Courtesy Literature" and "Hoby" in

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
Courtesy books continued to be written into the 1700s, the last traditional English one being [[Lord Chesterfield]]'s ''Letters to His Son''&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; – memorably described by [[Samuel Johnson]] as teaching "the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing-master".&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'' (Penguin 1984) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; However they took on a new form in the fiction of the time, much of it (like the work of [[Sir Charles Grandison]]) filling a similar normative role.&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Marks, ''Sir Charles Grandison'' (1986) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''diplomatic gift''' is a [[gift]] given by a [[diplomat]], politician or leader when visiting a foreign country. Usually the gift is reciprocated by the host. The use of diplomatic gifts dates back to the ancient world and givers have competed to outdo each other in the lavishness of their gifts. Examples include silks given to the West by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in the [[early Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=Muth&gt;"Silken diplomacy" by Anna Muthesius in Shepard J. &amp; Franklin, Simon.

==Missteps==
Diplomatic gifts have the potential to seal international friendships, but also to be rebuffed, to seem mismatched, or to accidentally send the wrong message.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">'''Contrast''' in [[visual perception]] is the difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). 

'''Contrast''' in [[physics]] is a quantity intended to correlate with the perceived [[brightness]] contrast, usually defined by one of a number of formulae (see below) which involve e.g. the [[luminance]]s of the stimuli considered, for example: ΔL/L near the luminance threshold (known as Weber contrast&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Weber_and_contrast_ratio.html Charles Poynton on Weber contrast]&lt;/ref&gt;), or L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; for much higher luminances.&lt;ref&gt;IEC(50)845-02-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contrast''' can also be due to differences of [[chromaticity]] specified by colorimetric characteristics (e.g. the [[color difference]] ΔE CIE 1976 UCS).

Visual [[information]] is always contained in some kind of visual contrast{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}, thus '''contrast''' is an essential performance feature of [[electronic visual display]]s.

The '''contrast''' of electronic visual displays depends on the electrical driving (analog or digital input signal), on the ambient illumination and on the direction of observation (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). 

==Luminance contrast==

The "luminance contrast" is the ratio between the higher luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, and the lower luminance, L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, that define the feature to be detected. This ratio, often called '''contrast ratio''', CR, (actually being a [[luminance]] [[ratio]]), is often used for high luminances and for specification of the [[contrast ratio|contrast]] of [[electronic visual display]] devices. The luminance contrast (ratio), CR, is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]], often indicated by adding ":1" to the value of the quotient (e.g. CR = 900:1).

&lt;math&gt;CR = \frac{L_H}{L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 1 ≤ CR ≤ &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

A "contrast ratio" of CR = 1 means no contrast.

The contrast can also be specified by the '''contrast modulation''' (or '''Michelson contrast'''), C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C_M = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H+L_L}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1.

C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 means no contrast.

Another contrast definition sometimes found in the electronic displays field, K, is:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{L_H -L_L}{L_H}&lt;/math&gt; with 0 ≤ K ≤ 1.

K = 0 means no contrast, the maximum possible contrast, K&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; equals one.

==Color contrast==

Two parts of a [[visual field]] can be of equal luminance, but their color ([[chromaticity]]) is different. Such a ''color contrast'' can be described by a distance in a suitable chromaticity system (e.g. CIE 1976 UCS, [[Lab color space|CIELAB]], CIELUV). 

A metric for ''color contrast'' often used in the electronic displays field is the [[color difference]] ΔE*uv or ΔE*ab.

==Full-screen contrast==

During measurement of the luminance values used for evaluation of the contrast, the active area of the display screen is often completely set to one of the optical states for which the contrast is to be determined, e.g. completely white (R=G=B=100%) and completely black (R=G=B=0%) and the luminance is measured one after the other (time sequential).

This way of proceeding is suitable only when the display device does not exhibit ''loading effects'', which means that the luminance of the test pattern is varying with the size of the test pattern. Such loading effects can be found in [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-displays and in [[Plasma display|PDP]]s. A small [[test pattern]] (e.g. 4% window pattern) displayed on these devices can have significantly higher luminance than the corresponding full-screen pattern because the supply current may be limited by special electronic circuits.

==Full-swing contrast==
Any two test patterns that are not completely identical can be used to evaluate a contrast between them. When one test pattern comprises the completely bright state (full-white, R=G=B=100%) and the other one the completely [[dark state]] (full-black, R=G=B=0%) the resulting contrast is called ''full-swing contrast''. This contrast is the highest (maximum) contrast the display can achieve. If no test pattern is specified in a data sheet together with a contrast statement, it will most probably refer to the ''full-swing contrast''.

==Static contrast==

The standard procedure for contrast evaluation is as follows:

1 apply the first test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

2 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the first test pattern and record the result,

3 apply the second test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state,

4 measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the second test pattern and record the result,

5 calculate the resulting ''static contrast'' for the two test patterns using one of the metrics listed above (CR,C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; or K).

When luminance and/or chromaticity are measured before the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, some kind of ''transient contrast'' has been measured instead of the ''static contrast''.

==Transient contrast==

When the image content is changing rapidly, e.g. during the display of video or movie content, the optical state of the display may not reach the intended stable steady state because of slow response and thus the apparent contrast is reduced if compared to the [[#Static_contrast|static contrast]].

|This illustration shows the repetitive impulse response between several states of gray when each state is applied for one frame only. It is obvious that the stationary luminance levels (indicated by dashed horizontal lines) are not reached within a single frame.
|}

==Dynamic contrast==

This is a technique for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens.
 
LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel in front of it which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased.&lt;ref&gt;T. Shiga and S. Mikoshiba: "Reduction of LCTV Backlight Power and Enhancement of Gray Scale Capability by Using an Adaptive Dimming Technique", SID03 Digest, pp. 1364-1367&lt;/ref&gt; Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some [[digital signal processing]] required for implementation of the ''dynamic contrast control technique'' in a way that is pleasing to the human [[visual system]] (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced). 

The contrast within individual frames (''simultaneous contrast'') can be increased when the backlight can be locally dimmed. This can be achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Chen, et al.: "Locally pixel-compensated backlight dimming on LED-backlit LCD TV", JSID 15/12(2007), pp. 981-988&lt;/ref&gt; High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique in order to realize (static) contrast values in the range of CR &gt; 100.000.&lt;ref&gt;H. Seetzen, et al.: "A [[High dynamic range rendering|High Dynamic Range]] Display System Using Low and High Resolution Modulators", SID03 Digest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark-room contrast==

In order to measure the highest contrast possible, the dark state of the display under test must not be corrupted by light from the surroundings, since even small increments ΔL in the denominator of the ratio (L&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) / (L&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔL) effect a considerable reduction of that quotient. This is the reason why most contrast ratios used for advertising purposes are measured under dark-room conditions (illuminance E&lt;sub&gt;DR&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 lx).

All emissive electronic displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit light in the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no [[Low-key lighting|ambient light]] reflected from the display surface into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity.

When these display-screens are used outside a completely dark room, e.g. in the living room (illuminance approx. 100 lx) or in an office situation (illuminance 300 lx minimum), ambient light is reflected from the display surface, adding to the luminance of the dark state and thus reducing the contrast considerably.

A quite novel TV-screen realized with OLED technology is specified with a ''dark-room contrast'' ratio CR = 1.000.000 (one million). In a realistic application situation with 100 lx illuminance the contrast ratio goes down to ~350, with 300 lx it is reduced to ~120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsmanship.com STOP Specsmanship]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|ambient_contrast}}

=="Ambient contrast"==

The contrast that can be experienced or measured in the presence of ambient illumination is shortly called "ambient contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley: "Diffuse Reflectance and Ambient Contrast Measurements Using a Sampling Sphere", SID ADEAC06 Digest, pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of "ambient contrast" is the contrast under outdoor illumination conditions when the illuminance can be very intense (up to 100.000 lx). The contrast apparent under such conditions is called "daylight contrast".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Kelley, et al.: "Display Daylight Ambient Contrast Measurement Methods and Daylight Readability", JSID 14, 11, pp. 1019-1030&lt;/ref&gt;

Since always the dark areas of a display are corrupted by reflected light, reasonable "ambient contrast" values can only be maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or anti-glare coatings.

==Concurrent contrast==

When a test pattern is displayed that contains areas with different luminance and/or chromaticity (e.g. a checkerboard pattern), and an observer sees the different areas simultaneously, the apparent contrast is called ''concurrent contrast'' (the term ''[[simultaneous contrast]]'' is already taken for a different effect). Contrast values obtained from two subsequently displayed full-screen patterns may be different from the values evaluated from a checkerboard pattern with the same optical states. That discrepancy may be due to non-ideal properties of the display-screen (e.g. crosstalk, halation, etc.) and/or due to straylight problems in the light measuring device.

==Successive contrast==

When a contrast is established between two optical states that are perceived or measured one after the other, this contrast is called ''successive contrast''. The contrast between two full-screen patterns (full-screen contrast) always is a ''successive contrast''.

==Methods of measurement==

* contrast of direct-view displays
* contrast of projection displays

Depending on the nature of the display under test (direct-view or projection) the contrast is evaluated as a quotient of luminance values (direct-view) or as a quotient of illuminance values (projection displays) if the properties of the [[projection screen]] is separated from that of the projector. In the latter case, a checkerboard pattern with full-white and full-black rectangles is projected and the illuminance is measured at the center of the rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI IT7.215-1992: Data Projection Equipment and Large Screen Data Displays -- Test Methods and Performance Characteristics&lt;/ref&gt; The standard ANSI IT7.215-1992 defines test-patterns and measurement locations, and a way to obtain the [[luminous flux]] from illuminance measurements, it does not define however a quantity named "ANSI lumen".

If the reflective properties of the projection screen (usually depending on direction) are included in the measurement, the luminance reflected from the centers of the rectangles has to be measured for a (set of) specific [[viewing cone|directions of observation]].

[[Luminance]], contrast and [[chromaticity]] of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD-screens]] is usually varying with the [[viewing cone|direction of observation]] (i.e. [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]). The variation of electro-optical characteristics with [[Viewing cone|viewing direction]] can be measured sequentially by mechanical scanning of the [[viewing cone]] (''gonioscopic'' approach) or by simultaneous measurements based on [[conoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Becker: "Viewing-cone Analysis of LCDs: a Comparison of Measuring Methods", Proc. SID'96, pp. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[jurisprudence]], '''duress''' or '''coercion''' refers to a situation whereby a person performs an act as a result of violence, threat, or other pressure against the person. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (6th ed.) defines duress as "any unlawful [[intimidation|threat]] or [[coercion]] used... to induce another to act [or not act] in a manner [they] otherwise would not [or would]". Duress is pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act they ordinarily would not perform. The notion of duress must be distinguished both from [[undue influence]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]. In [[criminal law]], [[duress and necessity]] are different defenses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[People v. Unger]]'', 362 N.E.2d 319 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on Criminal Law 381 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Duress has two aspects. One is that it negates the person's [[consent]] to an act, such as [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or the entering into a contract; or, secondly, as a possible [[defense (legal)|legal defense]] or justification to an otherwise unlawful act.&lt;ref name=Gaines&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Larry |authorlink= |author2=Miller, LeRoy |title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006 |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location= |isbn=0-495-00305-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A defendant utilizing the duress defense admits to breaking the law, but claims that he/she is not [[Legal liability|liable]] because, even though the act broke the [[law]], it was only performed because of extreme unlawful pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pi1stclass.com/glossary.htm|title=1st Class Investigations Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty, admitting partial [[culpability]], so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted.

Duress or [[coercion]] can also be raised in an allegation of [[rape]] or other [[sexual assault]] to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation.

==Discussion==
A defendant who raises a defense of duress has actually done everything to constitute the ''[[actus reus]]'' of the crime, and has the ''[[mens rea]]'' because they intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of [[culpability]] already attaches to the defendant for what was done. 

In criminal law, the defendant's motive for breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an [[affirmative defense]] allowed for by law. (Duress may or may not be allowed as an affirmative defence for some particular charge -- in particular, it is generally forbidden for [[murder]], and many jurisdictions also forbid it for [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Malum in se]]'' offences, generally, are less likely to recognise duress as a defence than ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' offences.)

A successful affirmative defence means not that a criminal act was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no affirmative defence of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter [[sentence (law)|sentence]], typically in proportion to the degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.

In some rare cases, a successful argument of duress -- even when not an affirmative defence -- might result in the jury [[Jury nullification|nullifying]] the charge by refusing to convict.

The basis of the defense is that the duress actually overwhelmed the defendant's will and would also have overwhelmed the will of a person of ordinary courage (a hybrid test requiring both subjective evidence of the accused's state of mind, and an objective confirmation that the failure to resist the threats was reasonable), thus rendering the entire behavior involuntary. Thus, the liability should be reduced or discharged, making the defense one of [[exculpation]].

The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a matter of [[public policy]]. A state may say that no threat should force a person to deliberately break the law, particularly if this breach will cause significant loss or damage to a third person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law.

A mutant of duress involves [[hostage]] taking, where a person is forced to commit a criminal act under the threat, say, that their family member or close associate will be immediately killed should they refuse (commonly known as a [[Tiger kidnapping]]).  This has been raised in some cases of [[ransom]], where a person commits theft or embezzlement under orders from a kidnapper in order to secure a family member's life and freedom.  However, duress is not a complete defense to all crimes.  For example, the general rule, both at common law and today, is that duress is never a defense to murder; that is, one is never justified in killing another innocent person even if one's own life has been threatened, although this part may be questioned when multiple people are threatened with death if the defendant does not kill a single or fewer people than threatened (such a situation is similar to the [[trolley problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Anderson'', 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
For duress to qualify as a defense, four requirements must be met:&lt;ref name=Gaines /&gt;
# The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
# The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
# The threat must be immediate and inescapable
# The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

A person may also raise a duress defense when force or violence is used to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge.

== In contract law ==
{{Contract law}}
''Duress'' in the context of contract law is a [[common law]] defence brought about when one of the parties to the contract enjoyed an ascendant position in relation to the other party and abused that position by subjecting the other to ''threats.'' A party who has entered into a contract under duress is entitled to rescind or set aside the contract, rendering it voidable (in equity).

Duress is a threat of harm made to compel someone to do something against their will or judgment; especially a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition. - Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4lawnotes.com/outlines/duress.htm|title=Duress : Introduction to Contracts Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical duress
* Economic duress&lt;ref&gt; See ''Pao On v Lau Yiu Long'' [1979] 3 All ER 65; [[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]; Applied in ''Con Ange v Calogo Bloodstock AG t/as Coolmore Australia'' [2012] NSWSC 666. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical duress===
====Duress to the person====
Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts physical duress simply:  "Your money or your life."  
In ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] AC 104 [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1973/2.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a decision of the [[Privy Council]], Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff's decision to enter the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crescendo Management Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp'' (1988) 19 NSWLR 40, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law took a narrow view of the concept of duress in that it was concerned with actual or threatened violence to the person or unlawful imprisonment. Equity, however, adopted a broader "fusion" view of what sort of pressure could constitute coercion for purposes of relief and has since prevailed. &lt;ref&gt;See J Paterson, A Robertson and A Duke, ''Principles of Contract Law'', (4th edn Thomson Reuters 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Duress to goods====
In such cases, one party refuses to release the goods belonging to the other party until the other party enters into a contract with them. For example, in ''Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd v Helicopter Charter Pty Ltd'' (1991) 22 NSWLR 298, the contract was set aside after Hawker Pacific's threats to withhold the helicopter from the plaintiff unless further payments were made for repairing a botched paint job.

===The elements of economic duress===

Economic duress is the use of unlawful economic pressure to compel a party to a contract to agree to demands which they would not have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Wrongful or improper threat''': No precise definition of what is wrongful or improper.  Examples include: morally wrong, criminal, or tortious conduct; one that is a threat to breach a contract "in bad faith" or threaten to withhold an admitted debt "in bad faith".
#'''No reasonable alternative (but to accept the other party's terms)'''. If there is an available legal remedy, an available market substitute (in the form of funds, goods, or services), or any other sources of funds this element is not met.
#'''The threat actually induces the making of the contract'''. This is a subjective standard, and takes into account the victim's age, their background (especially their education), relationship of the parties, and the ability to receive advice.
#'''The other party caused the financial distress'''. The majority opinion is that the other party must have caused the distress, while the minority opinion allows them to merely take advantage of the distress.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} See ''Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel)'' [1981] UKHL 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insane duress==
In criminal law, when a person is found legally insane because they believed God ordered them to do the crime ("[[deific-decree]]"), one interpretation of the insanity is that they acted under a delusion of duress by God.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|615-625}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15023">[[Animal echolocation|Echolocation]] (or sonar) systems of animals, like human [[Radar jamming and deception|radar systems]], are susceptible to interference known as '''echolocation jamming''' or sonar jamming. Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes. Jamming can be purposeful or inadvertent, and can be caused by the echolocation system itself, other echolocating animals, prey, or humans. Echolocating animals have evolved to minimize jamming, however, echolocation avoidance behaviors are not always successful.

== Self jamming ==

Echolocating animals can jam themselves in a number of ways. Bats, for example, produce some of the loudest sounds in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surlykke|first=A|author2=Kalko, EK|title=Echolocating bats cry out loud to detect their prey.|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2008|volume=3|issue=4|pages=e2036|pmid=18446226|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002036|pmc=2323577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then they immediately listen for echoes that are hundreds of times fainter than the sounds they emit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kick|first=S. A.|author2=J. A. Simmons|title=Automatic gain control in the bat's sonar receiver and the neuroethology of echolocation|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=1984|volume=4|pages=2725–37|pmid=6502201|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid deafening themselves, whenever a bat makes an echolocation emission, a small muscle in the bat's middle ear (the [[stapedius]] muscle) clamps down on small bones called [[ossicles]], which normally amplify sounds between the [[ear drum]] and the [[cochlea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henson OW|first=Jr|title=The activity and function of the middle-ear muscles in echo-locating bats.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1965|volume=180|issue=4|pages=871–887|pmid=5880367|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007737|pmc=1357428}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dampens the intensity of the sounds that the bat hears during this time, preserving hearing sensitivity to target echoes.

Jamming can occur if an animal is still producing a sound when an echo returns, for example, from a nearby object. Bats avoid this type of jamming by producing short sounds of 3-50 ms when searching for prey or navigating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Donald R.|author2=Webster, Frederic A. |author3=Michael, Charles R. |title=The echolocation of flying insects by bats|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1960|volume=8|issue=3–4|pages=141–154|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(60)90022-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bats produce progressively shorter sounds, down to 0.5 ms, to avoid self-jamming when echolocating targets that they are approaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Thomas|editor-first1=Jeanette A.|editor-last2=Moss|editor-first2=Cynthia F.|editor-last3=Vater|editor-first3=Marianne|title=Echolocation in bats and dolphins|year=2004|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226795985|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because echoes from nearby targets will return to the bat sooner than sounds from distant targets.

Another form of jamming occurs when an echolocating animal produces many sounds in succession and assigns an echo to the wrong emission. To avoid this type of jamming, bats typically wait enough time for echoes to return from all possible targets before making the next sound. This can be seen clearly when a bat attacks an insect. The bat produces sounds with progressively shorter time intervals, but always allowing enough time for sounds to travel to the target and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elemens|first=Coen P. H.|author2=A. F. Mead |author3=L. Jakobsen |author4=J. M. Ratcliffe |title=Superfast Muscles Set Maximum Call Rate in Echolocating Bats|journal=Science|year=2011|volume=333|pages=1885–1888|pmid=21960635|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1885.short|doi=10.1126/science.1207309|issue=6051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way bats overcome this problem is by producing successive sounds with unique time-frequency structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiryu|first=S.|author2=Bates, M. E. |author3=Simmons, J. A. |author4= Riquimaroux, H. |title=FM echolocating bats shift frequencies to avoid broadcast-echo ambiguity in clutter|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2010|volume=107|issue=15|pages=7048–7053|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000429107 |pmid=20351291 |pmc=2872447}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows bats to process echoes from multiple emissions at the same time, and to correctly assign an echo to its emission using its time-frequency signature.

== Jamming by other echolocation systems ==

Like [[electric fish]], echolocating animals are susceptible to jamming from other animals of the same species emitting signals in the nearby environment.&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulanovsky|first=N.|author2=Fenton, M. B. |author3=Tsoar, A. |author4= Korine, C. |title=Dynamics of jamming avoidance in echolocating bats|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2004|volume=271|issue=1547|pages=1467–1475|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2750 |pmid=15306318 |pmc=1691745}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such jamming, bats use a strategy also employed by electric fish to avoid this jamming: a behavior known as [[jamming avoidance response]] (JAR).&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky"/&gt; In a JAR, one or both animals change the frequency of their sounds away from that used by the other animal.&lt;ref name = "Ulanovsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillam|first=E. H|author2=Ulanovsky, N. |author3=McCracken, G. F |title=Rapid jamming avoidance in biosonar|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2007|volume=274|issue=1610|pages=651–660|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0047|pmid=17254989|pmc=2197216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect of allowing each animal a unique frequency bandwidth where jamming will not occur. Bats can make this adjustment very rapidly, often in less than 0.2 seconds.&lt;ref name="Gillam" /&gt;

[[Big brown bat]]s can avoid jamming by going silent for periods of time when following another echolocating big brown bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiu|first=C.|author2=Xian, W. |author3=Moss, C. F. |title=Flying in silence: Echolocating bats cease vocalizing to avoid sonar jamming|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2008|volume=105|issue=35|pages=13116–13121|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804408105|pmid=18725624|pmc=2529029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes allows the silent bat to capture a prey in competitive foraging situations.

== Jamming by prey ==

[[File:Bertholdiatrigona.jpg|thumbnail|right|The moth ''Bertholdia trigona'' is the only animal in nature known to jam the echolocation of its predator]]
Many [[Arctiidae|tiger moths]] produce ultrasonic clicks in response to the echolocation calls bats use while attacking prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=J. R.|title=Tiger moth responses to a simulated bat attack: timing and duty cycle|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=2006|volume=209|issue=14|pages=2637–2650|doi=10.1242/jeb.02295|pmid=16809455}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most species of tiger moth these clicks warn bats that the moths have toxic compounds that make them distasteful.&lt;ref name = "Hristov"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hristov|first=N.

=== History ===

The possibility that moths jam bat echolocation arose with an experiment report published in 1965 by Dorothy Dunning and Kenneth Roeder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=D. C.|author2=Roeder, K. D.|title=Moth Sounds and the Insect-Catching Behavior of Bats|journal=Science|year=1965|volume=147|issue=3654|pages=173–174|doi=10.1126/science.147.3654.173|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/147/3654/173.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moth clicks were played through a loudspeaker as bats tried to capture mealworms catapulted through the air. Moth clicks caused bats to veer away from the mealworms, but echolocation calls played through the speaker did not, causing the authors to conclude that the moth clicks themselves dissuaded the bats. However, it was later determined that the moth clicks were played at an unnaturally loud level, invalidating this conclusion.&lt;ref name = "Dunning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunning|first=Dorothy C.|title=Warning Sounds of moths|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|year=1968|volume=25|pages=125–138|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1968.tb00008|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1968.tb00008.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years Dunning conducted further experiments to show that moth clicks serve a warning function.&lt;ref name = "Dunning" /&gt; That is, they communicate to bats that the moths are toxic, as many moths accumulate toxic chemicals from their host plants as caterpillars and keep them in their tissues through adulthood. Roeder agreed with Dunning’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roeder|first=Kenneth D.|title=Nerve cells and insect behavior|year=1967|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=0674608011|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nerve-Cells-Insect-Behavior-Revised/dp/0674608011|edition=Rev. ed., 1. Harvard Univ. Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Fullard and colleagues published findings in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fullard|first=James H.|author2=Fenton, M. Brock |author3=Simmons, James A. |title=Jamming bat echolocation: the clicks of arctiid moths|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1979|volume=57|issue=3|pages=647–649|doi=10.1139/z79-076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fullard|first=JH|author2=Simmons, JA |author3=Saillant, PA |title=Jamming bat echolocation: the dogbane tiger moth Cycnia tenera times its clicks to the terminal attack calls of the big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1994|volume=194|pages=285–98|pmid=7964403|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/194/1/285.short|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing in favor of the jamming hypothesis based on the acoustic characteristics of moth clicks, however this hypothesis was still widely debated in the literature during that time.&lt;ref name = "Hristov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surlykke|first=Annemarie|author2=Miller, Lee A.|title=The influence of arctiid moth clicks on bat echolocation; jamming or warning?|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|year=1985|volume=156|issue=6|pages=831–843|doi=10.1007/BF00610835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratcliffe|first=J.

In the 1990s experiments were conducted broadcasting clicks to bats performing echolocation tasks on a platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Lee A.|title=Arctiid moth clicks can degrade the accuracy of range difference discrimination in echolocating big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|year=1991|volume=168|issue=5|pages=571–579|doi=10.1007/BF00215079|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00215079}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and with neurophysiological methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tougaard|first=J.|author2=Casseday, J.

The researchers concluded that most tiger moths do not produce enough sound to jam bat sonar.

The first study to conclusively demonstrate that moths jam bats was published in 2009 by researchers at Wake Forest University.&lt;ref name = "Corcoran" /&gt; In this study big brown bats were raised in captivity to ensure they had no prior experience with clicking prey and trained to attack moths tethered to a thin line attached to the ceiling in an indoor flight room. Over a nine-night experiment the bats attacked non-clicking control moths and clicking ''Bertholdia trigona'' – moths that were selected for their extraordinary clicking abilities. Bats had substantial difficulty catching the clicking moths compared to silent controls, and ate the ''B. trigona'' moths when they had the opportunity, thus refuting the hypothesis that the clicks were warning the bats of moths’ toxicity. Moth clicks also disrupted the stereotypical pattern of the bats echolocation, confirming the clicks’ jamming function.

== Humans jamming animals ==

Humans may jam echolocating animals deliberately or accidentally. Recent efforts have been made to develop acoustic jamming deterrents to exclude bats from buildings or bridges, or to keep bats away from wind turbines where large numbers of mortalities occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szewczak|first=J. M.|author2=E. Arnett|title=Field Test Results of a Potential Acoustic Deterrent to Reduce Bat Mortality from Wind Turbines|journal=Unpublished Report|year=2007|url=http://batsandwind.org/pdf/2007DeterrentPondStudyFinal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterrents have been shown to reduce bat activity over a small area. However, scaling up acoustic deterrents to large volumes for applications such as keeping bats away from wind turbines is difficult because of the high atmospheric attenuation of [[ultrasound]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32038">'''Escalation of commitment''' is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some [[Decision-making|decision]], action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=C7KbGmTg3qUC|page=191}} |chapter=The escalation of commitment: An update and appraisal|editor1-last=Shapira|editor1-first=Zur|title=Organizational Decision Making|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=191–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and [[behavioral scientists]] use a related term, ''sunk-cost fallacy'', to describe the justification of increased [[investment]] of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("[[sunk cost]]") despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

In [[sociology]], ''irrational escalation of commitment'' or ''commitment bias'' describe similar behaviours. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying it are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", "in for a penny, in for a pound", and "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

== Early use ==
Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his 1976 paper, "Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action".&lt;ref name=Staw1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|title=Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1976|volume=16|issue=1|pages=27–44|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90005-2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Researchers define escalation of commitment ===

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project altogether.&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Henry|title=The two faces of conscientiousness: Duty and achievement striving in escalation of commitment dilemmas|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=533–540|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how  escalation of commitment is observed in two different categories.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockner|first1=Joel|title=The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical progress|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.5465/AMR.1992.4279568|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233821/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [[expectancy theory]]. "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The next phase of the escalation process is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed  and tested through situational development and resource allocation.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of budgeting and mental accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of commitment was described by [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], who wrote to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to explain to him the predictions of the war outcome:&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

{{quote|The decision you face now is crucial. Once large numbers of U.S. troops are committed to direct combat, they will begin to take heavy casualties in a war they are ill equipped to fight in a noncooperative if not downright hostile countryside. Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation would be more likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we have paid terrible costs.&lt;ref name="Gettleman1995"&gt;Ball, George (July 1, 1965). "Memo from George Ball to President Johnson. A Compromise Solution in South Vietnam". In {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVtNalqmYgAC&amp;pg=PA283|last=Gettleman|first=Marvin E.|title=Vietnam and America: A Documented History|year=1995|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3362-5|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Theories ==
=== Self-justification theory ===

[[Self-justification theory|Self-justification]] thought process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels.&lt;ref name="Huning2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Performance Attributions on Escalation of Commitment|last = Huning|first = Tobias M|date = 2014|volume = 18|issue = 1|journal = Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Thomson|first2 = Neal F|url = http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623232138/http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf#page=157|archivedate = 2016-06-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude provides "one explanation for why people escalate commitment to their past investments."&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Escalation of Commitment|last = Kelly|first = Theresa F|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages =256–259 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Management Theory|last2 = Milkman|first2 = Katherine L|editor1-last=Kessler|editor1-first= Eric H|doi=10.4135/9781452276090.n78|ISBN= 9781412997829|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4wtzAwAAQBAJ|page=256}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers make decisions that reflect previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what factors realistically matter when making decisions.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===

[[Prospect theory]] helps to describe the natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a situation based on costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The framing to how the problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you and how to prepare for those changes. "Whyte (1986) argued that prospect theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988: 99)"&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this theory seems realistic, researchers "Davis and Bobko (1986) found no effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the previous course of action in the positive frame condition."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Which means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher responsibility situation.

=== Attribution theory ===

The [[attribution theory]], originating from [[Fritz Heider]], "attempts to find causal explanations for events and human behaviors." This theory approaches two methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task difficulty.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship between internal and external factors to describe why they made a decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event, or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by anyone else. Research suggests that "the type of attribution made by an employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as escalation of commitment."&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Social identity theory ===

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [[social identity theory]]. People make connections between their use of groups and their own view of themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment in political decision-making groups: a social identity approach|last = Dietz-Uhler|first = Beth|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=611–629|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;611::AID-EJSP781&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models ===

==== Temporal model of escalation ====
Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare actions and behaviors at "different points in time."&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt; This is a form of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any threat to the group.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt;

==== Aggregate model ====
"The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of forces rather than the ordering of effects over time."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; The model is general and can provide an ideal view as to how. The effects whether positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm. There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well as see the bigger picture of the situation.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Determinants ==
The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleesman|first1=Dustin J.|last2=Conlon|first2=Donald E.|last3=McNamara|first3=Gerry|last4=Miles|first4=Jonathan E.|title=Cleaning Up the Big Muddy: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Determinants of Escalation of Commitment|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=541–562|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.0696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project ===

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general project characteristics and initial financial costs.&lt;ref name="Liang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Beichen|last2=Kale|first2=Sudhir H.|last3=Cherian|first3=Joseph|title=Is the future static or dynamic? The role of culture on escalation of commitment in new product development|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been found to have positive relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior. In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being trapped in their current, costly behaviors.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt;

=== Psychological ===

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the actions and information involved in a project. This can include cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project elements.&lt;ref name="Liang2014" /&gt; Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to project completion have been found to have positive relationships with escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive information framing have been found to have negative relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt; In these instances, people take further risk in an attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit mistakes.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn around. [[Confirmation bias]] can also lead to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to recognize the negative results of their decisions.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; On the other hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression management prompts continued investment over pulling out.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity of completion goals at those points.&lt;ref name=Horn2012&gt;{{cite thesis|first1=Marianna|last1=Horn|title=The downside of persistence: The effects of mood on an escalation of commitment paradigm|date=2012|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/3290?show=full|HDL=10415/3290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's more likely that risks will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible midpoint.

=== Social ===

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance in relation.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

==== External justification and binding ====
Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox &amp; Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &amp; Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like "that project is Bob's baby," or "oh, we had the same idea." Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

==== Leadership norms ====
Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of commitments can discussed in more detail and importance, there are many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce responsibly.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Structural ===

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and environmental features and resources of the project's overall organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure of a team and how the make decisions. Decisions are made based on individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also unpredictable and controllable. "Organizations have very imperfect sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their environments."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions, and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy change, rulings and procedures.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not free to change. "On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; One primary example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [[Pan American World Airways]] company, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their image of being an airline was more important than being a successful company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought they needed to remain to be Pan Am.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Groups vs individuals ==
In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized, communication speed, policies, and business politics can be hindrances.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; A larger organization, especially one with a spread of subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel that they too are being replaced or terminated.&lt;ref name="Stray2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stray|first1=Viktoria Gulliksen|last2=Moe|first2=Nils Brede|last3=Dybå|first3=Tore|chapter=Escalation of Commitment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings|date=2012|volume=111|pages=153–167|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11|title=Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming|ISBN=978-3-642-30349-4|series= Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalation of commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to directly lead and influence.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max H.|last2=Giuliano|first2=Toni|last3=Appelman|first3=Alan|title=Escalation of commitment in individual and group decision making|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1984|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(84)90017-5|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318080454/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of support for their initial actions to the point where escalation potential is increased. In this case, [[groupthink]] assists in keeping with the original decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels of inclusion in the process.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984" /&gt;

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for further conflicts between the two.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Thomas|last3=Barton|first3=Sidney L.|title=Escalation of commitment in private family businesses: The influence of outside board members|journal=Journal of Family Business Strategy|date=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1016/j.jfbs.2012.01.002|url=http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504212721/http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business reputation, customer and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

{{short description|Termination of a taxon by the death of the last member}}
{{Conservation status}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''extinction''' is the termination of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

Through [[evolution]], species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann {{ISBN|0-434-22610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|The [[dodo]] of [[Mauritius]], shown here in a 1626 illustration by [[Roelant Savery]], is an often-cited example of [[Holocene extinction|modern extinction]]&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] | publisher = [[W.

Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

A new study suggests that it could take up to 5 to 7 million years for mammal diversity to be restored to its state prior to the arrival of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mammal-diversity-extinction-study_us_5bc59f68e4b055bc94796ecf|title=Mammals Will Still Be Recovering From Human Destruction Long After We're Gone|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2018-10-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed ([[anagenesis]]) into a successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Michael |last2=Mulligan |first2=Pamela |last3=Stansfield |first3=William |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or split into more than one ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leighton |first=Lindsey R. |title=Taxon Characteristics That Promote Survivorship Through the Permian-Triassic Interval: Transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic Brachiopod Fauna  |journal=Paleobiology |date=2009 |volume=34 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1666/06082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===

The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.&lt;ref name="dinofish"&gt;[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt; A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt;

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover – John R.

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVLEV64qYfcC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-03-12|isbn = 9781444308938|language = en|first = L. Scott|last = Mills|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&amp;nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref name="Raup"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J.

When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences.

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===
{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion|Mutational meltdown}}
If [[adaptation]] increasing population [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious [[mutation]]s, then a population will go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=J|last2=Gomez|first2=K|last3=Masel|first3=J|title=Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with population genetics|journal=Evolution|date=February 2017|volume=71|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1111/evo.13116|arxiv=1605.08717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to [[fixation (population genetics)|fix]] in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause [[mutational meltdown]].

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, J.L.  |author2=S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects [[evolvability]], including [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]]. A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent.

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|The [[golden toad]] was last seen on May 15, 1989. [[Decline in amphibian populations]] is ongoing worldwide]]

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating. Survey is now 20+ years old.  --&gt; of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;[[American Museum of Natural History]].

For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a [[species]] was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|date=2009|title=Thomas Jefferson, extinction, and the evolving view of Earth history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries|url=http://memoirs.gsapubs.org/content/203/225.abstract|journal=GSA Memoirs|volume=203|pages=225–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the [[Great chain of being|Great Chain of Being]], in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33224/33224-h/33224-h.htm|title=The Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology|last=Lyells|first=Charles|publisher=Appleton Co|year=1854|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a firm supporter of the [[Great Chain of Being]] and an opponent of extinction,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/on-the-extinction-of-species/|title=On the Extinction of Species|last=Bressan|first=David|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqHwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;lpg=PT88&amp;dq=%22Extinction,+diversity,+and+endangerment%22+david+sepkoski&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tpA16i2uMn&amp;sig=oH9FP_N1r2swggDmOvzLzg8LH10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpMKv9NTTAhUh7oMKHUOaA2wQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Extinction,%20diversity,%20and%20endangerment%22%20david%20sepkoski&amp;f=false|title=Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture|last=Vidal|first=Fernando|last2=Dias|first2=Nélia|date=2015-06-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317538073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7LriV7aZpkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=hooke+nautilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWXg0qsaJ8&amp;sig=vUkaTNuCy8Ud9RjliZubXBdD4bM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6rGQptXTAhUF2IMKHfamAc8Q6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=hooke%20nautilus&amp;f=false|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005-05-03|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=9781596921153|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; While he contended that  it was possible a species could be "lost", he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912273245|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521819288|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart|Alexandre Bronigniart]] &amp; [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45730036|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M. J.|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226731063|oclc=45730036}}&lt;/ref&gt; His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptist Lamarck]], a [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898833548|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520058309|oclc=898833548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He similarly argued against [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]], could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name="Kotzman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name="INCHEM"&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that "we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal." He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benatar|first=David|date=2008 |title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197 |isbn=978-0199549269|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans –- that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".&lt;ref name="Judson"/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M.

Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

"This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica'').

The '''Five Wisdoms'''{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit: ''pañca-jñāna''; {{bo|t=ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ|w=ye shes lnga}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/ye_shes_lnga Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese: ''go-chi''}} are five kinds of wisdoms which appear when the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mind]] is purified of the five disturbing emotions and the natural mind appears.&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen"&gt;[http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms Lone Hansen (Shenphen Chödron), ''The Five Wisdoms''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194208/http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Anger, jealousy, pride, attachment and ignorance&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;}} All of those five wisdoms are represented by one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|five buddha-families]].&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
''Pañca-jñāna'' is orthographically rendered into English as:  Five Wisdoms, Five Awarenesses, Five Pristine Cognitions.

==Five Wisdoms==
The Five Wisdoms are:
# ''Tathatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of [[Suchness]] or ''[[Dharmadhatu]]'', "the bare non-conceptualizing awareness" of ''[[Śūnyatā]]'', the [[monism|universal substrate]] of the other four ''jñāna'';{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''Ādarśa-jñāna'', the wisdom of "Mirror-like Awareness", "devoid of all dualistic thought and ever united with its 'content' as a mirror is with its reflections";{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}{{refn|group=note|''Ādarśa'' is Sanskrit for "mirror", the term may be parsed into the [[etymon]] of ''[[darśana]]'' with a grammatical [[adposition]]}}
# ''Samatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of the "Awareness of Sameness", which perceives the sameness, the commonality of  ''[[dharmas]]'' or [[phenomena]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Investigative Awareness", that perceives the [[:wikt:specificity|specificity]], the uniqueness of ''dharmas''.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Accomplishing Activities", the awareness that "spontaneously carries out all that has to be done for the welfare of beings, manifesting itself in all directions".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

The Five Wisdoms "emerge through a transformation (parāvṛtti) of the eight consciousnesses at the moment of enlightenment".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

==Five Dhyani Buddhas==
[[Image:BuddhaLoutsSm.jpg|thumb|Cloth with painting of the Buddha]]

The idea of the Five Wisdoms "underwent a considerable development" within [[Tibetan Buddhism]] where they are "symbolized or embodied" in the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

According to [[Tenzin Wangyal]], the [[Five Pure Lights]] become the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Five Poisons]] if we remain deluded, or the Five Wisdoms and the [[Five Buddha Families]] if we recognize their purity.&lt;ref&gt;Wangyal, Tenzin (author) &amp; Dahlby, Mark (editor). ''Healing with Form, Energy and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen''.  Ithaca, NY, USA: Snow Lion Publications.  {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Wisdoms, and the accompanying Five Buddhas, are represented in Tibetan Buddhism by the "symbolic bone ornaments".{{refn|group=note|Skt: aṣṭhiamudrā; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya}}&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"&gt;[[Jamgon Kongtrul|Kongtrul, Jamgön]] (author); (English translators: Guarisco, Elio; McLeod, Ingrid) (2005).

Bolder, Colorado, USA: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-210-X}} (alk.paper) p.493&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' associates the Symbolic Bone Ornaments directly with the Five Wisdoms:{{refn|group=note|These are elucidated by a commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' by [[Jamgön Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;refer CH, f. 66a6-b1; where CH = Kongtrul Lodrö Taé, ''Disclosing the Secret of the Invincible Vajra: Phrase by Phrase Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra Two Examinations'' (dPal kye'i rdo rje'i rgyud kyi rgyal po brtag pa gnyis pa'i tshig don rnam par 'grol ba bzhom med rdo rje'i gsang ba 'byed pa).

# the 'wheel-like' (Tib.: 'khor lo) 'crown ornament' (sometimes called 'crown jewel') (Tib.: gtsug gi nor bu), symbolic of [[Akshobhya]] and 'mirror-like pristine awareness' (Ādarśa-jñāna);
# 'earrings' (Tib.: rna cha) represent of [[Amitabha]] and pristine awareness of discernment (Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna);
# 'necklace' (Tib.: mgul rgyan) symbolizing [[Ratnasambhava]] and pristine awareness of total sameness (Samatā-jñāna);

# 'girdle' (Tib.: ske rags) symbolizing [[Amoghasiddhi]] and the accomplishing pristine awareness (Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna);
The additional ornament spoken of in various texts related to Hevajra is ash from a cremation ground smeared on the body (Tib.: thal chen).&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6484">The terms '''food critic''', '''food writer''', and '''restaurant critic''' can all be used to describe a [[writer]] who analyzes food or [[restaurant]]s and then publishes the results of their findings.  While these terms are not strictly synonymous they are often used interchangeably, at least in some circumstances.  Those who share their opinions via [[food column]]s in newspapers and magazines are known as '''food columnists'''. They are often experts in the field.

==Terminology==
"Food writer" is often used as a broad term that encompasses someone who writes about food and about restaurants. For example, [[Ruth Reichl]] is often described as a food writer/editor, who in the course of her career served as the "restaurant critic" for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/authordetail.cfm?authorID=9376 Ruth Reichl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[R. W. Apple, Jr.|R.W. "Johnny" Apple]] was also described as a food writer, but never served as a designated restaurant critic. Nonetheless, he wrote frequently about restaurants as he traveled in search of good eats. [[Calvin Trillin]] writes a great deal about food (among other things) and has been known to write occasionally about specific restaurants, e.g., [[Arthur Bryant's]] and Diedee's. But restaurants figure less prominently in his writing than in Apple's. Finally, [[Richard Olney (food writer)|Richard Olney]] was also a noted food writer, but rarely if ever wrote about restaurants.

Food critics and "restaurant critic" are synonyms, in practice, although there is still a distinction to be made. Both suggest a critical, evaluative stance that often involves some kind of rating system. The distinction, if any involves the range of possible investigation. "Food critic" has a more contemporary vibe, suggesting that restaurants, bakeries, food festivals, street vendors, and taco trucks are all fair game. [[Jonathan Gold]] of ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who holds the distinction of being the first food critic to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]], exemplifies this trend. "Restaurant critic" is the more traditional title and can connote a more restricted sphere of operations — traditional restaurants, with perhaps those serving [[French cuisine]] being the examples. The change in practice, if not in terminology, is often attributed to Reichl's arrival at the ''New York Times'', replacing Bryan Miller. In a series of well-documented incidents, Miller complained that Reichl was "giving SoHo noodle shops 2 and 3 stars" and destroying the rating system that had been built up by [[Craig Claiborne]], [[Mimi Sheraton]], and Miller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/nov96/interview961118.html The Salon Interview | Ruth Reichl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable food critics==
For most of the past century, the most highly visible food critics have been those who have written for daily newspapers throughout the world and a few who have been restaurant reviewers for influential magazines, such as [[Gourmet (magazine)|''Gourmet'']] in the United States. The ephemeral nature of radio and television has meant that very few food critics have used this medium effectively (as opposed to chefs who have used all media to great effect). An example is the BBC's ''The Food Programme''. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has also used both broadcast media and print to concentrate on food production rather than presentation, starting a new column in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in September 2006.

Restaurant critics range in their approach to writing from the acerbic (such as [[A. A. Gill]] from London), to the witty/humorous (such as [[Morgan Murphy (food critic)|Morgan Murphy]], "America's Funniest Food Critic," or Terry Durack from "[[The Independent on Sunday]]") to the "been there done that" approach of Ruth Reichl of ''Gourmet'' and formerly of ''The New York Times''. Other notable critics include Patricia Wells of the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', who writes knowledgeable and perceptive articles about food and restaurants and who occasionally uses the sword rather than her usual suave style. Another was R. W. Apple, Jr., from ''The New York Times'', who wrote long, thoughtful articles about his travels throughout the world in search of great food. Brad A. Johnson in Los Angeles is the only American restaurant critic to win both the coveted [[James Beard Award]] and the [[Le Cordon Bleu]] World Food Media Award for restaurant criticism.

Then there are myriad regional food critics, ranging from Nancy Leson in Seattle, to [[Pat Nourse]] in Sydney, Cooper Adams in Albany, and Stephen Downes and John Lethlean in Melbourne, who pen weekly and monthly reviews of the best of their respective cities.

[[Giles Coren]] was very known to his show, "Million Dollar Critic" who assesses the restaurants in [[Canada]] &amp; [[United States]] where he focuses on quality of services, food taste &amp; the ambiance of each and every restaurant that he visited. Aside from his hosting project, he is also a food columnist for [[The Times|The London Times]], [[GQ]], [[Tatler]] &amp; [[The Independent|The Independent UK]] to tell about his reviews of restaurants around the world, especially in [[United Kingdom]].

==Food criticism on the internet==
The internet has slowly become more important in forming opinions about restaurants. Food criticism on the Internet has allowed creation of shows with specific audiences.&lt;ref name="newsobserver"&gt;{{cite news|title=Web viewers warm up to frozen food show|first=Sue|last=Stock|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/18/440825/web-viewers-warm-up-to-frozen.html?storylink=misearch|newspaper=[[News &amp; Observer]]|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=10 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822204614/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/18/440825/web-viewers-warm-up-to-frozen.html?storylink=misearch|archivedate=22 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7932">'''Functional analysis''' in [[behavioral psychology]] is the application of the laws of [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]] to establish the relationships between [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli and responses]]. To establish the function of operant behavior, one typically examines the "four-term contingency": first by identifying the [[motivating operation]]s (EO or AO), then identifying the antecedent or trigger of the behavior, identifying the behavior itself as it has been [[operationalize]]d, and identifying the consequence of the behavior which continues to maintain it.

Functional assessment in [[behavior analysis]] employs principles derived from the natural science of behavior analysis to determine the "reason", purpose, or motivation for a behavior.  The most robust form of functional assessment is functional analysis, which involves the direct manipulation, using some experimental design (e.g., a multielement design or a reversal design) of various antecedent and consequent events and measurement of their effects on the behavior of interest; this is the only method of functional assessment that allows for demonstration of clear cause of behavior. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Applications in clinical psychology==
Functional analysis and consequence analysis are commonly used in certain types of psychotherapy to better understand, and in some cases change, behavior. It is particularly common in [[behavioral therapy|behavioral therapies]] such as [[behavioral activation]],&lt;ref&gt;Kanter, J.W.; Cautilli, J.D.; Busch, A.M. &amp; Baruch, D.E. (2005). Toward a Comprehensive Functional Analysis of Depressive Behavior: Five Environmental Factors and a Possible Sixth and Seventh. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6(1), 65–81.[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also part of Aaron Beck's [[cognitive therapy]]. In addition, functional analysis modified into a behavior chain analysis is often used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampl, S.; Wakai, S.; Trestman, R. &amp; Keeney, E.M. (2008). Functional Analysis of Behavior in Corrections: Empowering Inmates in Skills Training Groups. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(4), 42–51 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages to using functional analysis over traditional assessment methods. Firstly, behavioral observation is more reliable than traditional self-report methods. This is because observing the individual from an objective stand point in their regular environment allows the observer to observe both the antecedent and the consequence of the problem behavior. Secondly, functional analysis is advantageous as it allows for the development of behavioral interventions, either antecedent control or consequence control, specifically designed to reduce a problem behavior. Thirdly, functional analysis is advantageous for interventions for young children or developmentally delayed children with problem behaviors, who may not be able to answer self-report questions about the reasons for their actions.

Despite these benefits, functional analysis also has some disadvantages. The first that no standard methods for determining function have been determined&lt;ref&gt;Angela Waguespack, Terrence Vaccaro &amp; Lauren Continere (2006). Functional Behavioral Assessment and Intervention with Emotional/Behaviorally Disordered Students: In Pursuit of State of the Art. ''IJBCT'', 4(2), 463–74 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt; and meta-analysis shows that different methodologies appear to bias results toward particular functions as well as not effective in improving outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Delfs, C.H. &amp; Campbell, J.M. (2010). A quantitative synthesis of developmental disability research: The impact of functional assessment methodology on treatment effectiveness. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 11(1), 4–19 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Gresham and colleagues (2004) in a meta-analytic review of JABA articles found that functional assessment did not produce greater effect sizes compared to simple [[contingency management]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gresham, F.; McIntyre, L.L.; Olson-Tinker, H.; Dolstra, L.; McLaughlin, V. &amp; Van, M. (2004). Relevance of functional behavioral assessment research for school based behavioral intervention and positive behavioral support. ''Research in Developmental Disabilities'', 25, 19–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Gresham et al. combined the three types of functional assessment, of which descriptive assessment and indirect assessment have been reliably found to produce results with limited validity&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, R. H., &amp; Iwata, B. A.  (2001). A comparison of outcomes from descriptive and functional analyses of problem behavior.  "Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis", 40, 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. A., Smith, R. G., Dracobly, J. D., &amp; Pace, A. P.  (2012).  Multiple-respondent anecdotal assessments: An analysis of interrupter agreement and correspondence with analogue assessment outcomes.  "Journal of Applied Behavior Analysi"s, 45, 779-795.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, although functional assessment has been conducted with a variety host of populations (i.e.&lt;ref&gt;Bonem, M.; Stanely-Klime, K.L. &amp; Corbin, M. (2008). A behavioral approach to domestic violence: A functional assessment based on batter contingencies. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(2) 210–3 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;) much of the current functional assessment research has been limited to children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gadaire, D.M.; Kelley, M.E. &amp; DeRosa, N.M. (2010). Research Needed for Focusing on Additional Generality of Applied Behavior Analysis. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 11(1), 49–58 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on the use of behavior analysis in the school setting including functional analysis.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25&amp;nbsp;– [[Behavior analysis]]. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology and school psychology both of which focus on the use of functional analysis in the school setting.

The World Association for Behavior Analysis offers a certification for clinical behavior therapy and behavioral consultation, which covers functional analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html|title=World Center for Behavior Analysis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210160227/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html|archivedate=February 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Society for Behaviour Analysis also provides a forum for behavior analysts for accreditation, professional development, continuing education and networking, and serves as an advocate body in public debate on issues relating to behavior analysis. The UK-SBA promotes the ethical and effective application of the principles of behavior and learning to a wide range of areas including education, rehabilitation and health care, business and the community and is committed to maintaining the availability of high-quality evidence-based professional behavior analysis practice in the UK. The society also promotes and supports the academic field of behavior analysis with in the UK both in terms of university-based training and research, and theoretical develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk-sba.org/|title=UK Society for Behaviour Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-World War II period saw flourishing movements of various forms of [[feminism]]; however, the nexus between (economic) development and women was not clearly articulated until the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903247621|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes,|first=Benería,|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria,|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women first came into focus in development as objects of [[welfare]] policies, including those focused on [[birth control]], [[nutrition]], and [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Caroline O.N.|title=Gender planning and development : theory, practice and training|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0415056209|edition=  Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1962 the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the Commission on the Status of Women to prepare a report on the role of women in development.

This article reviews the dominant liberal approaches, including women in development (WID), women and development (WAD), gender and development (GAD) and neoliberal frameworks (Singh, 2007). There is significant overlap among these approaches (for example, WID can be seen as an early version of the neoliberal framework). (GAD) is most concerned with equity and empowerment.

==Early approaches==

===Women in development (WID)===
'''Theoretical approach'''

The term “women in development” was originally coined by a Washington-based network of female development professionals in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Tinker1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irene Tinker|title=Persistent Inequalities: Women and World Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6aCgdeafDAC|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506158-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought to question [[trickle down effect|trickle down]] existing theories of development by contesting that economic development had identical impacts on men and women.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=2 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women in Development movement (WID) gained momentum in the 1970s, driven by the resurgence of women's movements in developed countries, and particularly through liberal feminists striving for equal rights and labour opportunities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=3 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal feminism]], postulating that women's disadvantages in society may be eliminated by breaking down customary expectations of women by offering better education to women and introducing equal opportunity programmes,&lt;ref name="Connell1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Connell|title=Gender and power: society, the person, and sexual politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qywNrBHAGxwC|year=1987|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a notable influence on the formulation of the WID approaches.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt;

The focus of the 1970s [[feminist movements]] and their repeated calls for employment opportunities in the development agenda meant that particular attention was given to the productive labour of women, leaving aside reproductive concerns and social welfare.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt; This approach was pushed forward by WID advocates, reacting to the general policy environment maintained by early colonial authorities and post-war development authorities, wherein inadequate reference to the work undertook by women as producers was made, as they were almost solely identified as their roles as wives and mothers.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p3"/&gt; The WID's opposition to this “welfare approach” was in part motivated by the work of Danish economist [[Ester Boserup]] in the early 1970s, who challenged the assumptions of the said approach and highlighted the role women by women in the agricultural production and economy.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=4 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A dominant strand of thinking within WID sought to link women's issues with development, highlighting how such issues acted as impediments to economic growth; this “relevance” approach stemmed from the experience of WID advocates which illustrated that it was more effective if demands of equity and social justice for women were strategically linked to mainstream development concerns, in an attempt to have WID policy goals taken up by development agencies.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995p6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=6 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women in Development approach was the first contemporary movement to specifically integrate women in the broader development agenda and acted as the precursor to later movements such as the Women and Development (WAD), and ultimately, the Gender and Development approach, departing from some of the criticized aspects imputed to the WID.

'''Criticism'''

The WID movement faced a number of criticisms; such an approach had in some cases the unwanted consequence of depicting women as a unit whose claims are conditional on its productive value, associating increased female status with the value of cash income in women's lives.&lt;ref name="Razavi1995pi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=Shahrashoub  |last2=Miller |first2=Carol |year=1995 |title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual shifts in the Women and Development discourse |url=http://unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/d9c3fca78d3db32e80256b67005b6ab5/$FILE/opb1.pdf |journal=United Nations Research Institute Occasional Paper series |publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development |volume=1 |page=i |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID view and similar classifications based on Western feminism, applied a general definition to the status, experiences and contributions of women and the solutions for women in Third World countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41445662|title=Producing women and progress in Zimbabwe : narratives of identity and work from the 1980s|last=1949-|first=Sylvester, Christine,|date=2000|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0325000700|location=Portsmouth, NH|oclc=41445662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the WID, although it advocated for greater [[gender equality]], did not tackle the unequal gender relations and roles at the basis of women's exclusion and gender subordination rather than addressing the stereotyped expectations entertained by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unsdsn.org/files/2013/05/130520-Women-Economic-Development-Paper-for-HLP.pdf |title=Women’s role in economic development:  Overcoming the constraints |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Sarah |date=May 2013 |website=UNSDSN |publisher=UNSDSN |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the underlying assumption behind the call for the integration of the [[Third World]] women with their national economy was that women were not already participating in development, thus downplaying women's roles in household production and informal economic and political activities.&lt;ref name="Koczberski1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koczberski |first=Sarah |year=1998 |title=Women In Development: A Critical Analysis |journal=Third World Quarterly |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=19 |issue=3 |page=399 |doi=10.1080/01436599814316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID was also criticized for its views on the fact that women's status will improve by moving into “productive employment”, implying that the move to the “modern sector” need to be made from the “traditional” sector to achieve self-advancement, further implying that “traditional” work roles often occupied by women in the developing world were inhibiting to self-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koczberski |first=Sarah |year=1998 |title=Women In Development: A Critical Analysis |journal=Third World Quarterly |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=19 |issue=3 |page=400 |doi=10.1080/01436599814316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and development (WAD)===

Women and development (WAD) is a theoretical and practical approach to development. It was introduced into [[gender studies]] scholarship in the second half of the 1970s, following its origins, which can be traced to the [[First World Conference on Women]] in Mexico City in 1975,&lt;ref name="choike.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/mexico.html|title=First World Conference on Women, Mexico 1975|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unsystem.org/content/first-world-conference-women-1975|title=First World Conference on Women (1975) {{!}} United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination|website=www.unsystem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a departure from the previously predominant theory, WID (Women in Development) and is often mistaken for WID, but has many distinct characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Theoretical approach'''

WAD arose out of a shift in thinking about women's role in development, and concerns about the explanatory limitations of [[modernization theory]].&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"&gt;Rathgeber, Eva M. 1990. “WID, WAD, GAD: Trends in Research and Practice.” The Journal of Developing Areas. 24(4) 289-502&lt;/ref&gt; While previous thinking held that development was a vehicle to advance women, new ideas suggested that development was only made possible by the involvement of women, and rather than being simply passive recipients of [[development aid]], they should be actively involved in development projects.&lt;ref name="choike.org"/&gt; WAD took this thinking a step further and suggested that women have always been an integral part of development, and did not suddenly appear in the 1970s as a result of exogenous development efforts.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt; The WAD approach suggests that there be women-only development projects that were theorized to remove women from the patriarchal hegemony that would exist if women participated in development alongside men in a patriarchal culture, though this concept has been heavily debated by theorists in the field.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barriteau | first1 = Eudine | last2 = Connelly | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Parpart | first3 = Jane L | author-link1 = Eudine Barriteau | title = Theoretical perspectives on gender and development | publisher = International Development Research Centre (IDRC) | location = Ottawa | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780889369108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, WAD is differentiated from WID by way of the theoretical framework upon which it was built. Rather than focus specifically on women's relationship to development, WAD focuses on the relationship between patriarchy and capitalism. This theory seeks to understand women's issues from the perspectives of [[neo-Marxism]]  and [[dependency theory]], though much of the theorizing about WAD remains undocumented due to the persistent and pressing nature of development work in which many WAD theorists engage.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"/&gt;

'''Practical approach'''

The WAD paradigm stresses the relationship between women, and the work that they perform in their societies as economic agents in both the public and domestic spheres. It also emphasizes the distinctive nature of the roles women play in the maintenance and development of their societies, with the understanding that purely the integration of women into development efforts would serve to reinforce the existing structures of inequality present in societies overrun by patriarchal interests. In general, WAD is thought to offer a more critical conceptualization of women's position that does WID.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt;

The WAD approach emphasizes the distinctive nature of women's knowledge, work, goals, and responsibilities, as well as advocating for the recognition of their distinctiveness. This fact, combined with a recognized tendency for development agencies to be dominated by patriarchal interests, is at the root of the women-only initiatives introduced by WAD subscribers.&lt;ref name="Parpart, Jane L. 2000"/&gt;

'''Criticism'''

Some of the common critiques of the WAD approach include concerns that the women-only development projects would struggle, or ultimately fail, due to their scale, and the marginalized status of these women. Furthermore, the WAD perspective suffers from a tendency to view women as a class, and pay little attention to the differences among women (such as feminist concept of [[intersectionality]]), including race and ethnicity, and prescribe development endeavors that may only serve to address the needs of a particular group. While an improvement on WID, WAD fails to fully consider the relationships between [[patriarchy]], modes of production, and the marginalization of women. It also presumes that the position of women around the world will improve when international conditions become more equitable. Additionally, WAD has been criticized for its singular preoccupation with the productive side of women's work, while it ignores the reproductive aspect of women's work and lives. Therefore, WID/WAD intervention strategies have tended to concentrate on the development of income-generating activities without taking into account the time burdens that such strategies place on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pepe|first=Roberts|date=April 1979|title=The Integration of Women into the Development Process: Some Conceptual Problem|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/10815/IDSB_10_3_10.1111-j.1759-5436.1979.mp10003013.x.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=IDS Bulletin|volume=10 (3)|pages=60–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Value is placed on income-generating activities, and none is ascribed to social and cultural reproduction.&lt;ref name="Rathgeber, Eva M 1990"/&gt;

===Gender and development (GAD)===
'''Theoretical approach'''

The Gender and Development (GAD) approach focuses on the socially constructed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Tietcheu|title=Being Women and Men in Africa Today: Approaching Gender Roles in Changing African Societies|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  differences between men and women, the need to challenge existing gender roles and relations,&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation and effects of class differences on development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This approach was majorly influenced by the writings of academic scholars such as Oakley (1972) and Rubin (1975), who argue the social relationship between men and women have systematically subordinated women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Caroline|title=Gender Planning and Development. Theory, Practice and Training|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Planning and Development. Theory, Practice and Training|last=Moser|first=Caroline|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0-203-41194-3|location=New York|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with economist scholars Lourdes Benería and Amartya Sen (1981), who assess the impact of colonialism on development and gender inequality. They state that colonialism imposed more than a 'value system' upon developing nations, it introduced a system of economics 'designed to promote capital accumulation which caused class differentiation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

GAD departs from WID, which discussed women's subordination and lack of inclusion in discussions of international development without examining broader systems of gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by this work, by the late 1970s, some practitioners working in the development field questioned focusing on women in isolation.&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GAD challenged the WID focus on women as an important ‘target group’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘untapped resources’ for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Caroline|title=Gender Planning and Development. Theory, Practice and Training|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-41194-3 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAD marked a shift in thinking about the need to understand how women and men are socially constructed and how ‘those constructions are powerfully reinforced by the social activities that both define and are defined by them.’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; GAD focuses primarily on the gendered division of labor and gender as a relation of power embedded in institutions.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8" /&gt; Consequently, two major frameworks ‘Gender roles’ and ‘social relations analysis’ are used in this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Gender roles' focuses on the social construction of identities within the household; it also reveals the expectations from ‘maleness and femaleness’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; in their relative access to resources. 'Social relations analysis' exposes the social dimensions of hierarchical power relations embedded in social institutions, as well as its determining influence on ‘the relative position of men and women in society.’&lt;ref name="Razavi 1995 12" /&gt; This relative positioning tends to discriminate against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike WID, the GAD approach is not concerned specifically with women, but with the way in which a society assigns roles, responsibilities and expectations to both women and men. GAD applies [[gender analysis]] to uncover the ways in which men and women work together, presenting results in neutral terms of economics and efficiency.{{sfn|Shifting views...}}In an attempt to create gender equality, (denoting women having same opportunities as men, including ability to participate in the public sphere;&lt;ref&gt;Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 1998, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; GAD policies aims to redefine traditional gender role expectations. Women are expected to fulfill household management tasks, home based production as well as bearing and raising children and caring for family members. The role of a wife is largely interpreted as 'the responsibilities of motherhood'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahrashoub|author2=Carol Miller|title=From WID to GAD: Conceptual Shifts in the Women and Development Discourse|date=1 February 1995|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men however, are expected to be breadwinners whom are associated with paid work, and market production.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 8" /&gt; In the labor market, women tend to earn less than men. For instance, 'a study by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found massive pay inequities in some United Kingdom's top finance companies, women received around 80 percent less performance-related pay than their male colleagues.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prügl|first=Elizabeth|title=''If Lehman Brothers Had Been Lehman Sisters...'': Gender and Myth in the Aftermath of the Financial Crisis|journal=International Political Sociology|date=14 March 2012|volume=6|issue=1|page=25|doi=10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00149.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to pervasive gender inequalities, [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] established [[gender mainstreaming]] in 1995 as a strategy across all policy areas at all levels of governance for achieving gender equality.

[[Caroline Moser]] developed the [[Moser Gender Planning Framework]] for GAD-oriented development planning in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit of the [[University of London]]. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning.{{sfn|March|Smyth|Mukhopadhyay|1999|pp = 55}}
The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations.
As with the WID-based [[Harvard Analytical Framework]], it includes a collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. 
The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing work and household responsibilities, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|pp = 126}}

'''Criticisms'''

GAD has been criticized for emphasizing the social differences between men and women while neglecting the bonds between them and also the potential for changes in roles. Another criticism is that GAD does not dig deeply enough into social relations and so may not explain how these relations can undermine programs directed at women. It also does not uncover the types of trade-offs that women are prepared to make for the sake of achieving their ideals of marriage or motherhood.{{sfn|Shifting views...}} Another criticism is that the GAD perspective is theoretically distinct from WID, but in practice, a program seem to have the element of the two. Whilst many development agencies are now committed to a gender approach, in practice, the primary institutional perspective remain focused on a WID approach.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeves|first=Hazel|title=Gender and Development: Concepts and Definitions|year=2000|location=Brighton|isbn=1 85864 381 3|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a slippage in reality where gender mainstreaming is often based in a single normative perspective as synonymous to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=True|first=J|title=Feminist Strategies in Global Governance: Gender Mainstreaming|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development agencies still advance gender transformation to mean economic betterment for women.&lt;ref name="Reeves 2000 33" /&gt;

==Neoliberal approaches==

===Gender and neoliberal development institutions===
Neoliberalism consist of policies that will privatize public industry, deregulate any laws or policies that interfere with the free flow of the market and cut back on all social services. This policies were often introduced to many low-income countries through structural adjustment programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development, and Globalization:Economics as if All People Mattered.|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|last2=Berik|first2=Gunseli|last3=Floro|first3=Maria S|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-53748-3|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberalism was cemented as the dominant global policy framework in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among development institutions, gender issues have increasingly become part of economic development agendas, as the examples of the [[World Bank]] shows. Awareness by international organizations of the need to address gender issues evolved over the past decades. The World Bank, and regional development banks, donor agencies, and government ministries have provided many examples of instrumental arguments for gender equality, for instance by emphasizing the importance of women's education as a way of increasing productivity in the household and the market. Their concerns have often focused on women's contributions to economic growth rather than the importance of women's education as a means for empowering women and enhancing their capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benería |first1=Lourdes |last2=Günseli |first2=Berik |last3=Floro |first3=Maria S. |title=Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics As If All People Mattered |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |edition= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Bank, for example, started focusing on gender in 1977 with the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser.&lt;ref name="WB Gender"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/overview |title=World Bank Gender Overview |author= |date=3 May 2013 |website=World Bank |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the bank mandated that its programs consider women's issues. In 1994 the bank issued a policy paper on Gender and Development, reflecting current thinking on the subject. This policy aims to address policy and institutional constraints that maintain disparities between the genders and thus limit the effectiveness of development programs.{{sfn|World Bank 2010}}Thirty years after the appointment of a first Women in Development Adviser, a so-called [[Gender Action Plan]] was launched to underline the importance of the topic within development strategies and to introduce the new [[gender and development#smart economics|Smart Economics]] strategy. In 2012, the [[World Development Report]] was the first report of the series examining Gender Equality and Development.&lt;ref name="WB Gender"/&gt;

=== Gender and microfinance ===
Women have been identified by some development institutions as a key to successful development, for example through financial inclusion. Microcredit is giving small loans to people in poverty without collateral. This was first started by [[Muhammad Yunus]], who formed the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microworld.org/en/about-microworld/about-microcredit|title=Story of the microcredit|website=www.microworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have showed that women are more likely to repay their debt than men, and the Grameen Bank focuses on aiding women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Microfinance|last=Armendáriz|first=Beatriz|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=9780262014106|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This financial opportunity allows women to start their own businesses for a steady income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H|first=Scott|date=2006|title=Book Review: Banker to the Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle against World Poverty|url=|journal=Review of Radical Political Economics|volume=38|pages=280–283|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous case studies done in Tanzania about the correlation of the role of [[Microfinance in Tanzania|SACCoS]] and the economic development of the country. The research showed that the microfinance policies were not being carried out in the most efficient ways due to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=James R.|date=November 2006|title=BLOOD ENEMIES: EXPLOITATION AND URBAN CITIZENSHIP IN THE NATIONALIST POLITICAL THOUGHT OF TANZANIA, 1958–75|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/blood-enemies-exploitation-and-urban-citizenship-in-the-nationalist-political-thought-of-tanzania-195875/15088D32000B00E267CF7D8CD49E715E|journal=The Journal of African History|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=389–413|doi=10.1017/S0021853706001794|issn=1469-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was evidence that reform could possibly enrich the overall economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=Xuezhi|last2=Ndiege|first2=Benson Otieno|date=2013-04-08|title=Role of Financial Development in Economic Growth: Evidence from Savings and Credits Cooperative Societies in Tanzania|url=http://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijfr/article/view/2660|journal=International Journal of Financial Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=115|doi=10.5430/ijfr.v4n2p115|issn=1923-4031}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case study went a step further to claim that this financial service could provide a more equal society for women in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Lucy-George|date=April 22, 2014|title=The Impact of Microfinance on Female Entrepreneurs in Tanzania|url=https://publications.lakeforest.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=seniortheses|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are such cases in which women were able to lift themselves out of poverty, there are also cases in which women fell into a poverty trap as they were unable to repay their loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/11/01/500093608/you-asked-we-answer-can-tiny-loans-lift-women-out-of-poverty|title=You Asked, We Answer: Can Microloans Lift Women Out Of Poverty?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even said that microcredit is actually an "anti-developmental" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman, Chang|first=Milford, Ha-Joon|date=2012|title=Microfinance and the Illusion of Development: From Hubris to Nemesis in Thirty Years|url=http://wer.worldeconomicsassociation.org/files/WER-Vol1-No1-Article2-Bateman-and-Chang-v2.pdf|journal=World Economic Review|volume=1|pages=13–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence of significant development for these women within the 30 years that the microfinance has been around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization: economics as if all people mattered|last=Benería|first=Lourdes|publisher=New York ; London : Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=9780415537483|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, unemployment is high due to the introduction of microfinance, more so than it was under apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=Galiani|first2=Sebastian|last3=Levinsohn|first3=Jim|last4=McLaren|first4=Zoë|last5=Woolard|first5=Ingrid|title=Why Has Unemployment Risen in the New South Africa |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13167 |date=June 2007 |doi=10.3386/w13167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microcredit intensified poverty in Johannesburg, South Africa as poor communities, mostly women, who needed to repay debt were forced to work in the informal sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jennifer|date=July 2010|title=How the global economic crisis reaches marginalised workers: the case of street traders in Johannesburg, South Africa|url=|journal=Gender and Development|volume=18|pages=277–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is debate on how effective microcredit is in alleviating poverty in general, there is an argument that microcredit enables women to participate and fulfill their capabilities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lott|first=Charlotte E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Why Women Matter: the Story of Microcredit |journal=Journal of Law and Commerce|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|doi=10.5195/jlc.2009.28|issn=2164-7984}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study conducted in Malayasia showed that their version of microcredit, AIM, had a positive effect on Muslim women's empowerment in terms of allowing them to have more control over family planning and over decisions that were made in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Shami|first=Sayed Samer Ali|last2=Razali|first2=Muhammad M.|last3=Majid|first3=Izaidin|last4=Rozelan|first4=Ahmed|last5=Rashid|first5=Nurulizwa|date=2016-07-02|title=The effect of microfinance on women’s empowerment: Evidence from Malaysia|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F12259276.2016.1205378|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=318–337|doi=10.1080/12259276.2016.1205378|issn=1225-9276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the Women's Development Business (WDB) in South Africa, a [[Grameen Bank]] microfinance replicator. According to WDB, the goal is to ensure “[…] that rural women are given the tools to free themselves from the chains of poverty […]” through allocation of financial resources directly to women including enterprise development programs.&lt;ref name="WDB"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wdb.co.za/about/#.UpUPR-KmZRc |title=WDB about page |author= |year= 2013 |website=Women’s Development Business |publisher=WDB |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to use microfinance as a market-oriented tool to ensure access to financial services for disadvantaged and low-income people and therefore fostering economic development through [[financial inclusion]].

As a reaction, a current topic in the feminist literature on economic development is the ‘gendering’ of [[microfinance]], as women have increasingly become the target borrowers for rural [[microcredit]] lending. This, in turn, creates the assumption of a “rational economic woman” which can exacerbate existing social hierarchies&lt;ref name="Rankin2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rankin |first=Katharine N. |year=2001 |title= Governing Development: Neoliberalism, Microcredit, and Rational Economic Woman |url= http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan011685.pdf |journal= Economy and Society |publisher=Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme |volume=30 |pages=20 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |doi=10.1080/03085140122912}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 
Therefore, the critique is that the assumption of economic development through microfinance does not take into account all possible outcomes, especially the ones affecting women.

The impact of programs of the [[Bretton Woods Institutions]] and other similar organizations on gender are being monitored by Gender Action, a watchdog group founded in 2002 by Elaine Zuckerman who is a former World Bank economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genderaction.org/who.html|title=About Us: Who We Are|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Gender Action|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Suzanna|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Elaine|date=2008|title=Mapping Multilateral Development Banks' Spending on Reproductive Health and HIV and AIDS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20461274|journal=Gender and Development|volume=16|issue=2|pages=287–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender, financial crises, and neoliberal economic policy===
The [[global financial crisis]] and the following politics of austerity have opened up a wide range of gender and feminist debates on neoliberalism and the impact of the crisis on women. One view is that the crisis has affected women disproportionately and that there is a need for alternative economic structures in which investment in social reproduction needs to be given more weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/genderconfyork/elson-and-pearson-keynote |title=Keynote of Diane Elson and Ruth Pearson at the Gender, Neoliberalism and Financial Crisis Conference at the University of York |last1=Elson |first1=Diane |last2=Pearson |first2=Ruth |date=27 September 2013 |website=Soundcloud |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last=Benería  Lourdes, Günseli Berik and Maria S. Floro|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) assessed the impact of the global financial crisis on workers and concluded that while the crisis initially affected industries that were dominated by male workers (such as finance, construction and manufacturing) it then spread over to sectors in which female workers are predominantly active. Examples for these sectors are the service sector or wholesale retail trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/magazines-and-journals/world-of-work-magazine/articles/WCMS_120081/lang--en/index.htm |title=Financial crisis: The gender dimension |last1=International Labour Organization |date=1 April 2009 |website=ILO |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different views among feminists on whether neoliberal economic policies have more positive or negative impacts on women. In the post-war era, feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson1977"&gt;{{cite book |author=Elizabeth Wilson |title= Women and the Welfare State  |url= https://www.amazon.com/Women-Welfare-State-Routledge-1977/dp/B00DHPQZPO |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  criticized [[state capitalism]] and the [[welfare state]] as a tool to oppress women. Therefore, neoliberal economic policies featuring [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]], hence a reduction of the influence of the state and more individual freedom was argued to improve conditions for women. This anti-welfare state thinking arguably led to feminist support for neoliberal ideas embarking on a [[macroeconomic policy]] level deregulation and a reduced role of the state.

Therefore, some scholars in the field argue that [[feminism]], especially during its [[second-wave feminism|second wave]], has contributed key ideas to Neoliberalism that, according to these authors, creates new forms of inequality and exploitation.&lt;ref name="Fraser2012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Nancy |year=2012 |title= Feminism, Capitalism, and the Cunning of History |url= http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/72/50/55/PDF/FMSH-WP-2012-17_Fraser1.pdf |journal=Working paper |publisher=Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme  |pages=14 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to the phenomenon that some forms of feminism are increasingly interwoven with capitalism, many suggestions on how to name these movements have emerged in the feminist literature. Examples are ‘free market feminism’ &lt;ref name="Eisenstein2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenstein |first=Hester |year=2009 |title= Feminism Seduced: How Global Elites Use Women’s Labor and Ideas to Exploit the World |url= http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/feminism-seduced-hester-eisenstein/1101405471?ean=9781594516597&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=9781594516597 |location=Boulder |publisher= Paradigm Publishers |isbn= 1594516596 |accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even ‘faux-feminism’.&lt;ref name="McRobbie2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=McRobbie |first=Angela |year=2009 |title= The Aftermath of Feminism: Gender, Culture and Social Change |url= http://product.half.ebay.com/The-Aftermath-of-Feminism-Gender-Culture-and-Social-Change-by-Angela-McRobbie-2008-Paperback/2879527&amp;cpid=1169202753 |location=London |publisher= Sage |isbn= 0761970622 |accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart economics===
'''Theoretical approaches'''
Advocated chiefly by the [[World Bank]], smart economics is an approach to define gender equality as an integral part of economic development and it aims to spur development through investing more efficiently in women and girls. It stresses that the gap between men and women in [[human capital]], economic opportunities, and voice/agency is a chief obstacle in achieving more efficient development. As an approach, it is a direct descendant of the efficiency approach taken by WID which “rationalizes ‘investing’ in women and girls for more effective development outcomes.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chant|first=Sylvia|author2=Sweetman, Caroline|title=Fixing women or fixing the world? ‘Smart economics’, efficiency approaches, and gender equality in development| journal=Gender &amp; Development| date=November 2012|volume=20|issue=3|pages=517–529|doi=10.1080/13552074.2012.731812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chant|first=S.|title=The disappearing of 'smart economics'?

Its approach identifies women are relatively underinvested source of development and it defines [[gender equality]] an opportunity of higher return investment. “Gender equality itself is here depicted as smart economics, in that it enables women to contribute their utmost skills and energies to the project of world economic development.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   In this term, smart economics champions neoliberal perspective in seeing business as a vital vehicle for change and it takes a stance of [[liberal feminism]].

The thinking behind smart economics dates back, at least, to the lost decade of the [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment]] Policies (SAPs) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt; In 1995, World Bank issued its flagship publication on gender matters of the year Enhancing Women's Participation in Economic Development (World Bank 1995). This report marked a critical foundation to the naissance of Smart Economics; in a chapter entitled ‘The Pay-offs to Investing in Women,’ the Bank proclaimed that investing in women “speeds economic development by raising productivity and promoting the more efficient use of resources; it produces significant social returns, improving child survival and reducing fertility, and it has considerable intergenerational pay-offs.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=World Bank|title=Enhancing Women’s Participation in Economic Development|year=1995|issue=Washington, DC: World Bank|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bank also emphasized its associated social benefits generated by investing in women. For example, the Bank turned to researches of Whitehead that evidenced a greater female-control of household income is associated with better outcomes for children's welfare &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=edited by Kate|title=Of marriage and the market : women's subordination internationally and its lessons|year=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=9780710202932|page=Whitehead, A. (1984) ‘I’m hungry, mum: the politics of domestic budgeting.’|edition=  2nd |author2=Wolkowitz, Carol|author3= McCullagh, Roslyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Jeffery and Jeffery who analyzed the positive correlation between female education and lower fertility rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=edited by Cecile|title=Feminist visions of development : gender analysis and policy|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415157900|page=Jeffrey, P., &amp; Jeffrey, R. (1998). Silver Bullet or Passing Fancy? Girl’s Schooling and Population Policy.|edition=  1st publ.|author2=Pearson, Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 2000s, the approach of smart economics came to be further crystallized through various frameworks and initiatives. A first step was World Bank's Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2007-/2010, followed by the “Three Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming 2010-13.” The 2010-13 framework responded to criticisms for its precursor and incorporated some shifts in thematic priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank.|title=Applying Gender Action Plan Lessons: A Three-Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming (2011- 2013).|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/336003-1241561860207/GAPtransitionplan_may25.pdf.|work=World Bank Report|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lastly but not least, the decisive turning point was 2012 marked by its publication of “[[World Development Report]] 2012: Gender Equality and Development.”&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development.|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,contentMDK:22999750~menuPK:8154981~pagePK:64167689~piPK:64167673~theSitePK:7778063,00.html|work=World Development Report|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This Bank's first comprehensive focus on the gender issues was welcomed by various scholars and practitioners, as an indicator of its seriousness. For example, Shahra Razavi appraised the report as ‘a welcome opportunity for widening the intellectual space’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razavi |first=S. |title=‘World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development: An Opportunity Both Welcome and Missed (An Extended Commentary)’ |pages=2 |url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B42004CCC77/(httpInfoFiles)/E90770090127BDFDC12579250058F520/$file/Extended%20Commentary%20WDR%202012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[international organizations]], particular [[UN]] families, have so far endorsed the approach of smart economics. Examining the relationship between child well-being and gender equality, for example, [[UNICEF]] also referred to the “Double Dividend of Gender Equality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UNICEF|title=The state of the world's children 2007: women and children: the double dividend of gender equality.|year=2006|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its explicit link to a wider framework of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (where the Goal 3 is Promoting Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment) claimed a wider legitimacy beyond economic efficiency. In 2007, the Bank proclaimed that “The business case for investing in MDG 3 is strong; it is nothing more than smart economics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=Global Monitoring Report 2007: Millennium Development Goals: Confronting the Challenges of Gender Equality and Fragile States (Vol. 4).|publisher=World Bank-free PDF|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, “Development organisations and governments have been joined in this focus on the ‘business case’ for gender equality and the empowerment of women, by businesses and enterprises which are interested in contributing to social good.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  A good example is “Girl Effect initiative” taken by Nike Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nike Harnesses ‘Girl Effect’ Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/giving/11VIDEO.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its claim for economic imperative and a broader socio-economic impact also met a strategic need of NGOs and community organizations that seeks justification for their program funding.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  Thus, some NGOs, for example [[Plan International]], captured this trend to further their program. The then-president of the World Bank [[Robert B. Zoellick]] was quoted by Plan International in stating “Investing in adolescent girls is precisely the catalyst poor countries need to break intergenerational poverty and to create a better distribution of income. Investing in them is not only fair, it is a smart economic move.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plan International |title=‘Because I Am a Girl: The State of the World’s Girls 2009. Girls in the Global Economy. Adding it All Up.’ |publisher=Plan International |page=11 and 28. |url=http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/BIAAG_Summary_ENGLISH_lo_resolution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The global financial meltdown and austerity measures taken by major donor counties further supported this approach, since [[international financial institutions]] (IFIs) s and international NGOs received a greater pressure from donors and from global public to design and implement maximally cost-effective programs.

'''Criticisms'''
From the mid-2000s, the approach of smart economics and its chief proponent –World Bank– met a wide range of criticisms and denouncements. These discontents can be broadly categorized into three major claims; Subordination of Intrinsic Value; Ignorance for the need of systemic transformation; Feminisation of responsibility; Overemphasized efficiency; and Opportunistic pragmatism.This is not exhaustive list of criticisms, but the list aims to highlight different emphasis among existing criticisms.

Smart economics’ subordination of women under the justification of development invited fierce criticisms. Chant expresses her grave concern that “Smart economics is concerned with building women’s capacities in the interests of development rather than promoting women’s rights for their own sake.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She disagrees that investment in women should be promoted by its instrumental utility: “it is imperative to ask whether the goal of female investment is primarily to promote gender equality and women’s ‘[[empowerment]]’, or to facilitate development ‘on the cheap’, and/or to promote further economic liberalization.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts 2012 949–968"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Adrienne|author2=Soederberg, Susanne|title=Gender Equality as Smart Economics? A critique of the 2012 World Development Report|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=June 2012|volume=33|issue=5|pages=949–968|doi=10.1080/01436597.2012.677310}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although smart economics outlines that gender equality has intrinsic value (realizing gender equality is an end itself) and instrumental value (realizing gender equality is a means to a more efficient development),&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;  many points out that the Bank pays almost exclusive attentions to the latter in defining its framework and strategy. Zuckerman also echoed this point by stating “business case [which] ignores the moral imperative of empowering women to achieve women’s human rights and full equal rights with men.”&lt;ref name="Roberts 2012 949–968"/&gt;  In short, Chant casts a doubt that if it is not “possible to promote rights through [[utilitarianism]].” &lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

A wide range of scholars and practitioners has criticized that smart economics rather endorse the current status-quo of gender inequality and keep silence for the demand of institutional reform. Its approach “[d]oes not involves public action to transform the laws, policies, and practices which constrain personal and group agency.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  [[Naila Kabeer]]  also posits that “attention to collective action to enable women to challenge structural discrimination has been downplayed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabeer|first=Naila|title=Gender mainstreaming in poverty eradication and the Millennium development goals a handbook for policy-makers and other stakeholders|year=2003|publisher=Commonwealth secretariat |location=London|isbn=0-85092-752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply, smart economics assumes that women are entirely capable of increasingly contributing for economic growth amid the ongoing structural barriers to realize their capabilities.

Sylvia Chant (2008) discredited its approach as ‘feminisation of responsibility and/or obligation’ where the smart economics intends to spur growth simply by demanding more from women in terms of time, labour, energy, and other resources.&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She also agrees that “Smart economics seeks to use women and girls to fix the world.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  She further goes by clarifying that “It is less welcome to women who are already contributing vast amounts to both production and unpaid reproduction to be romanticised and depicted as the salvation of the world.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

Chant is concerned that “An efficiency-driven focus on young women and girls as smart economics leaves this critical part of the global population out.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   Smart economics assumes that all women are at their productive stage and fallaciously neglects lives of the elderly women, or women with handicaps. Thus she calls for recognition of “equal rights of all women and girls -regardless of age, or the extent of nature of their economic contribution.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;  Also, its approach does not talk about cooperation and collaboration between males and females thus leaving men and boys completely out of picture.

Chant emphasize that “The smart economics approach represents, at best, pragmatism in a time of economic restructuring and [[austerity]].”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;   Smart economics can have a wider acceptance and legitimacy because now is the time when efficiency is most demanded, not because its utilitarianism has universal appeal. She further warns that feminists should be very cautious about “supporting, and working in coalition with, individuals and institutions who approach gender equality through the lens of smart economics. This may have attractions in strategic terms, enabling us to access resources for work focusing on supporting the individual agency of women and girls, but risks aggravating many of the complex problems that gender and development seeks to transform.”&lt;ref name="Chant and Sweetman (2012)"/&gt;

==Alternative Approaches==
Other approaches with different paradigms have also played a historically important role in advancing theories and practices in gender and development.

===Marxism and Neo-Marxism===
The structuralist debate was first triggered by [[Marxist]] and [[socialist feminist]]s. Marxism, particularly through alternative models of [[state socialist]] development practiced in [[China]] and [[Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Philip C.C.|date=2012-09-17|title=Profit-Making State Firms and China’s Development Experience|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0097700412455839|journal=Modern China|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=591–629|doi=10.1177/0097700412455839|issn=0097-7004}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the dominant liberal approach over time. [[Neo-Marxist]] proponents focused on the role of the [[post-colonial]] state in development in general and also on localized class struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Samir Amin.

===Dependency theory===
Dependency theorists opposed that liberal development models, including the attempt to incorporate women into the existing global capitalism, was in fact nothing more than the "development of [[underdevelopment]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Andre Gunder|title=Capitalism and underdevelopment in Latin America : historical studies of Chile and Brazil|year=1969|publisher=Monthly Review P.|location=New York|isbn=0853450935|edition=  Rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view led them to propose that delinking from the structural oppression of [[global capitalism]] is the only way to achieve balanced human development.  
In the 1980s, there also emerged "a sustained questioning by [[post-structuralist]] critics of the development paradigm as a narrative of progress and as an achievable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by Nalini Visvanathan ... [et|title=The women, gender and development reader|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|isbn=9781848135871|page=29|edition=  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Needs Approach, Capability Approach, and Ecofeminism===
Within the liberal paradigm of women and development, various criticism have emerged. The [[Basic Needs]] (BN) approach began to pose questions to the focus on growth and income as indicators of development. It was heavily influenced by [[Amartya Sen|Sen]] and Nussabaum's [[capability approach]], which was more gender sensitive than BN and focused on expanding human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Development as freedom|year=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0192893300|edition=  1st publ. as an Oxford Univ.

From a perspective of [[sustainable development]], ecofeminists articulated the direct link between [[colonialism]] and environmental degradation, which resulted in degradation of women's lives themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|title=The death of nature : women, ecology, and the scientific revolution : a feminist reappraisal of the scientific revolution|year=1980|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0062505718|edition=  First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]] he co-funds and he becomes member of the [[Rijksakademie]] International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-a-i-n.net RAIN network and website]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically for his interest in supporting art practices, Leye moved back to [[Douala]] in 2002 to create the art centre ArtBakery in Bonendale, devoted specifically to facilitating artistic training and exchanges among artists and to support multimedia, installations, video and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-a-i-n.net/projects/art+bakery/ ArtBakery on RAIN website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he was the curator of the project ''Bessengue City'', a workshop and a series of site-specific art projects in the neighbourhood of [[Bessengue]] in Douala; the project involved Goddy Leye, James Beckett, Hartanto, [[Jesus Palomino]] and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;Video on Bessengue City: [[Sandrine Dole]] and Goddy Leye, ''Bessengue City'', 2002–2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he promoted and participated in ''Exit Tour''.

In 2008 he was in residency at the Gasworks cultural space in London;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/detail.php?id=356 Goddy Leye's residency at Gasworks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204223257/http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/detail.php?id=356 |date=4 December 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 he participated at the project ''Image Art After'' in dialogue with [[Florence Ayisi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagineartafter.org/dialogues/dialogues-2009/goddy-leye-and-florence-ayisi/ Imagine Art After].&lt;/ref&gt; and he contributed at the Cairo Residency Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crs.nu/Cairo_Residency_Symposium/Info_art_bakery.html Goddy Leye at the Cairo Residency Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190346/http://www.crs.nu/Cairo_Residency_Symposium/Info_art_bakery.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leye's work received prizes from [[UNESCO]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowave.com/?language=EN&amp;section=artists&amp;id_artist=148 Goddy Leye's biography on lowave].&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist and intellectual, he was involved in numerous expert committees; he was a member of the think tank of the Africa Centre in Cape Town and was an ambassador of CAN (Creative Africa Network).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeafricanetwork.com CAN Creative Africa Network].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Leye started working as an artist in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goddyleye.lecktronix.net/favorite_links_1.html Goddy Leye'CV on his website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723180604/http://goddyleye.lecktronix.net/favorite_links_1.html |date=23 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His work was focussed on memory, African [[postcolonialism]] and on the construction of history. More specifically he expressed himself with multimedia works, videos and video installations. Through time, he started to be involved more and more in the production of projects both in Cameroon and at an international level. He contributed to publications, produced and curated site-specific artworks and founded the centre ArtBakery. The centre offers tools and an infrastructure to artists interested in multimedia productions and it is characterised by an active role in training. Leye was considered a key artist and intellectual by Cameroonian artists of his generation and younger.

Leye expressed his attention to the ways history is told and knowledge is transmitted and forgotten through his art works, writings and his active involvement in conferences and think tanks. His theoretical contributions focused on the structure of cultural institutions, on network systems, on artistic and cultural practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymotion.virgilio.it/video/x69rs4_goddye-leye_creation Video with a conversation on artistic practices] between Goddy Leye, [[Lionel Manga]] and [[Hervé Yamguen]].&lt;/ref&gt; and on urban transformations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12714">'''Green Dot Bystander Intervention''' is a [[bystander education]] approach that aims to prevent violence with the help of bystanders. It is built on the premise that violence can be measurably and systematically reduced within a community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bystander intervention as a way of [[violence]] prevention programs are becoming popular within society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its mission is to reduce [[Violence against women|power based-violence]] by being a proactive bystander and a reactive bystander.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;"Title IX." ''End Rape On Campus''. End Rape On Campus. Web. http://endrapeoncampus.org/title-ix/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Green Dot Etc. Overview." ''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program was founded by Dr. Dorothy Edwards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The program trains people about [[sexual assault]] and [[domestic violence]] on college campuses, primary and secondary schools, and communities. It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by "accidentally" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the [[University of Kentucky student life|University of Kentucky's]] Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the [[University of Kentucky]] she was training 3,500 students and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault|bystanders in The White House]]. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and [[Futures Without Violence|Coaching Boys Into Men]] are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes.

=== Title IX ===
[[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|1972 Education Amendment]] is a tool meant to combat campus violence. The law requires colleges and universities to fight [[gender-based violence]], [[harassment]], and respond to the needs of survivors promoting equal educational access.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;"Title IX in Detail." ''Know Your IX: Empowering Students to Stop Sexual Violence.'' http://knowyourix.org/title-ix/title-ix-in-detail/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;"Sexual Harassment &amp; Assault."

=== Sexual assault in education ===
[[Sexual violence]] in schools and on campuses is a pressing civil rights issue.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to the National Women's Law Center students who suffer from [[sexual assault]] and [[harassment]] are deprived the liberty of equal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A majority of sexual assaults involving college students also involve drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for [[rape]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The goal of Green Dot is to implement a [[bystander intervention]] strategy that prevents and reduces power-based personal violence.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cherkis, Jason, and Ryan Grim. "Here's How You Can Help Stop A Sexual Assault Before It Happens." ''The Huffington Post'' 9 July 2015, Politics sec.

The curriculum is created from the concepts and lessons learned through research and theory across disciplines including: [[violence against women]], diffusion of innovation, [[public health]], [[Social networking service|social networking]], [[psychology]], [[Bystander effect|bystander dynamics]], perpetration, and marketing/advertising.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Green Dot Etc.

== Training  ==
Green Dot develops programs, strategies, curriculum, and training courses designed to address power-based personal violence across environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Training strategies include: strategic planning, bystander mobilization, communication, and [[Coalition|coalition building]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;"Green Dot Faculty &amp; Staff Toolkit." ''University of Portland''. Office on Violence Against Women. Web. http://www.up.edu/showimage/show.aspx?file=21219&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides training courses for leadership and professionals that focus on the core areas necessary for successful implementation of the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Smith, Carol. "A Dangerous Mix: Drinking, Sex, and College Students." ''InvestigateWest''. InvestigateWest, 2010. Web. http://invw.org/2010/02/25/940/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"The Green Dot Etc. Training." ''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot bystander program uses four training modules to educate bystanders on their impact. 
# The first module provides bystanders with an overview of the strategy, where key definitions and strategies are discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"An Overview of the Green Dot Strategy." ''California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA)''. California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Web. http://www.calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Curriculum-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# The second module  reviews the observable behaviors associated with the major forms of power-based violence and educates about how to recognize potential dangerous or harmful situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# Module three educates bystanders on obstacles within themselves that stop them from intervening. 
#* There are three major categories of influence it uses:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
#** The categories are personal, relationship, and general issues, which impact the way in which individuals intervene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Personal characteristics may include being shy, fearful, or uncertain and not wanting to risk embarrassment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Relationship characteristics involve not wanting to upset friends or a party policer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; General issues include the belief that someone else will intervene, the risk of embarrassment, or creating a scene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Module four focuses on building skills and generating confidence in the performance of the program. 
#* There are two types of Green Dots: proactive and reactive. The goal of proactive Green Dots is to set the two norms that are communicated: violence will not be tolerated and everyone is expected to do his or her part to contribute to fostering a safe community. Reactive Green Dots are done in reaction to seeing concerning behavior or potential dangers, either to stop them from happening or decrease the likelihood they will get worse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; distract,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and delegate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Through Distraction a [[wikt:bystander|bystander]] can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic  situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Examples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Examples of reactive Green Dots include: ''directly'' confronting a situation, ''distracting'' by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or ''delegating'' by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, police offer, etc.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Case studies ===

Ann Coker at the [[University of Kentucky|University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women]] (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of [[Sexual violence|sexual violence perpetration]] by students at schools that received Green Dot training.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hautala, Keith. "'Green Dot' Effective at Reducing Sexual Violence." ''University of Kentucky News: UKNOW''. College of Arts and Sciences, 10 Sept. 2014. Web. http://uknow.uky.edu/content/green-dot-effective-reducing-sexual-violence&lt;/ref&gt; The CRVAW study also found a 40% reduction in self-reported frequency of total violence perpetration including [[sexual violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[stalking]], and [[dating violence]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, A. L., P. G. Cook-Craig, C. M. Williams, B. S. Fisher, E. R. Clear, L. S. Garcia, and L. M. Hegge. "Evaluation of Green Dot: An Active Bystander Intervention to Reduce Sexual Violence on College Campuses." ''Violence Against Women'' 17.6 (2011): 777-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Hermann Reinheimer''' (born, 1872) was a British [[biologist]] and early science writer who proposed [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation in evolution]] and [[symbiogenesis]].

==Biography==

Reinheimer was a critic of Darwinian view of [[struggle for existence]]. He was the author of ''Evolution by Cooperation'' (1913) and ''Symbiogenesis'' (1915) which were influential in developing the concept of [[symbiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, F. H. (1914). ''Evolution by Cooperation by Hermann Reinheimer''. ''[[The Journal of Race Development]]''. Vol. 5, No. 1. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to science historian [[Jan Sapp]] "Reinheimer is virtually unknown among contemporary biologists and historians."&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan (1994). ''Evolution by Association : A History of Symbiosis: A History of Symbiosis''. Oxford University Press. pp. 60-61. {{ISBN|0-19-508821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1915, Reinheimer was one of the first writers to discuss [[symbiogenesis]]. However, the term was used without reference to [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] who had previously written on the subject, leading cell biologist Francisco Carrapiço to speculate that Reinheimer was unfamiliar with his work.&lt;ref name="Carrapiço 2015"&gt;Carrapiço, Francisco.

'''Impunity''' means "exemption from punishment or loss or escape from fines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/impunity |title=Free Dictionary |publisher=Free Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[international law]] of [[human rights]], it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of [[human rights violations]] to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to [[justice]] and [[Legal remedy|redress]]. Impunity is especially common in countries that lack a tradition of the [[rule of law]], suffer from [[Political corruption|corruption]] or that have entrenched systems of [[patronage]], or where the [[judiciary]] is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special [[jurisdiction]]s or [[immunity from prosecution|immunities]].

The amended ''Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity'', submitted to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] on 8 February 2005, defines impunity as:
:"the impossibility, ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'', of bringing the perpetrators of violations to account – whether in criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings – since they are not subject to any inquiry that might lead to their being accused, arrested, tried and, if found guilty, sentenced to appropriate penalties, and to making reparations to their victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html |title=Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity |publisher=Derechos.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Principle of that same document states that:
:"Impunity arises from a failure by States to meet their obligations to investigate violations; to take appropriate measures in respect of the perpetrators, particularly in the area of justice, by ensuring that those suspected of criminal responsibility are prosecuted, tried and duly punished; to provide victims with effective remedies and to ensure that they receive reparation for the injuries suffered; to ensure the inalienable right to know the truth about violations; and to take other necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of violations."

[[Truth and reconciliation commission]]s are frequently established by nations emerging from periods marked by human rights violations – [[coup d'état|coups d'état]], [[military dictatorship]]s, [[civil war]]s, etc. – in order to cast light on the events of the past. While such mechanisms can assist in the ultimate prosecution of crimes and punishment of the guilty, they have often been criticised for perpetuating impunity by enabling violators to seek protection of concurrently adopted [[amnesty law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-next-international-justice "What Next for International Justice?"]''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of the Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]], adopted on 17 July 1998 and entered into force on 1 July 2002, is "to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators" [...] "of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;[Preamble, Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">Information Oriented Software Development is a [[software development methodology]] focused on working with [[information]] inside a computer program as opposed to working with just data. A significant difference exists between data and information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Data_vs_Information] Data vs. Information&lt;/ref&gt; Information Oriented Software Development relies on data structures specifically designed to hold information, and relies on frameworks that support those data structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InformationOriented] Information Oriented&lt;/ref&gt; Information oriented software development focuses on the conceptual needs of users and customers rather than the data storage models and object models.

==Information data structures==
Information data structures are data structures specifically intended to support information inside a computer program. Two common ones are as follows:
* Data structures to support [[Fuzzy logic]].
* Data structures to support concept combinations&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gzb4-EqD76cC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=%22combinations+of+concepts%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZUUJhexYzo&amp;sig=qn-BN8YhOaU-y1-HpWgX6MONIfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtteuvqYDOAhXBOj4KHSuzBtUQ6AEIdTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=%22combinations%20of%20concepts%22&amp;f=false] An Ontological and Epistemological Perspective of Fuzzy Set Theory&lt;/ref&gt; and concept [[Permutations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wordpress.com/post/thisstack.wordpress.com/1449] Endemes are an Information Structure&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Chaney''' (born January 21, 1932) is an American retired college [[basketball]] coach, best known for his success at [[Temple University]].

==Early life and playing career==
Chaney was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. He began his career after graduating from [[Bethune–Cookman University|Bethune–Cookman College]] and spending some time in the [[Eastern Professional Basketball League]], first with the Sunbury Mercuries from 1955 to 1963 and Williamsport Billies from 1963 to 1966.&lt;ref name="Philly HOF"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Chaney first became a basketball coach in 1963 at [[Sayre Area School District|Sayre Junior High School]] and went 59–9 in three seasons.&lt;ref name="cares so much"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cherner|first1=Reid|title=Chaney a teacher first 'who cares so much'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/atlantic10/2004-01-13-chaney_x.htm |website=USA Today|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=January 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inheriting a one-win team in 1966 at [[Simon Gratz High School]] in Philadelphia, Chaney compiled a 63–23 record in six seasons.&lt;ref name="Philly HOF"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Chaney|url=http://www.phillyhall.org/inductee_profile.asp?ind=36|publisher=Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first collegiate position held by Chaney was at Division II [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania|Cheyney State]]. At Cheyney, Chaney was 232–56. He won a national title in 1978.&lt;ref name="Temple"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Chaney|url=http://www.owlsports.com/sports/mbball/coach/bio.asp?COACH_ID=1943|publisher=Temple University Athletics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428054702/http://www.owlsports.com/sports/mbball/coach/bio.asp?COACH_ID=1943|archivedate=April 28, 2006|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decade at Cheyney, Chaney moved on to Division I [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E2DE1F39F93BA2575BC0A964948260 |work=The New York Times |title=Chaney Is Named Coach at Temple |date=August 18, 1982 |accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaney built a reputation as a tough coach who always demanded excellence on and off the court. He was well known for his early-morning practices, [[match-up zone defense]], tough non-conference scheduling, and winning basketball teams.&lt;ref name="cares so much" /&gt;

Chaney won a total of 741 career games. He took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked #1 in the country, and he reached the Elite Eight on five different occasions.

In 2001, Chaney was elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].

On December 20, 2004, during a win over [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|Princeton]], Chaney became the fifth active coach and 19th all-time to appear on the sidelines for 1,000 games, joining [[Lou Henson]] ([[New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball|New Mexico State]], [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]]), [[Bob Knight]] ([[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army]], [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]], [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Texas Tech]]), [[Eddie Sutton]] ([[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]], [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State]], [[San Francisco Dons men's basketball|San Francisco]]), and [[Hugh Durham]] ([[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]], [[Georgia Bulldogs basketball|Georgia]], [[Jacksonville Dolphins men's basketball|Jacksonville]]).

On March 13, 2006, Chaney announced his retirement from coaching at a [[press conference]], to be effective after Temple's play in the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT). [[Fran Dunphy]] was named Chaney's successor following the season. Chaney has since been inducted into the [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big 5]] Hall of Fame, which recognizes the best in Philadelphia's college basketball history.

==Controversy==
On February 13, 1994, controversy ensued when he threatened to kill then-[[UMass Minutemen basketball|University of Massachusetts Amherst]] coach [[John Calipari]] at a post-game news conference, where Calipari was speaking at a podium. Chaney entered the conference mid-speech, accusing Calipari of manipulating the referees.  When Calipari attempted to respond to the accusations, Chaney yelled, "Shut up goddammit!", and proceeded to charge the stage, before being stopped by security.  While being held back, Chaney shouted, "When I see you, I'm gonna kick your ass!" As security restrained Chaney, he repeatedly yelled, "I'll kill you!" and angrily admitted telling his players to "knock your fucking kids in the mouth." Chaney received a one-game suspension for the incident. The two coaches later reconciled. Chaney has recently praised Calipari's coaching ability and defended him over the [[Derrick Rose]] controversy at the [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moran|first1=Malcolm|title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Chaney Lambastes UMass's Calipari |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/14/sports/college-basketball-chaney-lambastes-umass-s-calipari.html|accessdate=December 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=February 14, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Chaney to John Calipari: "I'll Kill You"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6jUpHClybQ|publisher=YouTube|date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaney made headlines in 2005 after ordering backup forward Nehemiah Ingram into the game to commit hard fouls against Big 5 rival [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|Saint Joseph]]'s in response to what he thought were several missed calls by the referees. After the game Chaney admitted to "sending a message" and stated "I'm going to send in what we used to do years ago, send in the goons."&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Madness of John Chaney|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/2007/07/05/the-madness-of-john-chaney/ |accessdate=December 30, 2017|work=Philadelphia Magazine|date=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bryant of Saint Joseph's suffered a fractured arm as a result of an intentional foul.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

Following the incident, he suspended himself for one game, and upon hearing the severity of the injury, the university suspended him for the remainder of the regular season.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt; Temple then later extended the suspension to the Atlantic 10 tournament. He returned for a farewell season that ended in a loss to Saint Joseph's in the A-10 Tournament.

Sweeney went to Dana Hall Schools in [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], MA, where she received her high school diploma in 1977. She delivered the valedictory at the graduation ceremony.

Sweeney did undergraduate studies at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]], where she focused on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

She went to [[Harvard Extension School]] to study Computer Science, where she received an ALB degree (Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies) in Computer Science, Cum Laude. Her undergraduate research thesis was called “A Coin Toss: the Dialectical Odds Aren't Always 50/50”. She received honors grades in all courses and completed graduate courses in computer science, mathematics, physics, educational psychology, and philosophy. She also delivered the graduation speech.

Sweeney returned to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to study for her master degree, where she received an S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1997. During her studying of master degree, she received a GPA of 4.9/5.0. Sweeney wrote a Master's thesis called “Sprees, a Finite-State Orthographic Learning System that Recognizes and Generates Phonologically Similar Spellings”, where she was the finalist in MasterWorks. She continued to study at MIT for her Ph.D. degree, where she advanced in Computer Science. She received the degree in 2001 and finished her Ph.D. thesis “Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice”.

== Career and Research ==
In 2001, Sweeney became director and founder of the [[Data Privacy Lab]], at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. She was a member of the Program Committee for Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI) in 2005. In 2004, she founded the Journal of Privacy Technology, later becoming the editor-in-chief in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latanyasweeney.org/bio.html|title=Biographical sketches of Latanya Sweeney, Ph.D.|website=latanyasweeney.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her PhD dissertation at [[MIT]] (Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice), Sweeney examines various computational methodologies for the secure dissemination of anonymous data without revealing any identifying, or potentially identifying, information. She proposes novel approaches for secure data disclosure, defining and describing null-map, k-map and wrong-map models of protection. Sweeney then critiques and compares four electronic data-based computational programs on their capacity to protect private information. The systems evaluated are her Scrub System, her Datafly II System, Statistics Netherlands’ u-Argus System, and her k-Similar algorithm – which she concludes as the most effective system in minimizing privacy risks. Prior to her dissertation, Sweeney has already been published numerous times, in topics pertaining to healthcare data security, and she has also completed a Masters Thesis at MIT and a ALB Thesis at Harvard. Currently, Sweeney is a prominent data security researcher and continues ongoing work to advance this field.

[https://techscience.org/a/2015103001/ Who Knows What About Me? A Survey of behind the Scenes Personal Data Sharing to Third Parties by Mobile Apps.]

By conducting research on 110 mobile apps over 9 categories (including business, games, fitness &amp; health etc.), Sweeney found that many mobile apps transmits sensitive personal data to third-party domains, particularly name, location and email etc. According to her study, [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps send potential sensitive personal data to 3.1 third-party domains. As for [[App Store (iOS)|iOS apps]], they connected with an average of 2.6 third party domains. While increasing bringing up awareness for current risks for privacy leakage, Sweeney also inspires us to think about possible future sharing permission system on mobile phones.

In 2016 L. Sweeny, M. Bar-Sinai, M. Crosas, introduced Data Tags, Data Handling Policy Spaces and the Tags Language in IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops 2016 in San Jose CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Latanya|last2=Bar-Sinai|first2=Michael|date=May 2016|title=Data Tags, Data Handling Policy Spaces and the Tags Language|url=|journal=IEEE 2016 Security and Privacy Workshops|volume=|pages=1–8|doi=10.1109/SPW.2016.11|via=IEEE Explore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper introduces the Tags programming language and toolset which through questionnaires suggests data handling policies appropriate to the level of security the dataset requires.  The Tags Language and Tools simplifies the development of security policies by recommending policies that meet the legal requirements for that dataset, like HIPAA.

=== Early Publication and Challenges ===
In 1997, Sweeney conducted her first re-identification experiment wherein she successfully identified then Massachusetts governor, William Weld to his medical records using publicly accessible records. Her results had a significant impact on privacy centered policymaking including the health privacy legislation HIPAA, however publication of the experiment was rejected twenty times. The several re-identification experiments she conducted after this were met with serious publication challenges as well. In fact, a court ruling in Southern Illinoisian v. Department of Public Health barred her from publication and sharing of her methods for a successful re-identification experiment. Fear of publicly exposing a serious issue with no known solution fueled majority of the backlash against publication of her works and similar re-identification experiments for over a decade. Unless experiments concluded that no risk existed or that the issue could be resolved through reasonable technological advancement, publication was largely denied.

In her article “[https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/ Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know],” writer Latanya Sweeney discusses her research project in which she located and matched up identities and personal health records through a number of methods. Such methods, as she explains in depth later on, include looking at public health records from hospitals and newspaper stories. Towards the end of the article, Sweeney touches upon the different approaches of how she analyzed and matched the data, either through using computer programs or human effort. She then makes the conclusion that new and improved methods of data sharing are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Latanya|date=2015-09-29|title=Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know|url=https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/|journal=Technology Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab has been conducting research about data privacy at Harvard. It intends to provide a cross-disciplinary perspective about privacy in the process of disseminating data. The Data Privacy Lab is sponsored by government, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. It is also in partnership with Berkman Klein Center, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Program on Informational Sciences. One of her missions of the Data Privacy Lab includes creating a conversation about data in technology and policies on protecting personal data in technology.  Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab is working on 102 different projects regarding data privacy. Some of which include: The Genomic Privacy Project, Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery Project, Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project, and the Identifiability Project. The Genomic Privacy Project attempts to question the privacy of our genetic code and the use of genetic code to identify individuals. The Discrimination in Online Delivery Project examines the possibility of discrimination in the type of ads that show up in a search on a particular individual. There is a possibility that some searches will yield ads that are discriminatory to racial minorities. The Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project attempts to create algorithms in computer coding that will automatically protect privacy in the process of linking—which is the chain of searches that can be traced. The Identifiability Project examines how individuals can be identified through the use public census data. She argues that individuals can be identified using population census data through the combination of zip code, gender, and date of birth.

In [[physics]] (particularly in [[electromagnetism]]) the '''Lorentz force''' (or '''electromagnetic force''') is the combination of electric and magnetic [[force]] on a [[point charge]] due to [[electromagnetic field]]s. A particle of charge ''q'' moving with a velocity ''v'' in an [[electric field]] '''E''' and a [[magnetic field]] '''B''' experiences a force
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E} + q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
(in [[International System of Units|SI units]]&lt;ref name=units&gt;In SI units, {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (symbol: T). In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-cgs units]], {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (symbol: G). See e.g. {{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=units2&gt;The {{math|'''H'''}}-field is measured in [[ampere]]s per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in [[oersted]]s (Oe) in cgs units. {{cite web|title=International system of units (SI) |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |work=NIST reference on constants, units, and uncertainty |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]]), the [[electromotive force]] in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of [[Faraday's law of induction]]), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near the [[speed of light]] ([[special relativity|relativistic]] form of the Lorentz force).

The first derivation of the Lorentz force is commonly attributed to [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1889,&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt; although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=Huray/&gt; [[Hendrik Lorentz]] derived it in 1895,&lt;ref name=Dahl/&gt; a few years after Heaviside.

==Equation==

===Charged particle===

[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of charge ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v'''). The [[electric field|'''E''' field]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' field]] vary in space and time.]]

The force '''F''' acting on a particle of [[electric charge]] ''q'' with instantaneous velocity '''v''', due to an external electric field '''E''' and magnetic field '''B''', is given by (in [[SI units]]&lt;ref name=units/&gt;):&lt;ref name=Jackson2/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; is the vector cross product (all boldface quantities are vectors). In terms of cartesian components, we have:

&lt;math&gt;F_x = q (E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_y = q (E_y + v_z B_x - v_x B_z),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_z = q (E_z + v_x B_y - v_y B_x).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the electric and magnetic fields are functions of the position and time. Therefore, explicitly, the Lorentz force can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\dot{r}},t,q) = q[\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) + \mathbf{\dot{r}} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t)]&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''r''' is the position vector of the charged particle, ''t'' is time, and the overdot is a time derivative.

A positively charged particle will be accelerated in the ''same'' linear orientation as the '''E''' field, but will curve perpendicularly to both the instantaneous velocity vector '''v''' and the '''B''' field according to the [[right-hand rule]] (in detail, if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of '''v''' and are then curled to point in the direction of '''B''', then the extended thumb will point in the direction of '''F''').

The term ''q'''''E''' is called the '''electric force''', while the term ''q'''''v''' &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; '''B''' is called the '''magnetic force'''.&lt;ref name=Griffiths1&gt;See Griffiths, page 204.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some definitions, the term "Lorentz force" refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force,&lt;ref name=Griffiths2&gt;For example, see the [http://ilorentz.org/history/lorentz/lorentz.html website of the Lorentz Institute] or Griffiths.&lt;/ref&gt; with the ''total'' electromagnetic force (including the electric force) given some other (nonstandard) name. This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term "Lorentz force" will refer to the expression for the total force.

The magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].

The Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F} = q \, \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.

===Continuous charge distribution===

[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] ρ) in motion. The 3-[[current density]] '''J''' corresponds to the motion of the charge element ''dq'' in [[volume element]] ''dV'' and varies throughout the continuum.]]

For a continuous [[charge distribution]] in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{F} = \mathrm{d}q\left(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'''''F''' is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge ''dq''. If both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution ''dV'', the result is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \rho\left(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''f''' is the ''force density'' (force per unit volume) and ''ρ'' is the [[charge density]] (charge per unit volume). Next, the [[current density]] corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so the continuous analogue to the equation is&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-13-805326-0|edition=3rd |others= reprint. with corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \rho \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

The total force is the [[volume integral]] over the charge distribution:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \iiint \! ( \rho \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} )\,\mathrm{d}V. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By eliminating ρ and '''J''', using [[Maxwell's equations]], and manipulating using the theorems of [[vector calculus]], this form of the equation can be used to derive the [[Maxwell stress tensor]] '''σ''', in turn this can be combined with the [[Poynting vector]] '''S''' to obtain the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] '''T''' used in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"/&gt;

In terms of '''σ''' and '''S''', another way to write the Lorentz force (per unit volume) is&lt;ref name="Electrodynamics 1999"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} = \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma} - \dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial t}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and [[Nabla symbol|∇]]· denotes the divergence of a [[tensor field]]. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the [[energy flux]] (flow of ''energy'' per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism#Charge continuum|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]] for more details.

The density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = (\rho_f - \nabla \cdot \mathbf P) \mathbf{E} + (\mathbf{J}_f + \nabla\times\mathbf{M} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{P}}{\partial t}) \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

where: &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of free charge; ''P'' is the [[polarization density]]; ''J''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of free current; and ''M'' is the [[magnetization]] density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{J}_f + \nabla\times\mathbf{M} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{P}}{\partial t}\right) \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equation in cgs units===
The above-mentioned formulae use [[SI units]] which are the most common among experimentalists, technicians, and engineers. In [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]], which are somewhat more common among theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q_\mathrm{cgs} \left(\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{cgs} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}_\mathrm{cgs}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. 
Although this equation looks slightly different, it is completely equivalent, since
one has the following relations:&lt;ref name=units/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q_\mathrm{cgs}=\frac{q_\mathrm{SI}}{\sqrt{4\pi \epsilon_0}},\quad \mathbf E_\mathrm{cgs} =\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\mathbf E_\mathrm{SI},\quad \mathbf B_\mathrm{cgs} ={\sqrt{4\pi /\mu_0}}\,{\mathbf B_\mathrm{SI}},\quad c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \epsilon_0\mu_0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]] and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the [[vacuum permeability]]. In practice, the subscripts "cgs" and "SI" are always omitted, and the unit system has to be assessed from context.

Early attempts to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force were made in the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and others in 1760,&lt;ref&gt;

The modern concept of electric and magnetic fields first arose in the theories of [[Michael Faraday]], particularly his idea of [[lines of force]], later to be given full mathematical description by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[J. J. Thomson]] was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object's properties and external fields. Interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in [[cathode ray]]s, Thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as&lt;ref name=Nahin&gt;Paul J. Nahin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9wEntQmA0IC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Oliver Heaviside''], JHU Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{q}{2}\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thomson derived the correct basic form of the formula, but, because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the [[displacement current]], included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula.  [[Oliver Heaviside]] invented the modern vector notation and applied it to Maxwell's field equations; he also (in 1885 and 1889) had fixed the mistakes of Thomson's derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object.&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Lorentz began by abandoning the Maxwellian descriptions of the ether and conduction. Instead, Lorentz made a distinction between matter and the [[luminiferous aether]] and sought to apply the Maxwell equations at a microscopic scale. Using Heaviside's version of the Maxwell equations for a stationary ether and applying [[Lagrangian mechanics]] (see below), Lorentz arrived at the correct and complete form of the force law that now bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;

==Trajectories of particles due to the Lorentz force==
{{Main|Guiding center}}
[[File:charged-particle-drifts.svg|300px|thumbnail|right|'''Charged particle drifts''' in a homogeneous magnetic field. (A) No disturbing force (B) With an electric field, E (C) With an independent force, F (e.g. gravity) (D) In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, grad H]]
In many cases of practical interest, the motion in a [[magnetic field]] of an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particle (such as an [[electron]] or [[ion]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) can be treated as the [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the '''guiding center''' and a relatively slow '''drift''' of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.

==Significance of the Lorentz force==

While the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Jackson2&gt;See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, "Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths50&gt;See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, "together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics".&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.

In real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] or the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green–Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].

==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==

In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;ref name=Jackson20&gt;See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=72–73|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}. These authors use the Lorentz force in tensor form as definer of the [[electromagnetic tensor]] ''F'', in turn the fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author1=I.S. Grant |author2=W.R. Phillips |author3=Manchester Physics |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|page=122|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement:

:''The electromagnetic force '''F''' on a [[test charge]] at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge ''q'' and velocity '''v''', which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors '''E''' and '''B''', in the functional form'':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

This is valid, even for particles approaching the speed of light (that is, [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|magnitude]] of '''v''' = |'''v'''| ≈ ''c'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism (2nd Edition)|author1=I.S. Grant |author2=W.R. Phillips |author3=Manchester Physics |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|page=123|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the two [[vector field]]s '''E''' and '''B''' are thereby defined throughout space and time, and these are called the "electric field" and "magnetic field". The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.

As a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical "test charge" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham–Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.

==Force on a current-carrying wire==
[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]
When a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''ℓ''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] flow ''I''.

If the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''ℓ''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I\int \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell}\times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.

One application of this is [[Ampère's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Ampère's force law]].

==EMF==

The magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' × '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term "motional EMF" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.

In other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).&lt;ref name=Griffiths302&gt;See Griffiths, pages 301–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and Faraday.27s law of induction|below]].) Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.&lt;ref name=Griffiths302/&gt; In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the [[solenoidal vector field]] portion of the ''E''-field can change in whole or in part to a ''B''-field or ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;

==Lorentz force and Faraday's law of induction==

{{main|Faraday's law of induction}}

Given a loop of wire in a [[magnetic field]], Faraday's law of induction states the induced [[electromotive force]] (EMF) in the wire is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_B}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_B = \iint_{\Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[magnetic flux]] through the loop, '''B''' is the magnetic field, Σ(''t'') is a surface bounded by the closed contour ∂Σ(''t''), at all at time ''t'', d'''A''' is an infinitesimal [[vector area]] element of Σ(''t'') (magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface, direction is [[orthogonal]] to that surface patch).

The ''sign'' of the EMF is determined by [[Lenz's law]]. Note that this is valid for not only a ''stationary'' wire{{snd}}but also for a ''moving'' wire.

From [[Faraday's law of induction]] (that is valid for a moving wire, for instance in a motor) and the [[Maxwell Equations]], the Lorentz Force can be deduced. The reverse is also true, the Lorentz force and the [[Maxwell Equations]] can be used to derive the [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday Law]].

Let Σ(''t'') be the moving wire, moving together without rotation and with constant velocity '''v''' and Σ(''t'') be the internal surface of the wire. The EMF around the closed path ∂Σ(''t'') is given by:&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\oint_{\partial \Sigma (t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F} / q&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{F} / q&lt;/math&gt;

is the electric field and d'''ℓ''' is an [[infinitesimal]] vector element of the contour ∂Σ(''t'').

NB: Both d'''ℓ''' and d'''A''' have a sign ambiguity; to get the correct sign, the [[right-hand rule]] is used, as explained in the article [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

The above result can be compared with the version of Faraday's law of induction that appears in the modern Maxwell's equations, called here the ''Maxwell–Faraday equation'':

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Faraday equation also can be written in an ''integral form'' using the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].&lt;ref name=Harrington&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

So we have, the Maxwell Faraday equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t) = - \  \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf {A} \cdot {{\mathrm{d} \,\mathbf {B}(\mathbf{r},\ t)} \over \mathrm{d}t } &lt;/math&gt;

and the Faraday Law,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r},\ t) = - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf {A} \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t). &lt;/math&gt;

The two are equivalent if the wire is not moving. Using the [[Leibniz integral rule]] and that ''div'' '''B''' = 0, results in,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r}, t) = 
- \iint_{\Sigma(t)}  \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) +
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \!\!\!\!\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \,\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}
&lt;/math&gt;

and using the Maxwell Faraday equation,

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{F}/q(\mathbf{r},\ t) = 
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)} \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t)  +
\oint_{\partial \Sigma(t)}\!\!\!\! \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t)\, \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}
&lt;/math&gt;

since this is valid for any wire position it implies that,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}= q\,\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},\ t)  + q\,\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},\ t).&lt;/math&gt;

Faraday's law of induction holds whether the loop of wire is rigid and stationary, or in motion or in process of deformation, and it holds whether the magnetic field is constant in time or changing. However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].

If the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the '''B'''-field, the {{nowrap|'''B''' &amp;sdot; d'''A'''}} differential element will change because of the different angle between '''B''' and d'''A''', also changing Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent '''B'''-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface ∂Σ(''t'') time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field '''E''' is non conservative when the Magnetic Field '''B''' varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a [[scalar field]], and not subject to the [[gradient theorem]] since its rotational is not zero.&lt;ref name="Landau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Lorentz force in terms of potentials==

{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|Maxwell's equations|Helmholtz decomposition}}

The '''E''' and '''B''' fields can be replaced by the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and ([[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]) [[electrostatic potential]] ''ϕ''  by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi - \frac { \partial \mathbf{A} } { \partial t }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇ is the gradient, ∇⋅ is the divergence, ∇× is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].

The force becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla \phi- \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and using an [[Triple product#Vector triple product|identity for the triple product]] simplifies to

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla \phi- \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+ \nabla (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{A})-(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

('''v''' has no dependence on position, so there's no need to use [[Vector calculus identities#Special notations|Feynman's subscript notation]]). Using the chain rule, the [[total derivative]] of '''A''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

so the above expression can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla (\phi-\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{A})- \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

With '''v''' = '''ẋ''', we can put the equation into the convenient Euler–Lagrange form

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}(\phi-\dot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot\mathbf{A})+ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}(\phi-\dot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot\mathbf{A})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot{\mathbf{x}}} = \hat{x} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{x}} + \hat{y} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{y}} + \hat{z} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \dot{z}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for a charged particle of mass ''m'' and charge ''q'' in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its ''energy'', rather than the force exerted on it. The classical expression is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics (2nd Edition), T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}+q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}-q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where '''A''' and ''ϕ'' are the potential fields as above. Using [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], the equation for the Lorentz force can be obtained.

|-
|For an '''A''' field, a particle moving with velocity '''v''' = '''ṙ''' has [[potential momentum]] &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, so its potential energy is &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. For a ''ϕ'' field, the particle's potential energy is &lt;math&gt;q\phi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The total [[potential energy]] is then:

:&lt;math&gt;V=q\phi-q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[kinetic energy]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

hence the Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V=\frac{m}{2}\mathbf{\dot{r}}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}+q\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{r}}-q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}(\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2) + q(\dot{x}A_x+\dot{y}A_y+\dot{z}A_z) - q\phi&lt;/math&gt;

Lagrange's equations are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

(same for ''y'' and ''z''). So calculating the partial derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} &amp; =m\ddot{x}+q\frac{\mathrm{d} A_x}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
&amp; = m\ddot{x}+ \frac{q}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}dt+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}dz\right) \\
&amp; = m\ddot{x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\dot{z}\right)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}= -q\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}\dot{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

equating and simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\dot{z}\right)= -q\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+ q\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\dot{x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x}\dot{y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}\dot{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} F_x &amp; = -q\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}\right) + q\left[\dot{y}\left(\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\right)+\dot{z}\left(\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}\right)\right] \\
&amp; = qE_x + q[\dot{y}(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})_z-\dot{z}(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})_y] \\
&amp; = qE_x + q[\mathbf{\dot{r}}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})]_x \\
&amp; = qE_x + q(\mathbf{\dot{r}}\times\mathbf{B})_x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' directions. Hence the force equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{\dot{r}}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The potential energy depends on the velocity of the particle, so the force is velocity dependent, so it is not conservative.

The relativistic Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L = -mc^2\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2} + q \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\dot{\mathbf{r}} - q \phi(\mathbf{r}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The action is the relativistic [[arclength]] of the path of the particle in [[space time]], minus the potential energy contribution, plus an extra contribution which [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanically]] is an extra [[phase (waves)|phase]] a charged particle gets when it is moving along a vector potential.

The equations of motion derived by [[calculus of variations|extremizing]] the action (see [[matrix calculus]] for the notation):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{P}}{\mathrm{d}t} =\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{r}} = q {\partial \mathbf{A} \over \partial \mathbf{r}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}} - q {\partial \phi \over \partial \mathbf{r} }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} -q\mathbf{A} = \frac{m\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

are the same as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}}\left ( \sqrt{(\mathbf{P}-q\mathbf{A})^2 +(mc^2)^2} + q\phi \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -{\partial \over \partial \mathbf{r}}\left ( \sqrt{(\mathbf{P}-q\mathbf{A})^2 + (mc^2)^2} + q\phi \right ) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

both are equivalent to the noncanonical form:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left ( {m\dot{\mathbf{r}} \over \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{r}}}{c}\right)^2}} \right ) = q\left ( \mathbf{E} + \dot\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{B} \right ) . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is the Lorentz force, representing the rate at which the EM field adds relativistic momentum to the particle.

==Relativistic form of the Lorentz force==

===Covariant form of the Lorentz force===

====Field tensor====

{{main|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}

Using the [[metric signature]] {{nowrap|(1, −1, −1, −1)}}, the Lorentz force for a charge ''q'' can be written in&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.D. Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorentz covariance|covariant form]]:

{{Equation box 1

|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where ''p&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[four-momentum]], defined as

:&lt;math&gt;p^\alpha = \left(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3 \right) = \left(\gamma m c, p_x, p_y, p_z \right) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

''τ'' the [[proper time]] of the particle, ''F&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt;'' the contravariant [[electromagnetic tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha \beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -E_x/c &amp; -E_y/c &amp; -E_z/c \\
E_x/c &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
E_y/c &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
E_z/c &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''U'' is the covariant [[four-velocity|4-velocity]] of the particle, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\beta = \left(U_0, U_1, U_2, U_3 \right) = \gamma \left(c, -v_x, -v_y, -v_z \right) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v_x^2 + v_y^2+ v_z^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]].

The fields are transformed to a frame moving with constant relative velocity by:

:&lt;math&gt; F'^{\mu \nu} = {\Lambda^{\mu}}_{\alpha} {\Lambda^{\nu}}_{\beta} F^{\alpha \beta} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where Λ''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Lorentz transformation]] tensor.

====Translation to vector notation====

The {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 1}} component (''x''-component) of the force is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q U_\beta F^{1 \beta} = q\left(U_0 F^{10} + U_1 F^{11} + U_2 F^{12} + U_3 F^{13} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the components of the covariant electromagnetic tensor ''F'' yields

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q \left[U_0 \left(\frac{E_x}{c} \right) + U_2 (-B_z) + U_3 (B_y) \right] .&lt;/math&gt;

Using the components of covariant [[four-velocity]] yields

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 \frac{\mathrm{d} p^1}{\mathrm{d} \tau} &amp; = q \gamma \left[c \left(\frac{E_x}{c} \right) + (-v_y) (-B_z) + (-v_z) (B_y) \right] \\
 &amp;= q \gamma \left(E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y \right) \\
 &amp; = q \gamma \left[ E_x + \left( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right)_x \right] \, .
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The calculation for {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 2}}, 3 (force components in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions) yields similar results, so collecting the 3 equations into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{p} }{\mathrm{d} \tau} = q \gamma\left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

and since differentials in coordinate time ''dt'' and proper time ''dτ'' are related by the Lorentz factor,

:&lt;math&gt;dt=\gamma(v)d\tau\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{p} }{\mathrm{d} t} = q \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is precisely the Lorentz force law, however, it is important to note that '''p''' is the relativistic expression,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\gamma(v) m_0 \mathbf{v} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentz force in spacetime algebra (STA)===

The electric and magnetic fields are [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity|dependent on the velocity of an observer]], so the relativistic form of the Lorentz force law can best be exhibited starting from a coordinate-independent expression for the electromagnetic and magnetic fields  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and an arbitrary time-direction, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be settled through [[Spacetime algebra|Space-Time Algebra]] (or the geometric algebra of space-time), a type of Clifford's Algebra defined on a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hestenes|first=David|authorlink=David Hestenes|title=SpaceTime Calculus|url=http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/STC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = (\mathcal{F}\cdot\gamma_0)\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;i\mathbf{B} = (\mathcal{F}\wedge\gamma_0)\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; is a space-time bivector (an oriented plane segment, just like a vector is an oriented line segment), which has six degrees of freedom corresponding to boosts (rotations in space-time planes) and rotations (rotations in space-space planes).  The dot product with the vector &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; pulls a vector (in the space algebra) from the translational part, while the wedge-product creates a trivector (in the space algebra) who is dual to a vector which is the usual magnetic field vector.
The relativistic velocity is given by the (time-like) changes in a time-position vector &lt;math&gt;v=\dot x&lt;/math&gt;, where

: &lt;math&gt;v^2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

(which shows our choice for the metric) and the velocity is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = cv \wedge \gamma_0 / (v \cdot \gamma_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The proper (invariant is an inadequate term because no transformation has been defined) form of the Lorentz force law is simply

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; F = q\mathcal{F}\cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

Note that the order is important because between a bivector and a vector the dot product is anti-symmetric. Upon a space time split like one can obtain the velocity, and fields as above yielding the usual expression.

===Lorentz force in general relativity===
In the [[general theory of relativity]] the equation of motion for a particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, moving in a space with metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;F_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, is given as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\frac{1}{2}g_{ab,c}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u^a= dx^a/ds&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;dx^a&lt;/math&gt; is taken along the trajectory), &lt;math&gt;g_{ab,c}= \partial g_{ab}/\partial x^c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;ds^2=g_{ab}dx^adx^b&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\Gamma_{abc}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{abc}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita connection#Christoffel symbols|Christoffel symbol]] (of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity), or as
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{Du_c}{ds}=eF_{cb}u^b \;,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[covariant differential]] in general relativity (metric, torsion-free).

In algebraic geometry, the '''moduli stack of formal group laws''' is a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] classifying [[formal group]] laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a "geometric “object" that underlies the [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic]] approach to the [[stable homotopy theory]], a branch of algebraic topology.

Currently, it is not known whether &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[derived stack]] or not. Hence, it is typical to work with stratifications. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; be given so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal group laws over ''R'' of height exactly ''n''. They form a stratification of the moduli stack  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} \to \mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]]. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} / \operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[profinite group]] called the '''Morava stabilizer group'''. The [[Lubin–Tate theory]] describes how the strata &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; fit together.
&lt;!--This moduli stack is closely related to the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]].{{vague}}

In characteristic zero, this moduli stack is very easy to understand: the quotient stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}} \times_{\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;B \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt;, the [[classifying stack]] of line bundles. This can be thought of as a manifestation of the "thesis" of [[differential graded Lie algebra]]s.

In 1990, Seles became the youngest ever [[1990 French Open|French Open]] champion at the age of 16. She went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday and was the year-end world no. 1 in 1991 and 1992. However, on April 30, 1993, she was the victim of an on-court attack, when a man stabbed her in the back with a {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}} long knife. Seles did not return to tennis for over two years.&lt;ref name="stabbed"/&gt; Though she enjoyed some success after rejoining the tour in 1995, including a fourth [[1996 Australian Open|Australian Open title in 1996]], she was unable to consistently reproduce her best form. She played her last professional match at the [[2003 French Open]], but did not officially retire until February 2008.

Regarded by many in the sport as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future – Monica Seles|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2079150_2079148_2079130,00.html|publisher=''TIME''|accessdate=August 19, 2011|author=William Lee Adams|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several players and historians have stated that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/05/monica-seles-interview |title=Interview: Monica Seles |first=Tim |last=Adams |work=theguardian.com |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espnw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/04/20-years-later-remembering-monica-seless-stabbing/47277/ |title=20 Years Later: Remembering Monica Seles' Stabbing |first=Jonathan |last=Scott |work=Tennis.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

==Early life and career==
Seles was born in Yugoslavia into an [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|ethnic Hungarian]] family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/7354|title=Players|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has an older brother, Zoltán. She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional [[cartoonist]] employed for decades at the ''[[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Magyar Szó]]'' newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/03/najbolja-jugoslovenska-teniserka-monika.html Najbolja jugoslovenska teniserka Monika Seleš (1.deo) – Naša Mala Mo!];''Studio'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand.&lt;ref&gt;Seles, Monica with Nancy Ann Richardson (1996) Monica From Fear to Victory&lt;/ref&gt; Later, her coach was [[Jelena Genčić]]. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the [[Junior Orange Bowl]] tournament in [[Miami]], Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach [[Nick Bollettieri]]. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zoltán moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the Academy, Seles' mother and father joined her and Zoltán in Florida.

Seles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire [[Chris Evert]] in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Steffi Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6.

==Tennis career==

===1990–92===
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--only one citation in section--&gt;
After a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title at the [[1990 French Open]]. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by [[Zina Garrison]] at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9–7 in the 3rd set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], defeating [[Gabriela Sabatini]] in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships. She finished the year ranked world no. 2.

1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women's tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating [[Jana Novotná]] in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], in the final. Unable to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], suffering from [[shin splints]], Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], which she won by beating [[Martina Navratilova]] in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world.

1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first-ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent [[Nathalie Tauziat]] was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against [[Martina Navratilova]], Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4–2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-03/sports/sp-1393_1_monica-seles |title=WIMBLEDON : Seles Quiets Navratilov |first=Thomas |last=Bonk |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1992-07-03 |access-date=2018-04-28 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159–12 win-loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55–1 win-loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989–1992), Seles had a win-loss record of 231–25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world.

===1993 stabbing attack===
Seles was the top ranked women's player heading into 1993, having won the [[French Open]] for three consecutive years and both the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Australian Open]] in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which to date was her third win in four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany.

On April 30 during a quarterfinal match with [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in [[WTA Hamburg|Hamburg]] in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a [[boning knife]] between her shoulder blades, to a depth of 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.59&amp;nbsp;inches). She was quickly taken to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the [[Yugoslav Wars|ongoing conflict there]]. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.&lt;ref name=stabbed&gt;{{cite news|title=1993: Tennis star stabbed |work=On This Day 30&amp;nbsp;April 1993 |publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/30/newsid_2499000/2499161.stm |date=1993-04-30 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parche was charged following the incident, but was not jailed because he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tour events.&lt;ref name=stabbed /&gt; At that year's [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the players’ seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying "From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =O'Sullivan | first =John | title =Seles still has issues with security | work=The Irish Times | date =2011-04-09 | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0409/1224294297903.html | accessdate =2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the [[German legal system]]. "What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wood |title=WTA Under Fire from Seles |date=November 16, 2000 |publisher=BBC |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/1025898.stm |work=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, ''Tennis.com'' reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Graf visited Seles while she was hospitalized.&lt;ref name=articletwo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=Tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young Elders]], a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called "Fly Monica Fly" to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1996|title=Monica: From Fear to Victory| first1= Monica | last1= Seles| first2= Nancy Ann | last2= Richardson

The WTA suggested that Seles' [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|No. 1 ranking]] be preserved during her absence, but did not do so.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=8 July 2015 |publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=78|title=Comeback: Back stabbers |date=31 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Seles' autobiography, all active tour players opposed the idea except [[Gabriela Sabatini]], who abstained.&lt;ref name="it61008"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/seles-is-back-in-the-limelight-1.61008|title=Seles is back in the limelight|date=26 June 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canchallena"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170730063335/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |archivedate= 30 July 2017|url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |language=Spanish |title=Gaby Sabatini.

===Comeback===
Seles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president [[Martina Navratilova]] proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] and [[Gigi Fernández]], whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/sports/tennis-it-s-not-easy-being-the-third-wheel.html | title=NY Times: It's not easy being a third wheel | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; Seles won her first comeback tournament, the [[1995 Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]], beating [[Amanda Coetzer]] in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).

The following month at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 [[Anke Huber]], No. 4 Jana Novotná, and No. 3 Conchita Martínez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final.

In January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5–3 in the final set, and had 2 break points to lead 5–1. Seles came back from 2 points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles' last [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Steffi Graf again in 1996. Seles' last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 [[Jana Novotná]] in three sets and world no. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] in straight sets, but lost to Sánchez Vicario in the three-set final.

While she did not reach another [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour's top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated [[Venus Williams]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Jennifer Capriati]], [[Justine Henin]], [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Kim Clijsters]], and [[Lindsay Davenport]], and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament.

Seles competed at the [[Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|1996 Olympic Games]] in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotná in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated [[Jelena Dokic]] in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough 3 setter in the semis, losing 6–3 in the final set.

After becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles helped the U.S. team win the [[Fed Cup]] in 1996, 1999, and 2000.

===Hiatus and retirement===
[[File:Monica Seles.jpg|thumb|160px|Seles in the 2007 exhibition against [[Martina Navratilova]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]]]
In the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against [[Nadia Petrova]] at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]]. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the [[2003 French Open]]. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/PlayerActivity.asp?PlayerID=190141 Monica Seles playing activity] [[WTA Tour]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas, on [[clay court|clay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 Seles Sighting: Monica plays Martina in exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209034256/http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstennisblog.com/2007/09/17/monica-seles-defeats-martina-navratilova-in-exhibition-match-in-bucharest |title=Monica Seles defeats Martina Navratilova in exhibition match in Bucharest |publisher=Womenstennisblog.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Seles told the press that [[Lindsay Davenport]]'s successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2045 |title=Seles Announces Retirement From Professional Tennis |publisher=Sonyericssonwtatour.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Seles was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/sports/tennis/16tennis.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Seles Is Elected to Hall of Fame | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
[[File:Seles outfit and racket.jpg|thumb|200px|Seles' outfit at the [[Tennis Hall of Fame]] Museum at the [[Newport Casino]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]]]]
Seles is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/top-10-womens-tennis-players-all-time-where-does-serena-williams-rank-list-greatest-2073830|title=Top 10 Women’s Tennis Players Of All-Time: Where Does Serena Williams Rank On List Of Greatest Ever?|publisher=International Business Times|author1=Jason Le Miere|date=28 August 2015|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/38769292|title=Serena Williams: Is she your greatest female player of the Open era?|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 January 2017|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/16371992/tennis-top-20-all|title=Tennis' Top 20 of All Time|publisher=ESPN|author1=Greg Garber|author2=Thomas Neumann|author3=Johnette Howard|date=23 June 2016|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Tennis Channel created a list of the [[100 Greatest of All Time|100 greatest]] tennis players. Seles was listed at #19.

Seles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of ''Tennis.com'' stated, "Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know."&lt;ref name=article/&gt; In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, "We'd be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] [[Margaret Court]] or Steffi Graf."&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked.&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Tim Adams of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Seles would have become "the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

During the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era.

Until her loss to [[Martina Hingis]] at the [[1999 Australian Open]], Seles had a perfect record at the event (33–0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the [[Medibank International|Sydney tournament]] in 1996. Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals: [[1990 French Open]], [[1991 Australian Open]], [[1991 French Open]], [[1991 US Open (tennis)|1991 US Open]], [[1992 Australian Open]], and [[1992 French Open]]. Seles was also the first female player since [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] in 1937 to win the women's singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by [[Justine Henin]] in 2005-7. (Also, [[Chris Evert]] won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980).

Shortly after her retirement, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jon Wertheim]] summed up her later career:
{{quote|Yet, transformed from champion to tragedienne, Seles became far more popular than she was while winning all those titles. It became impossible to root against her. At first, out of sympathy. Then, because she revealed herself to be so thoroughly thoughtful, graceful, dignified. When she quietly announced her retirement last week at age 34, she exited as perhaps the most adored figure in the sport's history. As happy endings go, one could do worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/jon_wertheim/02/20/mailbag/index.html |title=Tennis Mailbag: Saluting Seles |first=Jon |last=Wertheim |work=SportsIllustrated.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

==Equipment and endorsements==
In the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with [[Fila (company)|Fila]] to promote its footwear and tennis apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-26/business/fi-640_1_tennis-star |title=Athletic Firms Going to the Net in Quest for Next Tennis Celebrity |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=June 26, 1990 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She used a [[Prince original graphite]] racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/finding-the-spin/story-fnay3ubk-1226410204866?nk=ff5b5e1a7e3b23eca0390c14fd756c7e |title=Finding the spin may be a racquet |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=June 30, 2012 |first=Tom |last= Perrotta |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet.

When she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing sabbatical, Seles wore apparel by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and used a Yonex racquet on court.

In the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used [[Yonex]] SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2000/08/20000828/No-Topic-Name/WHAT-THEYRE-WEARING-AND-HITTING-WITH-AT-THE-US-OPEN.aspx |title=WHAT THEY'RE WEARING (AND HITTING WITH) AT THE U.S. OPEN |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |date=28 August 2000 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On April 21, 2009, Seles released her [[memoir]] ''Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self'' which chronicles her bout with depression and [[binge eating disorder]] (BED) after her stabbing, her father's [[cancer]] diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game and a life beyond tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103289593|title=Monica Seles On 'Getting A Grip' After Tragedy|newspaper=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to treat BED, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/03/08/monica-seles-gabriela-sabatini-exhibition-new-york/24609499/|title=Monica Seles sheds light on binge eating disorder|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|author=Casey, Tim|language=en| date=Mar 11, 2015|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16885">'''Motivational intensity''' is defined as the strength of the tendency to either approach a positive situation or event or to move away from a negative situation or event.&lt;ref name="HJ2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Price | first3 = T. F. | year = 2013 | title = Does negative affect always narrow and positive affect always broaden the mind? Considering the influence of motivational intensity on cognitive scope | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 301–307 | doi = 10.1177/0963721413481353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see the motivational intensity and cognitive scope subheading under [[Affect (psychology)]].

== Separation of Motivational Intensity and Valence ==

In psychology, the term ''valence'' is used to describe stimuli, events, situations and emotional states that are intrinsically attractive (positively valenced) or intrinsically aversive (negatively valenced). The valence of a stimulus or event tells us whether we are likely to approach or avoid it. Valence, however provides no information about the strength of this tendency as it is either positive or negative. Instead, the strength of this association is quantified as the Motivational Intensity. By analogy, the valence of a stimulus or event is like the sign of a correlation coefficient and its motivational intensity is like the coefficient magnitude.

It has been suggested that valence ratings in normative data sets such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) might be used as proxies for motivational intensity.&lt;ref name=HJ2013/&gt; However, valence and motivational intensity do not always go hand in hand with one another. For example, viewing a positively valenced picture of a cute cat is associated with low motivational intensity because participants like it but are not intrinsically driven towards it. In contrast, viewing a positively valenced picture of a dessert is associated with high motivational intensity because participants want and desire it.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008a | title = Approach-motivated positive affect reduces breadth of attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 476–482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02112.x | pmid=18466409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valence and motivational intensity can be at odds with one another with negatively valenced stimuli as well.&lt;ref name="HJ2013"/&gt;

== Separation of Motivational Intensity and Arousal ==

Motivational intensity and arousal are related, but are considered to be separate ideas; arousal has implications for action, but motivational intensity does not and it is possible to experience high levels of arousal, but not experience motivational intensity (e.g., laughing).&lt;ref name="GHJ2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Does arousal per se account for the influence of appetitive stimuli on attentional scope and the late positive potential? | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 344–350 | doi = 10.1111/psyp.12023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants’ to view pictures and then complete an attention task. Half of the participants pedaled on a stationary bicycle (to induce high arousal), while others did not. Results demonstrated that there was no difference in performance on the attention task with high or low levels of arousal, but pictures high in motivational intensity narrowed attention, compared to pictures that were low in motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="GHJ2013" /&gt;

== Motivational Intensity, Valence and Attention ==

According to motivational intensity theory, high approach motivational intensity will narrow attention and conversely, low motivational intensity will broaden attention.&lt;ref name="HJ2013" /&gt; This theory is at odds with a more traditional explanation of the effects of affect on cognitive scope, which suggest that positive affect broadens attention and negative affect narrows attention, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | year = 2001 | title = The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 218–226 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.56.3.218 | pmid=11315248 | pmc=3122271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement and Manipulation of Motivational Intensity ===

Motivational intensity has been experimentally measured and manipulated in a variety of contexts as highlighted below.

==== Film Clips ====

Gable and Harmon-Jones examined the effects of high and low motivational intensity on the scope of attention. Motivational intensity was manipulated using film clips. Half of the participants watched a film showing cats to induce low motivational intensity. Half of participants watched a film showing appetizing desserts to induce high motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Approach-motivated positive affect reduces breadth of attention | url = | journal = Psychol. Sci. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 476–482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02112.x | pmid=18466409}}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the film, participants completed a Kimchi and Palmer task to measure their scope of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = S. E. | year = 1982 | title = Form and texture in hierarchically constructed patterns | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 521–535 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.8.4.521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that participants experienced narrowing attention following the high, but not the low motivational intensity film.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a"/&gt;

==== Goals ====

Hart and Gable examined the effect of low and high motivational intensity on positive affect. Participants were either asked to write about a positive event where someone was kind to them to induce low motivational intensity, write down a goal they want to accomplish and the steps it will take to accomplish it to induce high motivational intensity, or write about a typical day in their life, as a neutral control condition. Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated.  No effect occurred in the neutral condition, which suggests that motivational intensity alone did not impact goal pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = W. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2013 | title = Motivating goal pursuit: The role of affect motivational intensity and activated goals | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 922–926 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2013.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monetary Incentive ====

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2010a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010a | title = The effect of low versus high approach-motivated positive affect on memory for peripherally versus centrally presented information | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 599–603 | doi = 10.1037/a0018426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Attentional consequences of pre-goal and post-goal positive affects | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1358–1367 | doi = 10.1037/a0025611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have manipulated motivational intensity using a delayed monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants to respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. Half of the participants were told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares appeared on the screen (pre-goal; high motivational intensity).  Half of the participants were not given this instruction.  Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal-related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants’ memory for the words was tested.  Results suggested that compared to the neutral condition, high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.&lt;ref name="GHJ2010a"/&gt;
 
==== Pictures ====

Pictures varying in high and low motivational intensity have been used in a variety of different studies including time perception. Poole &amp; Gable asked participants to judge if pictures that were either high or low motivational intensity, appeared for long or short amount of time.&lt;ref name="PG2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poole | first1 = B. D. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2014 | title = Affective motivational direction drives asymmetric frontal hemisphere activation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 232 | issue = | pages = 2121–2130 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-014-3902-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures were high (e.g., pictures of desserts), or low (e.g., pictures of flowers) in motivational intensity or neutral images (e.g., geometric shapes) and have been used in previous experiments to induce motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008b | title = Relative left frontal activation to appetitive stimuli: Considering the role of individual differences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 275–278 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010b | title = Late positive potential to appetitive stimuli and local attentional bias | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 441–446 | doi=10.1037/a0018425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2009 | title = Neural activity underlying the effect of approach-motivated positive affect on narrowed attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 406–409 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02302.x | pmid=19298263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results demonstrated that participants’ perception of time was shorter when high motivational intensity pictures were presented compared to low motivational intensity or neutral pictures.&lt;ref name="PG2014"/&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt; (Experiment 2) used a neutral picture (e.g. rocks) or a high motivational intensity picture (e.g., dessert) appeared followed by the Navon letter task &lt;ref name="Navon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navon | first1 = D | year = 1977 | title = Forest before trees: The precedence of global features in visual perception | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 353–383 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(77)90012-3 |url=http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/Navon_global_CP77.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; to measure attentional scope. Results indicted that participants’ attention was narrowed following the high motivational intensity pictures, compared to the low motivational intensity pictures.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt; (Experiment 3) first measured overall approach motivation of participants using Carver and White’s (1994) Behavioral Inhibition Scale and Behavioral Activation Scales. Participants were presented with the dessert pictures used in Experiment 2 to induce high motivational intensity and baby pictures to induce low motivational intensity. Results showed that participants with higher Behavioral Activation scores in the beginning of the experiment showed more evidence of attentional narrowing following high motivational intensity pictures of desserts.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;  (Experiment 4) manipulated motivational intensity using pictures and participant’s expectancy to act. Participant’s viewed high motivational intensity pictures (e.g., desserts) or neutral pictures (e.g., paper plates) and half of the participants who viewed the high motivational intensity pictures of desserts were given the expectation that they would eat the desserts later, while the other half were not. Following the viewing of the pictures, participants completed the Navon letters task &lt;ref name="Navon" /&gt; to measure the scope of attention. Results suggested that participant’s attention narrowed the most when they viewed high motivational intensity pictures and were expected to consume them. This expectancy to consume the desserts showed further narrowing of attention than viewing high motivational intensity pictures alone.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010c | title = The blues broaden, but the nasty narrows attentional consequences of negative affects low and high in motivational intensity | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 211–215 | doi = 10.1177/0956797609359622 | pmid=20424047}}&lt;/ref&gt; induced motivational intensity using photos from the International Affective Picture System.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, P. J., Bradley, M. M., &amp; Cuthbert, B. N. (2005). International affective picture system (IAPS): Affective ratings of pictures and instruction manual. NIMH, Center for the Study of Emotion &amp; Attention.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures were negative or neutral. One picture was presented followed by one trial of the Navon letters task &lt;ref name="Navon" /&gt; to measure scope of attention. Results showed participants attention was broadened following low motivational intensity pictures, compared to the neutral picture.

A '''negative pregnant''' (sometimes called a '''pregnant denial''') refers to a denial which implies its affirmative opposite by seeming to deny only a qualification of the allegation and not the allegation itself.  For example, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars" might imply that the person making the statement owes some other sum of money, and was only denying that they owe that particular amount.  

A negative pregnant which appears in [[pleading]]s will often elicit a request for [[further and better particulars]], or an [[interrogatory]].  In order to avoid a negative pregnant in the above example, one might instead say, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars, or any other sum of money."

The issue can also arise in the context of [[statutory interpretation]]. For instance, Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] argues in his dissent to ''EEOC v. Aramco''&lt;ref&gt;''EEOC v. Aramco'' , 499 U.S. 244 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; that the presumption against [[extraterritoriality]] is rebutted by a negative inference from the alien-exemption provision of [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which states that Title VII "shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State." Marshall concludes that "Absent an intention that Title VII ''apply'' 'outside any State,' Congress would have had no reason to craft this extraterritorial exemption. And because only discrimination against aliens is exempted, employers remain accountable for discrimination against United States citizens abroad." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1838.ZD.html  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Co. (89-1838), at Cornell Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]], the '''ninety-ninety rule''' is a humorous [[aphorism]] that states:

{{quote |text=&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS QUOTE WITHOUT CHECKING THE ORIGINAL SOURCE! THE %'S ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOTAL 100%! --&gt;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90&lt;!-- YES THIS TOTALS 180%! THIS IS NOT AN ERROR! --&gt; percent of the development time.&lt;ref name="Bentley1985"/&gt; |sign=[[Tom Cargill]] |source=[[Bell Labs]]}}

This adds up to 180%, in a wry allusion to the notoriety of software development projects significantly over-running their schedules (see [[software development effort estimation]]). It expresses both the rough allocation of time to easy and hard portions of a programming project and the cause of the lateness of many projects as failure to anticipate the hard parts. In other words, it takes both more time and more coding than expected to complete a project.

The rule is attributed to Tom Cargill of [[Bell Labs]] and was made popular by [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Jon Bentley's]] September 1985 "Programming Pearls" column in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', in which it was titled the "Rule of Credibility".&lt;ref name="Bentley1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Jon|year=1985|title=Programming pearls: Bumper-Sticker Computer Science|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=28|issue=9|pages=896–901|issn=0001-0782|doi=10.1145/4284.315122|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Agile software development|agile software projects]], this rule also surfaces when a task is portrayed as "relatively done". This indicates a common scenario where planned work is completed but cannot be signed off, pending a single final activity which may not occur for a substantial amount of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20577">'''Occupational segregation''' is the distribution of [[worker]]s across and within [[Job|occupation]]s, based upon [[demographic]] characteristics, most often [[gender]].{{sfn|Bergmann|1981}}  Occupational segregation levels differ on a basis of perfect segregation and integration.  Perfect segregation occurs where any given occupation employs only one group.  Perfect integration, on the other hand, occurs where each group holds the same proportion of positions in an occupation as it holds in the labor force.{{sfn|Weeden|2007}}

Many scholars, such as Biblarz et al., argue that occupational segregation is most likely caused by [[sexism|gender-based discrimination]]{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}} that often occurs in patterns, either horizontally (across occupations) or vertically (within the hierarchy of occupations). Both of these contribute to the [[gender pay gap]].{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==Types==

===Horizontal===
Horizontal segregation refers to differences in the number of people of each gender present across occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy ([[post-industrial society]]), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the [[care work]] of their children and their homes,{{sfn|Charles|2003}} they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.

===Vertical===
The term ''vertical segregation'' describes men's domination of the highest status jobs in both traditionally male and traditionally female occupations.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Colloquially, the existence of vertical segregation is referred to as allowing men to ride in a "glass escalator" through which women must watch as men surpass them on the way to the top positions.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Karrie Ann and Adam Isaiah Green. 2008. "'Revisiting the Glass Escalator: The Case of Gender Segregation in a Female Dominated Occupation." Social Problems 55(2): 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the more occupational segregation present in a country, the less vertical segregation there is because women have a better chance of obtaining the highest positions in a given occupation as their share of employment in that particular occupation increases.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

Vertical segregation can be somewhat difficult to measure across occupations because it refers to hierarchies within individual occupations. For example, the category of Education Professionals, (a category in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations, Second Edition), is broken down into "School Teachers," "University and Vocational Education Teachers," and "Miscellaneous Education Professionals." These categories are then further broken down into subcategories. While these categories aptly describe the divisions within education, they are not comparable to the hierarchical categories within other occupations, and thus make comparisons of levels of vertical segregation quite difficult.{{sfn|Watts|2005}}

==Maintenance mechanisms==

===Self-selection===
Some women self-select out of higher status positions, choosing instead to have more time to spend at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions in order to maintain the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.{{sfn|Damaske|2004}}

===Educational disparities===
Human capital explanations are those that argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic success can be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences.{{sfn|Mincer|1891}} Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels of men and women is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Work experience disparities===
Human capital explanations also posit that men tend to rise to higher positions than women because of a disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates are more likely than males to interrupt their careers to raise children.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.

===Preferences===
Human capital explanations posit additionally that men are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

===Job search strategies===
According to sociologists Hanson and Pratt, men and women employ different strategies in their job searches that play a role in occupational segregation. These differing strategies are influenced by power relations in the household, the gendered nature of social life, and women's domestic responsibilities. The last factor, in particular, leads women to prioritize the geographical proximity of paid employment when searching for a job. In addition, most people have been found to find their jobs through informal contacts. The gendered nature of social life leads women to have networks with smaller geographical reach than men. Thus, the location of women in female-dominated occupations which are lower-status and lower pay is the result of "severe day-to-day time constraints" rather than a conscious and long-term choice made that would be able to maximize pay and prestige.{{sfn|Hanson|Pratt|1991}}

== Gender ==

===Gender pay gap===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
Women in female-dominated jobs pay two penalties: the average wage of their jobs is lower than that in comparable male-dominated jobs, and they earn less relative to men in the same jobs.  In addition, women's wages are negatively affected by the percentage of females in a job, but men's wages are essentially unaffected.{{sfn|Cohen|Bianchi|1999}}
The crowding hypothesis postulates that occupational segregation lowers all women's earnings as a result of women's exclusion from primarily male occupations and segregation into a number of predominantly female-dominated occupations.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}} Given that feminine skills are traditionally rewarded less both in salary and prestige, the crowding of women into certain occupations makes these occupations valued less in both pay and prestige.

Crowding is found to be alleviated through macro-changes in occupational segregation. Teaching, for example, at least in recent generations, is traditionally a female- dominated profession. However, when positions open up for women in business and other high-earning occupations, school boards must raise the salaries of potential teachers to attract candidates. This is an example of how even women in traditionally female-dominated professions still benefit salary-wise from the gendered integration of the market.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

=== Gendered division of labor ===
{{Main|Sexual division of labour}}
The gendered division of labor helps to explain the hierarchy of power across gender identity, class, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Mary Beth|date=|title=Gender and Inequality in the Global Labor Force|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=32|pages=41-62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminists]] contribute to this ideology through a Marxist frame of [[alienated labor]] and the [[means of production]]. [[Heidi Hartmann]] emphasized the gendered division of labor as patriarchal control over women's labor. Wally Saccombe suggested the mode of production should become a unity of production and reproduction, in which women's reproductive abilities are viewed as a valuable source of labor or income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burris|first=Val|date=|title=The Dialectic of Women's Oppression: Notes of the Relation Between Capitalism and Patriarchy|url=|journal=Berkeley Journal of Sociology|volume=27|pages=51-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The "wages for housework" movement in the late 1970s showcased the importance of gender inequality in the workplace. Socialist feminists critiqued the exploitation of women's household and reproductive labor, since it was not viewed as a commodity that deserved payment in the market economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergeron|first=Suzanne|date=|title=Formal, Informal, and Care Economies|url=|journal=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women often experience working a "double day" or "second shift" when they go to a wage-earning job and then come home to take care of children and the home&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminisms Matter|last=Bromley|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measurement==
Occupational segregation is measured using [[Duncan Segregation Index|Duncan's D]] (or the [[index of dissimilarity]]), which serves as a measure of dissimilarity between two distributions.  D has to be calculated first:

# Identify N different occupations.
# Calculate the percentage of men (or other ascribed category) who work in each of the occupations and the percentage of women who work in each occupation.  Give men and women a variable name (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = men, w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; could = women).
# Duncan's D is calculated using this formula: {{math|D{{=}}½ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}}} {{clarify|date=April 2012}}{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
#*It is important to note that Duncan's D uses percentages.  So in a given occupation, the number of men (or women) in that occupation should be divided by the total number of men (or women) in all of the occupations.  For example:  You may have 10 men who are nurses out of 600 total men.  The value for the occupation of male nurses should be 10/600, or .0166.

==In the United States{{anchor|Occupational_segregation_in_the_United_States}}==
Over the last century in the United States, there has been a surprising stability of segregation-index scores, which measure the level of occupational segregation of the labor market.{{sfn|Charles|2003}}  There were declines in occupational segregation in the 1970s and 1980s, as technologies that made the care work of the home quicker and easier allowed more women time to enter the workforce.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} However, occupational segregation remains a fixed element of the United States workforce today.
As recently as 1996, it has been found that gender occupational segregation over the past three generations has not decreased. In one study, grown women working in the 1980s were likely to have faced the same occupational segregation faced by their mothers working in the 1960s and their grandmothers working in the 1940s.{{sfn|Biblarz|Bengtson|Bucur|1996}}

==Solutions==
Gender egalitarian cultural principles, or changes in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation in that they reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures.{{sfn|Charles|2003}} Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women in the labor market might be changed.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

Some scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, therefore argue that any policies aimed at reducing occupational inequality must focus on culture changes.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}} According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim to provide benefits across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might be most effective.{{sfn|Haveman|Beresford|2012}}

In addition, the more occupational integration that occurs, the more women are in the positions to make powerful decisions affecting occupational segregation. If the overall market becomes less segregated, those who make personnel decisions in traditionally female-dominated occupations will have to make jobs, even higher status jobs, more attractive to women to retain them.  School boards, for example, will have to appoint more women to department head positions and other positions of authority in order to retain women workers, whereas those jobs might previously have gone to men.{{sfn|Cotter et al.|1997}}

==On the basis of sexual orientation==
In addition to gender, sexual orientation can also be a significant basis for occupational segregation: there is a  disproportionately high number of gay and lesbian workers in certain occupations. Research shows that gay men are more likely to be in female-majority occupations than are heterosexual men, and lesbians are more represented in male-majority occupations than are heterosexual women, but even after accounting for this tendency, common to both gay men and lesbians is a propensity to concentrate in occupations that provide task independence or require social perceptiveness, or both.{{sfn|Tilcsik|Anteby|Knight|2015}}

'''Outrage porn''' refers to any type of media that is designed to evoke [[Outrage (emotion)|outrage]] for the purpose getting traffic or attention online. The term ''outrage porn'' was coined by political [[cartoonist]] and [[essay|essayist]] Tim Kreider of The ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="COINED1"&gt; Kreider, Tim [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/isnt-it-outrageous/?_r=0 Isn’t It Outrageous?] ''New York Times''.

September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Coined in 2009, the term was later popularized by [[author]] and ''[[New York Observer|Observer]]'' media critic [[Ryan Holiday]].&lt;ref name="NYO1"&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2014/02/outrage-porn-how-the-need-for-perpetual-indignation-manufactures-phony-offense/ Outrage Porn: How the Need For 'Perpetual Indignation' Manufactures Phony Offense] ''New York Observer''.

==Overview==
Outrage porn is a term used to explain media that is created not in order to generate sympathy, but rather to cause anger or outrage among its consumers. It is characterized by insincere rage, umbrage and indignation.&lt;ref name="NYO1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leibovich, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/fake-outrage-in-the-kentucky-senate-race.html?_r=0 Fake Outrage in Kentucky] ''New York Times''. September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets are often incentivized to feign outrage because it specifically triggers many of the most lucrative online behaviors, including leaving comments, repeat pageviews and social sharing, which the outlets capitalize on.&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2014/10/rage-profiteers-how-blogs-harness-our-anger-for-their-own-gain/ Rage Profiteers: How Bloggers Harness Our Anger For Their Own Gain] ''New York Observer''. September 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon (website)|Salon]], [[Gawker]] and affiliated websites [[Valleywag]] and [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] have been noted for abusing the tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Daum, Meghan [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-daum-jezebel-effect-feminism-college-assault-20150601-story.html 'Jezebel Effect' poisons conversations on gender and sexual violence] ''Los Angeles Times''.

Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] conducted a study on the spreadability of emotions via social media and concluded that, "Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It makes you feel fired up, which makes you more likely to pass things on.”&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-emotion-goes-viral-fastest-180950182/?no-ist What Emotion Goes Viral the Fastest?] ''Smithsonian Magazine'', September 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Geoff [http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/03/rooney_mara_pan_tiger_lily_outrage_native_americans.html Rooney Mara to play Tiger Lily in new 'Pan' movie?

Tim Kreider makes a distinction between authentic outrage and outrage porn by stating, "I’m not saying that all outrage is inherently irrational, that we should all just calm down, that It’s All Good. All is not good...Outrage is healthy to the extent that it causes us to act against injustice.&lt;ref name="COINED1" /&gt;

'''Passive-aggressive behavior''' is characterized by indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Passive–aggressive|title=Passive–aggressive {{!}} Definition of Passive–aggressive|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality disorder==
{{main|Passive-aggressive personality disorder}}
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] [[DSM-IV|revision IV (DSM-IV)]] describes [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] as a "pervasive pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for adequate performance in social and occupational situations."

Passive-aggressiveness may not be necessarily a [[personality disorder]]. Personality disorder includes deviation in affectivity, cognition, control over impulses and need for gratification, ways of perceiving and thinking, and inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional behaviour. There must be [[personal distress]] attributable to such behaviour. Deviation must be stable and of long duration.

==Concept in different areas==

===Psychology===
In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors as procrastination, [[forgetfulness]], and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by [[authority figure]]s, but it can also occur in [[interpersonal]] contexts.&lt;ref name=dsmiv734&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatic Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0890420629|pages=733–734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: "a personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. Behaviors: learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Passive–aggressive%20personality%20disorder-diagnostic%20criteria|title=Passive–aggressive personality disorder-diagnostic criteria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of passive-aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, "playing the victim", feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellor-articles/what-is-Passive–aggressive-behaviour|title=What is Passive Aggressive Behaviour?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/Passive–aggressive-diaries/201011/10-things-Passive–aggressive-people-say|title=10 Things Passive–aggressive People Say|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
In [[conflict theory]], passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as [[wiktionary:catty|catty]], as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Simon|first=George|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People|year=2010|publisher=Parkhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. In the ad for Warner's online ebook, it says: "The worst case of passive-aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency." {{fact|date=February 2018}} If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harms | first = Kimberly A. | title = Passive Aggressive Behaviour in the Dental Office | edition = 3 |date=May–June 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says, "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Angelis | first = Paula | title = Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive–aggressive Leadership in the Workplace | page = 3 | year = 2009 | isbn = 1442159200 |publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Passive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel [[William Menninger]] during [[World War II]] in the context of men's reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their aggressiveness "by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" due to what Menninger saw as an "immaturity" and a reaction to "routine military stress".&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Citation|last = Lane | first=C |title=The Surprising History of Passive–aggressive Personality Disorder|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi= 10.1177/0959354308101419| format = [[PDF]] | url = https://sites.northwestern.edu/christopher-lane/files/2016/08/lanedocpapd2009-24w8s9n.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

The '''Plantation Act 1740''' ([[Plantation (settlement or colony)|referring to colonies]]) or the '''Naturalization Act 1740'''&lt;ref&gt;The act received Royal Assent in 1740. However, it was formally dated as 1739 in older official uses because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force, acts were dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1739.&lt;/ref&gt; are common names&lt;ref name="LB-US I&amp;N"&gt;Michael Lemay, Elliott Robert Barkan, [https://www.questia.com/read/6846180/u-s-immigration-and-naturalization-laws-and-issues U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Laws and Issues: A Documentary History], pp 6-9.

The act became effective 1 June 1740 and allowed any Protestant [[Alien (law)|alien]] residing in any of their [[British America|American colonies]] for seven years, without being absent from that colony for more than two months, would be deemed to be one of "his Majesty’s natural-born subjects of [[Great Britain|this Kingdom]]." The act also required making specific declarations concerning royal allegiance and succession, profession of the Christian faith, and the payment of two shillings.  Compared to other alternatives available at the time, the act provided a cheap and easy method of imperial naturalization, and the length of residency was not unreasonable.&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"&gt;Clive Parry, [http://www.uniset.ca/naty/parry.htm British Nationality Law and the History of Naturalisation], Milano, Giuffrè (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Reflecting the situation in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[English Civil War]], [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Restoration (England)]] and [[Nonconformist]]s&lt;/ref&gt; the necessary profession of [[Christian]] faith was distinctly [[Protestant]] and specifically [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The act was not intended for conscientious [[Roman Catholics]], and they were referred to in the law as [[Papists]]. Exceptions however for non-conforming religious scruples and conscience were made, in the case of [[Quakers]] and [[Jews]]. Adherents of both faiths were allowed to dispense with the Sacramental test, with the former being [[Quakers Act 1695|allowed to affirm]] the oaths, and the latter being relieved of the obligation to repeat the words 'Upon the true faith of a Christian', at the end of the Oath of Abjuration required by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] since 1701.&lt;ref name="Henriq-PREJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henriques |first=H. S. Q. |date=Jan 1907 |title=The Political Rights of English Jew |jstor=1451130 |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=298–341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see, [[Abjuration#English Commonwealth|Oath of Abjuration]], [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)#Historical oaths|Oath of Allegiance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plantation Act was enacted to systematize naturalization procedures in all localities as well as to encourage immigration to the American colonies.&lt;ref name="LB-US I&amp;N"/&gt;  The act provided a workable naturalization procedure by empowering colonial courts to administer the oath of allegiance to aliens.&lt;ref name="Kettner Rev2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=Willi Paul |date=Autumn 1979 |title=Review of ''The Development of American Citizenship, 1608-1870 by James H.

The act endowed colonial courts with the responsibility of deciding when alien petitioners had fulfilled the statutory requirements for imperial citizenship.  In proprietary colonies, the judges were appointed by colonial governors and thus represented the royal or proprietary interest.   However, by delegating authority to colonial officials, Parliament subjected naturalization to the pressure of the same local interest groups that increasingly defied the governor's efforts to implement royal and proprietary instructions on other issues.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"&gt;Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5gJ3tOl20eYC&amp;pg=PA63&amp; "Asylum for Mankind": America, 1607-1800], p.63-69, 124-127. Cornell University Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the penalties imposed under the act, only six Secretaries of the thirteen American Colonies and one in the West Indies submitted the mandated lists.&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"/&gt;

==Development==
In England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several basic statutes applied to naturalization,&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Naturalization p. 257-258 ''ff'' "The following are the basic statutes on naturalization which applied in England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: 7 Jas. I, c. 2, [1609, [[Naturalization and restoration of blood]]]; 15 Carl. II, c. 15, [[Linen Cloth Act 1663]]; 6 Anne, c. 37, [[Duties on East India Goods Act 1707]];  7 Anne, c. 5, [[Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708]];  13 Geo. II, c. 3, [[Supply of Seamen Act 1739]];  22 Geo. II, c. 45, [[Whale Fishery Act 1748]];  26 Geo. II, c. 26, [[Jewish Naturalization Act 1753]]."&lt;/ref&gt; but these statutes would not include many aliens in the colonies who were considered an integral part of the colonial communities.  Over the same time period, the American provinces (except [[New Hampshire]]) passed their own naturalization laws, which granted citizenship to people living within their province. These laws were based more on local colonial interpretations of community citizenship than on stricter considerations in the mother-country. but they gave no rights beyond their borders. This situation was initially accepted as positive and workable in England, but proved to be too inconsistent with and  broader imperial intentions as time passed.

Britain began withdrawing support to promote immigration to the colonies at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]].  Colonial implementation both before and after the Plantation Act tended to ignore, evade, and reshape English regulations, thus vitiating many policy decisions and generating a chaotic array of citizenship procedures.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;  The [[Navigation Acts]] were a particular target for evasion, since they were seen as acting more as restraint on both colonial naturalization and its peoples' ability to take part fully in the economy.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyt-NatinAC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoyt |first=Edward A. |date=June 1952 |title=Naturalization Under the American Colonies: Signs of a New Community |jstor=2145724 |journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] |publisher=[[Academy of Political Science]] |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=248–266 | doi = 10.2307/2145724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonial naturalization of aliens was outright forbidden in December 1773,&lt;ref name="Hoyt-NatinAC"/&gt; under any conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Baeler, Asylum, p. 125 "Each royal governor was instructed "that you do not upon any pretense whatsoever give your assent to any Bill or Bills that may have been or shall hereafter be passed by the Council and Assembly of the Province under your Government for the naturalization of Aliens...nor for establishing a Title in any Person to Lands, Tennements &amp; real estates in your said Province originally granted to, or purchased by Aliens antecedent to Naturalization."&lt;/ref&gt;   A ban on royal land grants, initiated earlier in 1773, was made final in February 1774.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;

Most [[economic model]]s rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and there is a growing literature debunking economics and economic models.

== Restrictive, unrealistic assumptions ==

Provably unrealistic assumptions are pervasive in neoclassical economic theory (also called the "standard theory" or "neoclassical paradigm"), and those assumptions are inherited by simplified models for that theory. (Any model based on a flawed theory, cannot transcend the limitations of that theory.) [[Joseph Stiglitz]]' 2001 Nobel Prize lecture reviews his work on [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]],&lt;ref name="stiglitz"&gt;Joseph E. Stiglitz. 2001 Nobel Prize lecture: {{cite web|title=Information and the change in the paradigm of economics| 
url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the assumption, in standard models, of "perfect information".  Stiglitz surveys many aspects of these faulty standard models, and the faulty policy implications
and recommendations that arise from their unrealistic assumptions.

Economic models can be such powerful tools in understanding some economic relationships that it is easy to ignore their limitations. One tangible example where the limits of economic models allegedly collided with reality, but were nevertheless accepted as "evidence" in public policy debates, involved models to simulate the effects of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.  James Stanford published his examination of 10 of these models.&lt;ref&gt;James Stanford.  "Continental Economic Integration: Modeling the Impact on Labor," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Mar 1993, V526 pp. 92–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Stanford. 1993. {{cite web|title=Free Trade and the Imaginary Worlds of Economic Modelers |url=http://www.pcdf.org/1993/45stanfo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental issue is circularity:  embedding one's assumptions as foundational "input" axioms in a model, then proceeding to "prove" that, indeed, the model's "output" supports the validity of those assumptions. Such a model is consistent with similar models that have adopted those same assumptions. But is it consistent with reality? As with any scientific theory, empirical validation is needed, if we are to have any confidence in its predictive ability.

If those assumptions are, in fact, fundamental aspects of empirical reality, then the model's output will correctly describe reality (if it is properly "tuned", and if it is not missing any crucial assumptions).  But if those assumptions are not valid for the particular aspect of reality one attempts to simulate, then it becomes a case of "GIGO" – Garbage In, Garbage Out".

James Stanford outlines this issue for the specific [[Computable general equilibrium|Computable General Equilibrium]] ("CGE") models that were introduced as evidence into the public policy debate,  by advocates for NAFTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Aponte |title=NAFTA and Mexican Migration to Michigan and the U.S. |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/upload/working-papers/wp25.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Crawford. 1996. {{Citation|title=Computer-assisted Crises|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prominence of Stiglitz' 2001 Nobel prize lecture, the use of arguably misleading neoclassical models persisted in 2007, according to these authors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projected Benefits of the Doha Round Hinge on Misleading Trade Models |url=http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/policynotes/Doha%20Policy%20Note%20Final%2003_12_07.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working paper,
"Debunking the Myths of Computable General Equilibrium Models",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Computable General Equilibrium Models |url=http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/workingpapers/SCEPA%20Working%20Paper%202008-1%20Kahn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325161535/http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/workingpapers/SCEPA%20Working%20Paper%202008-1%20Kahn.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}
SCEPA Working Paper 01-2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;
provides both a history, and a readable theoretical analysis
of what CGE models are, and are not.  In particular, despite their name,
CGE models use neither the Walrass general equilibrium,
nor the Arrow-Debreus General Equilibrium frameworks.
Thus, CGE models are highly distorted simplifications of theoretical frameworks—collectively called "the neoclassical economic paradigm"—which—themselves—were largely discredited by Joseph Stiglitz.

In the "Concluding Remarks" (p.&amp;nbsp;524) of his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture, Stiglitz examined why the neoclassical paradigm—and models based on it—persists, despite his publication, over a decade earlier, of some of his seminal results showing that Information Asymmetries invalidated core Assumptions of that paradigm
and its models:

In the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global economic meltdown, the profession's alleged attachment to unrealistic models is increasingly being questioned and criticized.  After a weeklong workshop, one group of economists released a paper highly critical of their own profession's allegedly unethical use of unrealistic models. Their ''Abstract'' offers an indictment of fundamental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Colander | first1 = D. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = M. | last3 = Haas | first3 = A. | last4 = Juselius | first4 = K. | last5 = Kirman | first5 = A. | last6 = Lux | first6 = T. | last7 = Sloth | first7 = B. | doi = 10.1080/08913810902934109 | title = The Financial Crisis and the Systemic Failure of the Economics Profession | journal = Critical Review | volume = 21 | issue = 2–3 | page = 249 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omitted details ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
A great danger inherent in the simplification required to fit the entire economy into a model is omitting critical elements. Some economists believe that making the model as simple as possible is an [[art|art form]], but the details left out are often contentious. For instance:
* Market models often exclude [[externality|externalities]] such as [[pollution]]. Such models are the basis for many [[environmentalist]] attacks on mainstream [[economist]]s. It is said that if the social costs of externalities were included in the models their conclusions would be very different, and models are often accused of leaving out these terms because of economist's pro-[[free market]] bias.
* In turn, [[environmental economics]] has been accused of omitting key financial considerations from its models. For example, the returns to [[solar power]] investments are sometimes modelled without a [[discount factor]], so that the present [[utility]] of solar energy delivered in a century's time is precisely equal to gas-power station energy today.
*  [[Financial modeling|Financial models]] can be oversimplified by relying on historically unprecedented [[arbitrage]]-free markets, probably underestimating the [[kurtosis|chance of crises]], and under-pricing or under-planning for [[risk]].
*It  is possible that any missing variable as well as errors in values of included variables can lead to erroneous results.
* [[Model risk]]: There is a significant amount of model risk inherent in the current mathematical modeling approaches to economics that one must take into account when using them. A good economic theory should be built on sound economic principles tested on many free markets, and proven to be valid. However, empirical facts have been alleged to indicate that the principles of economics hold only under very limited conditions that are rarely met in real life, and there is no scientific testing methodology available to validate hypotheses. Decisions based on economic theories that are not scientifically possible to test can give people a false sense of precision, and that could be misleading, leading to build up logical errors.
*[[Natural economics]]:  Economics is concerned with  both  'normal' and  'abnormal' economic conditions. In an objective scientific study one is not restricted by the normality assumption in describing actual economies, as much empirical evidence shows that some "anomalous" behavior can persist for a long time in real markets e.g., in market "bubbles" and market "herding".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927220919/http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&amp;nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&amp;Delta;h]]=3.3*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s*10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*135&amp;nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.
&lt;!--
These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

"14*3300 bars m^3/sec" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~

==Development==
In 2006 a 50&amp;nbsp;kW plant was located at a coastal test site in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/book/export/html/2243 Blue energy]&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being on prevention of [[biofouling]] of the [[anode]], [[cathode]], and membranes and increasing the membrane performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbk.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/JMembrSciVeerman/2008JMembrSciVeerman.pdf electrodialysis stacks by a validated model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netserver2.net/waterforum/index.asp?url=/template_a1.asp&amp;que=paginanr=3716 Friese wereldprimeur met stroomproductie uit zoet-zout water]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Directorate for Public Works and Water Management, Redstack, and ENECO signed a declaration of intent for development of a pilot plant on the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporateuk.eneco.nl/pages/default.asp?PageID=60&amp;Mainmenu=News%20and%20media&amp;MainmenuID=45&amp;Mainmenusub=Press%20releases&amp;MainmenusubID=60&amp;ShowNieuws=13424&amp;ModuleitemID=424 Electricity from fresh and salt water]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was put into service on 26 November 2014 and produces 50 kW of electricity to show the technical feasibility in real-life conditions using fresh IJsselmeer water and salt water from the Wadden Sea. Theoretically, with 1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s river water and an equal amount of sea water, approximately 1 MW of renewable electricity can be recovered at this location by upscaling the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch King opens world's first RED power plant driven on fresh-salt water mixing|url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|publisher=Dutch Water Sector|accessdate=4 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092205/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be expected that after this phase the installation could be further expanded to a final capacity of 200 MW.

A '''[[riparian]] buffer''' or '''stream buffer''' is a [[vegetation|vegetated]] area (a "[[buffer strip]]") near a [[stream]], usually [[forest]]ed, which helps shade and partially protect the stream from the impact of adjacent [[land use]]s.  It plays a key role in increasing [[water quality]] in associated streams, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s, thus providing environmental benefits.  With the decline of many [[aquatic ecosystems]] due to [[agriculture]], riparian buffers have become a very common [[conservation ethic|conservation]] practice aimed at increasing water quality and reducing [[water pollution|pollution]].

== Benefits ==
Riparian buffers act to intercept [[sediment]], [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other materials in [[surface runoff]] and reduce nutrients and other [[pollutants]] in shallow subsurface water flow.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). (2006).
[ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/391.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Riparian Forest Buffer."] Code 391. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve to provide [[habitat]] and [[wildlife corridor]]s in primarily agricultural areas.  They can also be key in reducing [[erosion]] by providing [[stream bank]] stabilization.

=== Water quality benefits ===
*Intercepting sediments/nutrients - Key to counteract [[eutrophication]] in downstream lakes and ponds which can be detrimental to aquatic habitats because of large [[fish kill]]s that occur upon large-scale eutrophication.
*Intercepting pesticides - Riparian buffers keep chemicals that can be harmful to aquatic life out of the water.  Some pesticides can be especially harmful if they [[bioaccumulate]] in the organism, with the chemicals reaching harmful levels once they are ready for human consumption.
*Bank stabilization - This is important because erosion can be a major problem in agricultural regions when cut (eroded) banks can take land out of production.  Erosion can also lead to [[sedimentation]] and [[siltation]] of downstream lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.  Siltation can greatly reduce the life span of [[reservoir]]s and the [[dam]]s that create the reservoirs.

=== Habitat benefits ===
*Provide habitat - Riparian buffers can act as crucial habitat for a large number of species, especially those who have lost [[habitat]] due to agricultural land being put into production.
*Increase biodiversity - By adding this vegetated area of land near a water source it becomes a prime location for species that may have left the area due to non-conservation land use to re-establish.  With this re-establishment the number of native species and [[biodiversity]] in general can be increased.
*Buffers acting as corridors - Buffers also serve a major role in wildlife habitat. The habitat provided by the buffers also double as corridors for species that have had their habitat fragmented by various land uses.
*Shading water - The large [[tree]]s in the first zone of the riparian buffer provide shade and therefore cooling for the water, increasing productivity and increasing habitat quality for aquatic species.
*[[Large woody debris]] - When branches and stumps fall into the stream from the [[riparian zone]], more stream habitat features are created. [[Carbon]] is added as an energy source for [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] in the stream.

=== Economic benefits ===
*Increase land value - Often people who purchase land for recreational use are willing to pay more if there is more wooded area located on the land.
*Produce profitable alternative crops - Vegetation such as [[Black Walnut]] and [[Hazelnut]], which can be profitably harvested, can be incorporated into the riparian buffer.
*Increase lease fees for hunting - The increased habitat means that the land will be more sought-after for hunting purposes.

== Buffer design ==
[[File:Late Winter Afternoon in Munson Park Wetlands.webm|thumb|Ground level view of riparian buffer between Munson Pond (off camera left) and an agricultural operation (off camera right)]]

A riparian buffer is usually split into three different zones, each having its own specific purpose for filtering runoff and interacting with the adjacent aquatic system. Buffer design is a key element in the effectiveness of the buffer.  It is generally recommended that native species be chosen to plant in these three zones, with the general width of the buffer being {{convert|50|ft|m}} on each side of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;Dosskey, M., Schultz, D., &amp; Isenhart, T. (1997). [https://fs.usda.gov/nac/documents/agroforestrynotes/an03rfb02.pdf "Riparian Buffers for Agricultural Land."] ''Agroforestry Notes,'' No. 3, January 1997. National Agroforestry Center, USDA Forest Service, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 1.''' This zone should function mainly to shade the water source and act as a bank stabilizer.  The zone should include large native tree species that grow fast and can quickly act to perform these tasks.  Although this is usually the smallest of the three zones and absorbs the fewest contaminants, most of the contaminants have been eliminated by Zone 2 and Zone 3.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"&gt;Maryland Cooperative Extension.  "Riparian Forest Buffer Design, Establishment, and Maintenance." University of Maryland, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 2.''' Usually made up of native [[shrubs]], this zone provides a habitat for wildlife, including nesting areas for [[bird]] species.  This zone also acts to slow and absorb contaminants that Zone 3 has missed.  The zone is an important transition between grassland and forest.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Zone 3.''' This zone is important as the first line of defense against contaminants.  It consists mostly of native [[grass]]es and serves primarily to slow water runoff and begin to absorb contaminants before they reach the other zones.  Although these grass strips should be one of the widest zones, they are also the easiest to install.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Streambed Zone.''' The streambed zone of the riparian area is linked closely to Zone 1.  Zone 1 provides fallen limbs, trees, and tree roots that in turn slow water flow, reducing erosional processes associated with increased water flow and flooding. This woody debris also increases habitat and cover for various aquatic species

The [https://fs.usda.gov/nac National Agroforestry Center] has developed a Filter Strip Design tool ([https://fs.usda.gov/nac/tools/AgBufferBuilder.htm AgBufferBuilder]), which is a GIS-based computer program for designing vegetative filter strips around agricultural fields that utilizes terrain analysis to account for spatially non-uniform runoff.

== Managing forests in riparian area ==
[[Logging]] is sometimes recommended as a management practice in riparian buffers, usually to provide economic incentive. However, some studies have shown that logging can harm wildlife populations, especially birds.  A study by the University of Minnesota found that there was a correlation between the harvesting of timber in riparian buffers and a decline in bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Wildlife Management; Apr 2005, Vol. 69 Issue 2, p689-698, 10p&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, logging is generally discouraged as an environmental practice, and left to be done in designated logging areas.

== Conservation incentives ==
The [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP), a farming assistance program in the [[United States]], provides many incentives to landowners to encourage them to install riparian buffers around water systems that have a high chance of non-point water pollution and are highly erodible. For example, the [[Nebraska]] system of Riparian Buffer Payments offers the following:
*Annual rental payments = $62 to $116 per acre/year (up to $96 per acre per year for certain marginal pasture land)
*Sign up bonus: up-front payment of $10 per acre/year for the life of the contract (Example: $150/ac for a fifteen-year contract)
*Payments for 90% of costs for trees, shrubs, grass seed, site preparation and planting
*10 to 15 year contracts
*Eligible areas:
**Up to {{convert|180|ft|m}} average width along each side of a continuous or intermittent stream
**Strips of grass, shrubs, and/or trees can be used
**Planting done by the local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs)	

These incentives are offered to agriculturists to compensate them for their economic loss of taking this land out of production.  If the land is highly erodible and produces little economic gain, it can sometimes be more economic to take advantage of these CRP programs.&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension. "Benefits of Riparian Forest Buffers (Streamside Plantings of Trees, Shrubs and Grasses)."  University Press, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Riparian buffers have undergone much scrutiny about their effectiveness, resulting in thorough testing and monitoring.  A study done by the [[University of Georgia]], conducted over a nine-year period, monitored the amounts of fertilizers that reached the watershed from the source of the application.  It found that these buffers removed at least 60% of the [[nitrogen]] in the runoff, and at least 65% of the [[phosphorus]] from the fertilizer application.   The same study showed that the effectiveness of the Zone 3 was much greater than that of both Zone 1 and 2 at removing contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, Sharon. "Riparian Buffers Effective."  Southeast Farm Press. 4 Feb 2004. p26&lt;/ref&gt;. But another recent study did not find efficiency (or a very limiting capacity) for reducing glyphosate and AMPA leaching to streams ; Spontaneous herbaceous vegetation RBS is as efficient as Salix plantations and mesures of Glyphosate in runoff after a year&lt;ref name=study2017effic/&gt;, suggest an unexpected persistence and even a capacity of RBS to potentially favor glyphosate infiltration up to 70 cm depth in the soil&lt;ref name=study2017effic&gt;Hénault-Ethier, L., Lucotte, M., Moingt, M., Paquet, S., Maccario, S., Smedbol, É., ... &amp; Labrecque, M. (2017). ''[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717309397#f0030 Herbaceous or Salix miyabeana ‘SX64’narrow buffer strips as a means to minimize glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid leaching from row crop fields]''. Science of the Total Environment, 598, 1177-1186.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Long-term sustainability ==
After the initial installation of the riparian buffer, relatively little maintenance needs to be performed to keep the buffer in good condition.  Once the trees and grasses reach maturity, they regenerate naturally and make a more effective buffer.  The sustainability of the riparian buffer makes it extremely attractive to landowners, since they do relatively little work and still receive payments. Riparian buffers have the potential to be the most effective ways to protect aquatic biodiversity, water quality and manage water resources in developing countries that lack the funds to install water treatment and supply systems in midsize and small towns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6775">The '''Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia''' ('''SADS''')&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SADS is not available via the major psychological test companies, but must be obtained directly from one of its coauthors, Jean Endicott, PhD, Professor of Clinical Psychology (in Psychiatry) at Columbia University Medical Center via email (je10 [at] columbia [dot] edu) or fax (212-543-5386). Keep in mind that the SADS does not map as precisely onto current nosology, i.e., DSM-5, compared to diagnostic structured interviews such as the [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]].&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collection of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and symptom rating scales originally published in 1978.&lt;ref name= Endicott&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endicott | first1 = J | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL | year = 1978 | title = A diagnostic interview: the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/35/7/837 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 837–43 | pmid = 678037 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1978.01770310043002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized as a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The structured aspect is that every interview asks screening questions about the same set of disorders regardless of the presenting problem; and positive screens get explored with a consistent set of symptoms. These features increase the sensitivity of the interview and the inter-rater reliability (or reproducibility) of the resulting diagnoses. The SADS also allows more flexibility than fully structured interviews: Interviewers can use their own words and rephrase questions, and some clinical judgment is used to score responses. There are three versions of the schedule, the regular SADS, the lifetime version (SADS-L) and a version for measuring the change in symptomology (SADS-C). Although largely replaced by more structured interviews that follow diagnostic criteria such as [[DSM-IV]] and DSM-5, and specific mood rating scales, versions of the SADS are still used in some research papers today.

==Diagnoses covered==
The diagnoses covered by the interview include [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorders]] and a limited number of other fairly common diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==Relationship with the Research Diagnostic Criteria==
The SADS was developed by the same group of rearchers as the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] (RDC). While the RDC is a list of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders, the SADS interview allows diagnoses based on RDC criteria to be made, and also rates subject's symptoms and level of functioning.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==K-SADS==
The '''[[Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia|K-SADS]]''' (or '''Kiddie-SADS''') is a version of the SADS adapted for [[school-age]]d children of 6–18 years. There are various different versions of the K-SADS, each varying slightly in terms of disorders and specific symptoms covered, as well as the scale range used. All of the variations are still semi-structured interviews, giving the interviewer more flexibility about how to phrase and probe items, while still covering a consistent set of disorders.

The K-SADS-E (Epidemiological version) was developed for epidemiological research. It focused on current issues and episodes only. Most of the items used a four point rating scale.

The [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/assessments/ksads-pl.pdf K-SADS-PL] (Present and Lifetime version) is administered by interviewing the parent(s), the child, and integrating them into a summary rating that includes parent report, child report, and clinical observations during the interview. The interview covers both present issues (i.e., the reason the family is seeking an evaluation) as well as past episodes of the disorders. Most items use a three point rating scale for severity (not present, subthreshold, and threshold—which combines both moderate and severe presentations). It has been used with preschool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birmaher|first=Boris|last2=Ehmann|first2=Mary|last3=Axelson|first3=David A.|last4=Goldstein|first4=Benjamin I.|last5=Monk|first5=Kelly|last6=Kalas|first6=Catherine|last7=Kupfer|first7=David|last8=Gill|first8=Mary Kay|last9=Leibenluft|first9=Ellen|date=2009-04-01|title=Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-PL) for the Assessment of Preschool Children- A Preliminary Psychometric Study|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=43|issue=7|pages=680–686|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.10.003|issn=0022-3956|pmc=2736874|pmid=19000625}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as school-aged children. A [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/node/8234 2009 working draft] removed all reference to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III-R]] criteria (which were replaced with the publication of the DSM-IV in 1994) and made some other modifications. A DSM-5 version is being prepared and validated.

'''Section&amp;nbsp;116 of the [[Constitution of Australia]]''' precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (''i.e.'', the federal parliament) from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. Section&amp;nbsp;116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] constitutional conventions, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is based on similar provisions in the [[United States Constitution]]. However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]] from making such laws.

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted narrowly by the [[High Court of Australia]]: while the definition of "religion" adopted by the court is broad and flexible, the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed. The result of the court's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116, and the provision has played only a minor role in [[Constitutional history of Australia|Australian constitutional history]]. Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools, that authorised the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]], and that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families.

[[Federal Government of Australia|Federal Governments]] have twice proposed the amendment of Section&amp;nbsp;116, principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states. On each occasion—in [[Australian referendum, 1944|1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)|1988]]—the proposal failed in a referendum.

==Text of the provision and location in the Constitution==

Section&amp;nbsp;116 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|116}} Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has four limbs.  The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws: laws "for establishing any religion"; laws "for imposing any religious observance"; and laws "for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".  The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackshield &amp; Williams|2010|p=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the "establishing religion" and "prohibiting free exercise" limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;

The section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution, which deals with the states of Australia.  However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 does not apply to the states.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state has its own constitution, and only Tasmania's has a provision similar to Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|2009|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section&amp;nbsp;116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|La Nauze|1972|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|left|[[H. B. Higgins]], proponent of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions|alt=A black and white portrait of [[H. B. Higgins]]]]

The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft of Section&amp;nbsp;116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws.&lt;ref name="QG"&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate [[H. B. Higgins]] expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section&amp;nbsp;116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2002|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed inclusion of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898.  Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the "ultimate source of law", while convention delegates [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Patrick Glynn]] moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] campaigned for a strict separation of church and state, being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives: Section&amp;nbsp;116 was approved by the final convention, while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of "Almighty God" in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 (the colonies thus became the states of Australia).&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irving|1999|pp=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 reflects two provisions of the [[United States Constitution]]: the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion; and [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;VI]], Section&amp;nbsp;3, which [[No religious test clause|prohibits the imposition of religious tests]] for public offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cumbrae-Stewart|1946|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1951|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section&amp;nbsp;116 a "fairly blatant piece of transcription" of its US counterparts.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pannam|1963|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial consideration==

The High Court's consideration of Section&amp;nbsp;116 has generally been limited to three areas: the definition of "religion"; the meaning of "law for establishing any religion"; and the meaning of "law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt;  The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1228}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section&amp;nbsp;116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1994|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of "religion"===

A threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a "religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)''.&lt;ref name="Church of New Faith"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were "impenetrably obscure". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice.&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt; Justices [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] and [[Gerard Brennan]] held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the criteria of religion [are] twofold: first, belief in a supernatural, Being, Thing or Principle; and second, the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Mason and Brennan JJ at para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] were less prescriptive, setting out five "indicia" of a religion: a belief in the supernatural; a belief in ideas relating to "man's nature and place in the universe"; the adherence to particular standards, codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas; the existence of an identifiable group of believers, even if not a formal organisation; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1209–1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Wilson and Deane JJ at para. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Establishing any religion"===

The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of ''[[Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth]]'' (the ''DOGS'' case),&lt;ref name="DOGS HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1981|litigants=[[Attorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth]] ("DOGS case") |parallelcite=(1981) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 559 |date=2 February 1981 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Garfield Barwick]] held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its "express and single purpose", while Justice [[Harry Gibbs]] argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion.  Each justice in the majority contrasted Section&amp;nbsp;116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section&amp;nbsp;116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting "establishment of religion" generally, whereas the prohibition in Section&amp;nbsp;116 is against the establishment of "''any'' religion": this meant that Section&amp;nbsp;116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section&amp;nbsp;116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Robert Garran]] in 1901, that establishment means "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others."&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Prohibiting the free exercise of any religion"===

The protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1217–1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the court in ''Krygger v Williams'',&lt;ref name="Krygger"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|65|1912|litigants=Krygger v Williams |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/65.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 366] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"/&gt; The court considered that Section&amp;nbsp;116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as ''[[obiter dictum]]'') that a person could lawfully object to [[compulsory voting]] on the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in ''Krygger v Williams'', upholding war-time regulations that caused the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an "organ of [[Satan]]". Chief Justice [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] held that the Constitution permitted the court to "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1218–1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1943|litigants=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Incorporated v Commonwealth |link=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/12.pdf (1943) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 116] |courtname=auto}} per Latham CJ at para. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 case known as the [[Kruger v Commonwealth|''Stolen Generations Case'']],&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1997|litigants=[[Kruger v Commonwealth]] (Stolen Generations case) |parallelcite=(1997) 190 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families. The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1223–1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section&amp;nbsp;116 will only "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"/&gt;

==Commentary==

When the Constitution took effect in 1901, Quick and Garran argued that Section&amp;nbsp;116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section&amp;nbsp;51]] to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded "by all as having little practical value". Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"/&gt;

Constitutional scholar [[George Williams (lawyer)|George Williams]], writing in 1994, criticised the court's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution, saying the court has "transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties". Williams argues that as an "express guarantee of personal freedom", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote "individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power".&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section&amp;nbsp;116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of ''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|45|1992|litigants=[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 106 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defence of Section&amp;nbsp;116 and the High Court's interpretation of it, Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited, suggesting that a rigid "wall of separation" between religion and the state is undesirable, and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160" /&gt; Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights,&lt;ref name="Hanks1227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1227}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has "symbolic value". Booker and Glass defend the court's interpretation of the provision and other Constitutional rights, saying "the High Court can only work with the constitutional provisions before it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker &amp; Glass|2009|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referendums==
{{See also |Australian referendum, 1944 |Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)}}
Federal governments have twice proposed [[Referendums in Australia|referendums]] to expand the scope of Section&amp;nbsp;116: in 1944 and in 1988. In 1944, [[John Curtin]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government put a package of measures, known as the "Fourteen Powers referendum", to the Australian public. The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers for the purposes of post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would [[sunset provision|sunset]] after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section&amp;nbsp;116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The package's 14 measures—which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for "national health"—were bound together in a single question. [[H. V. Evatt]], the Labor [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], argued that [[freedom of religion]] was "fundamental to the whole idea of democracy" and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Galligan |1995 |p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[United Australia Party]], then in opposition and led by [[Robert Menzies]], campaigned against the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Nethercote |2001 |p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Fadden]], leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], claimed a "yes" vote would permit the government to implement a "policy of socialisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6UwQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=75QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7101,5695609&amp;hl=en |title=Country Party's "No" Campaign |date=25 July 1944 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package was rejected: the national "yes" vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/Referendum_Dates_and_Results.htm |title=Referendum Dates and Results 1906 – present |work=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Scott |title=Constitutional Referenda in Australia |publisher=Department of the Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia |location=Canberra |year=1999 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207163730/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar proposal to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988. The referendum contained four questions, the last of which sought to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 and other constitutional "rights and freedoms". Again, the proposal was initiated by a Labor government (under [[Bob Hawke]]); again, the proposal was opposed by the conservative parties;&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt; and again, multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question, being "to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury, to extend freedom of religion, and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government." The proposal in respect of Section&amp;nbsp;116 was to extend its operation to the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=tq9EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5910,5678604&amp;dq=referendum+religion+states+constitution+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Political maturity put to the test |last=Hamer |first=Rupert |date=9 August 1988 |work=[[The Age]] |p=13 |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expand the protection to cover any government act (not just legislation) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some church officials objected to the proposal, fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=U1kpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3303,3701810&amp;dq=referendum+religion+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Bishops to deal blow on referendum |last=Grattan |first=Michelle |author2=Doogue, Edmund  |date=15 August 1988 |work=The Age |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bowen assurance to schools on 'yes' vote |last=Seccombe |first=Mike |date=16 August 1988 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question failed to pass, being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states.&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional change : select sources on constitutional change in Australia 1901–1997 |publisher=House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs |location=Canberra, Australia |year=1997 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-644-48410-1 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/House/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050719100831/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |2002 |p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it, highlighting the "determined and effective" opposition of senior [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] politician [[Peter Reith]].&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/frozen-continent/2008/03/28/1206207408050.html?page=2 |title=Frozen continent |last=Williams |first=George |date=29 March 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also points to the "notorious reluctance" of Australians to support Constitutional referendums: of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |1994 |p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seshat: Global History Databank''' is an international [[scientific research]] project of the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Evolution Institute]]. Founded in 2011, the [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''Seshat: Global History Databank''] gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a [[Digital humanities|digital storehouse]] for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

The Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of [[Cliodynamics]]. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the [[scientific method]] to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turchin |first=Peter |title= Arise cliodynamics |journal=Nature |date=2008 |doi= 10.1038/454034a |pmid=18596791 |volume=454 |issue=7200 |pages=34–35}} http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural evolutionary theory]] or [[Cultural evolutionism|cultural evolutionary theory]] to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.

== Project ==

The Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of [[social complexity]] in early civilizations, the creation of [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]] (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of [[ritual]] and [[religion]] in [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], the causes of [[economic growth]] and its consequences on individual's [[well-being]], and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge [[Semantic Web|digital technologies]] can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.

Several key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does [[prosocial behavior]] evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info|title=Seshat: Global History Databank - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late [[Neolithic]] (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30/|title=World Sample 30 - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Praise ===

[[Ian Morris (historian)]] recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

[[Gary Feinman]] also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Critics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process.

A '''ship's bell''' is used to indicate the time aboard a [[ship]] and hence to regulate the sailors' duty [[watch system|watch]]es.  The bell itself is usually made of brass or bronze, and normally has the ship's name engraved or cast on it.

==Strikes of the ship's bell==
===Timing of duty periods===
Unlike civil [[clock]] bells, the strikes of a ship's bell do not accord to the number of the hour. Instead, there are eight bells, one for each half-hour of a four-hour watch. In the age of sailing, watches were timed with a 30-minute hourglass. Bells would be struck every time the glass was turned, and in a pattern of pairs for easier counting, with any odd bells at the end of the sequence.

====Classical system====
The classical, or traditional, system was:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Naval Institute (1996) [1902]. The Bluejackets' Manual (24th |location= Annapolis, MD|isbn= 978-1591141532|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the crew of a ship would be divided into two to four groups, called [[watch system|watches]]. Each watch would take its turn with the essential activities of manning the helm, navigating, trimming sails, and keeping a lookout.

The hours between 16:00 and 20:00 are so arranged because that watch (the "[[dog watch]]") was divided in two. The odd number of watches aimed to give each man a different watch each day; it also allowed the entire crew of a vessel to eat an evening meal, the normal time being at 17:00 with first dog watchmen eating at 18:00.&lt;ref name=BHI /&gt;

===Other uses for bell strikes===

*Ship's bells are also used for safety in foggy conditions, their most important modern use.&lt;ref name="NMM"/&gt; 
*On US naval vessels, bells additionally are rung as "boat gongs" for officers and dignitaries coming aboard or leaving the ship, in a number equivalent to the number of [[sideboy]]s to which the visitor is entitled.&lt;ref&gt;www.seaflags.us/customs/trads.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*At midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], 16 bells would be struck&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; eight bells for the old year and eight bells for the new.
*When a sailor has died he or she can be honoured with the sounding of eight bells; meaning "end of the watch". The term "eight bells" can also be used in an [[obituary]], as a nautical [[euphemism]] for ''finished''.

==Name of the ship==
[[File:HMS Cavalier ship's bell.jpg|thumb|Ship's bell of {{HMS|Cavalier|R73|6}}]]
The ship's name is traditionally engraved or cast onto the surface of the bell, often with the year the ship was launched, as well. Occasionally (especially on more modern ships) the bell will also carry the name of the [[shipyard]] that built the ship. If a ship's name is changed, maritime tradition is that the original bell carrying the original name will remain with the vessel. A ship's bell is a prized possession when a ship is broken up&lt;ref name="NMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=EQA0482|title=Ship's Bell|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=2008-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209002216/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=EQA0482|archivedate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often provides the only positive means of identification in the case of a [[shipwreck]].

==Number of bells==

Most [[United States Navy]] ships of the post–World War II era have actually carried two ship's bells: the official bell on deck and a smaller one in the pilot house and at the quarterdeck at the [[1MC]] (public address) station, used when the ship is underway.

==Cook and boatswain==
According to seafaring legend, the ship's [[cook (profession)|cook]]s and [[Boatswain|boatswain's mates]] had a duty arrangement to give the cooks more sleep. The boatswain's mates, who worked 24 hours a day on [[watchstanding|watches]], would build the fire in the [[kitchen stove|stove]], so the cook could get up a little while later and the fire would be already going so he could begin preparing [[breakfast]]. In return, between meals, the cooks would shine the bell, which was traditionally the boatswain's mates' responsibility.

==Baptizing children==
It is a naval tradition to [[Baptism|baptize]] children using the ship's bell as a [[baptismal font]] and to engrave the names of the children on the bell afterwards. Christening information from the bells held by the [[CFB Esquimalt|Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt]] Museum has been entered into a searchable data archive.&lt;ref name=CFB&gt;{{cite web|title=The Christening Bells Project|url=http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/bells/bells.asp|website=CFB Esquimalt Naval &amp; Military Museum|accessdate=6 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230223824/http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/bells/bells.asp|archivedate=30 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">'''Social citizenship''' was a term first coined by [[T.H. Marshall]], who argued that the ideal citizenship experience entails access to political, civil and social rights in a state.&lt;ref name="Rummery"&gt;Rummery, Kirstein. (2002). "Disability, Citizenship and Community Care: A Case for Welfare Rights?" Hampshire: Ashgate publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marshall, social citizenship includes “the whole range from the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in society”.&lt;ref name="Beckett"&gt;Beckett, Angharad E. (2006). "Citizenship and Vulnerability: Disability and Issues of Social and Political Engagement". Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrove Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall’s concept of social policy has been critiqued by some scholars for being idealistic and only applicable to the participation of able-bodied white males.&lt;ref name="Borsay"&gt;Borsay, Anne. (2005). "Disability and Social Policy in Britain since 1750". Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrove Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Social Policy in Britain==
Under the [[Elizabethan Poor Law]], social rights were not part of citizenship status.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; The Poor Law Act of 1601 placed the responsibility of caring for the disabled on the family; the state was not legally obligated to care for those who were unable to work.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt; By the middle of the seventeenth century, small pensions were allocated to the poor, which often included disabled persons who were barred from wage labor, although these provisions were meager and not substantial enough to live off of.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt;

In 1834, the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] was created in order to reduce the number of able-bodied poor who received a pension.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt; While the disabled were able to access monetary assistance, they could only receive indoor assistance through institutionalization.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, Colin &amp; Mercer, Geof. (2010). "Exploring Disability". Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure of monetary provision stigmatized the disabled for their lack of participation in the labor force and ostracized them from the community, a result that reflects the cultural emphasis placed upon the ability and willingness to participate in the labor force.&lt;ref name="Borsay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

Beginning in the early 1900s, a “residual approach” to social policy was enacted in Britain where financial assistance would be provided to those without support at a minimal level in order to encourage active participation in the labor force.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Post-1945, additions were made to this social welfare approach that encompassed political-economic, social, and organizational reform.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;  Political-economic motivation emphasized reform encouraging high rates of employment, lower taxes, and minimal welfare dependents.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Social reform placed women, children, the elderly and the disabled as dependents of a male wage-earner which cast further distinctions between impaired and able-bodied citizens.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Finally, organizational reforms gave professionals increasing state support and decision making power in the realm of social services, especially in the case of health services.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Social Citizenship and the Disabled Today==
The current model of the welfare state, whereby social citizenship is obtained, encourages citizens to enter a “welfare market” in which they become consumers of welfare benefits, especially benefits linked to health and social care.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Beginning in 1979, the conservative administration led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] encouraged this model, arguing that market based access to social citizenship allows for the empowerment of citizens.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; This capitalist model, advocates claim, allows citizens to obtain full social citizenship by becoming “competent members of society,” which according to citizenship theorists Turner and Marshall is a key aspect of being a member of the state.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Whereas barred access to full social citizenship was combated by strengthening the private sector under Thatcher, the New Labour Government elected in 1997 focused on the expansion of public services in order to raise employment, and combat poverty.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Under the New Labour government, social inclusion became one of the primary rights of social citizenship in Britain.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Social inclusion is multifaceted and includes the right of a citizen to participate in society and the economy.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Relevant legislation==
The [[Disability Discrimination Act]] of 1995 was the first social policy created to prevent exclusion and discrimination in matters of the economy, though the act did not address prevalent inequalities in education and transportation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

In 2001, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) made discrimination against special needs students illegal and called for 'reasonable adjustments' to be made in order to ensure equal access to education, a crucial aspect of social citizenship.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

The Disability Equality Duty (DED) created in 2005 called for institutions to begin planning changes to infrastructure in order to further include people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

==Critiques of Social Rights==
Disability Rights movements in Europe have primarily been centered on making changes in social welfare policy.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Organizations advocating for disability rights in Britain have argued for the elimination of stereotypes that cast people with disabilities as vulnerable and in need of community care.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; In the current system, health and service providers have been in control of assessing the needs of the disabled.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt; Many disability rights organizations in Britain have pushed against this system in which the practitioner’s expertise takes precedence over the experience and assessment of the patient.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Biehal and colleagues have stated, “Many users of social services are excluded from full citizenship. Their right to treatment as equals may be limited by poverty, racism, assumptions about gender, age and disability”.&lt;ref name="Rummery"/&gt;

Policies created to ensure the social participation of British citizens with disabilities have been critiqued for not being strict enough. The 1995 Disability Discrimination Act has been accused of providing only limited protection as it did not include protection from discrimination in education or transportation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; In addition, 90% of employers were exempt from following the Act due to the fact that they had fewer than 20 employees.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; The policies that were designed to answer these critiques have also been accused of being inadequate as they are difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6283">The '''subjective theory of value''' is a [[theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] which advances the idea that the [[value (economics)|value]] of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends.&lt;ref&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''.  [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf p. 120]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern version of this theory was created independently and nearly simultaneously by [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[Léon Walras]], and [[Carl Menger]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="stigler"&gt;Stigler, George (1950) "The Development of Utility Theory. I" ''The Journal of Political Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to the subjective theory of value, voluntary [[trade]]s between individuals imply that both parties to the trade subjectively perceive the goods, labour or money they receive as being of higher value to the goods, labour or money they give away. The subjective-value theory holds that one can create value simply by transferring ownership of a thing to someone who values it more highly, without necessarily modifying that thing. Where wealth is understood to refer to individuals' subjective valuation of their possessions, voluntary trades may increase the total wealth in society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-mariotti/subjective-versus-objecti_b_880274.html Steve Mariotti, "Subjective Versus Objective Costs: How the Labor Theory of Value Almost Destroyed the World"] 06/20/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals will tend to obtain diminishing levels of satisfaction, or [[marginal utility]] from acquiring additional units of a good. They will initially prioritise obtaining the goods they most need, such as sufficient food, but once their need for food is satisfied up to a certain level, their desire for other goods will start to assume more relative importance, and they will seek to bring satisfaction of their need for food into satisfaction of their need for other goods.&lt;ref name="menger2"&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''. [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[free market]], [[competition]] between individuals seeking to trade goods they possess and services they can provide for goods they perceive as being of higher value to them results in a [[market equilibrium]] set of prices emerging. 

[[Classical economists]] such as [[David Ricardo]] believed that individual people obtain different levels of utility or 'value in use' from a service, but did not effectively connect those with market prices, or 'value in exchange', seeing them as separately derived from the quantity of labour input and other production factors.&lt;ref name="stigler" /&gt;  
 
Carl Menger argued that production was simply another case of the theory of marginal utility.&lt;ref name="stigler" /&gt; Labourers' wage-earning potential is set by the value of their work to others rather than subsistence costs, and they work because they value remuneration more highly than inactivity.&lt;ref name="menger"&gt;Menger, C. ''Principles of Economics''. [https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf pp. 169–73]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein disagreed saying, "The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of [society's] evil... The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid, both measured in terms of real value. In so far as the labor contract is "free," what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists' requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Why Socialism?|date=2018-03-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Why_Socialism%3F&amp;oldid=829021928|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diamond-water paradox ==
{{main|Paradox of value}}
The development of the subjective theory of value was partly motivated by the need to solve the value-paradox which had puzzled many classical economists. This paradox, also referred to descriptively as the diamond-water paradox, arose when value was attributed to things such as the amount of labor that went into the production of a good or alternatively to an objective measure of the usefulness of a good. The theory that it was the amount of labor that went into producing a good that determined its value proved equally futile because someone could stumble upon the discovery of a diamond while out for a hike, for example, which would require minimal labor, but yet the diamond could still be valued higher than water.

The subjective theory of value was able to solve this paradox by realizing that value is not determined by individuals choosing between entire abstract classes of goods, such as all the water in the world versus all the diamonds in the world. Rather an acting individual is faced with the choice between definite quantities of goods, and the choice made by such an actor is determined by which good of a specified quantity will satisfy the individual's highest subjectively ranked preference, or most desired end.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, Gene.

== Sustainable communities ==
Scotland's first dedicated programme for sustainable communities was delivered by Forward Scotland between 1997-1999 as part of a UK wide initiative led by Encams. Partnerships with a number of local authorities were developed and dedicated officers recruited to work with communities. This programme piloted the Community Eco-cal a forerunner of ecological footprinting. This programme was evaluated by Professor Michael Carley, Heriot-Watt University and the lessons learned informed a successor programme, 2000-2002, where community groups themselves were the focus. This produced the very first handbook for sustainable communities and a series of highly successful community projects. During this time the first community grants programme for sustainable communities was launched funded by the New Opportunities Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund). This programme funded some pioneering projects in areas such as community renewables, local food, community waste management and the first ecological footprinting projects in Scotland.

[[Community Energy Scotland]] is a charity that provides free advice, grant funding and finance for [[renewable energy]] projects developed by community groups in Scotland. The main aim of the company is to enable all communities to generate and use renewable energy for their long term and collective benefit.&lt;ref name=HICEC&gt;HICEC. (2006) ''Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company Annual Review''. Inverness. [http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-Annual_review.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the local [[development trust]] on the island of [[Tiree]] commissioned a 950&amp;nbsp;kW community-owned wind turbine project, the fourth such large-scale project in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tireerenewableenergy.co.uk/ "Tiree renewable energy"]. tireerenewableenergy.co.uk.

==Public sector==

===Government policy===
The first serious policy was written in 1998 in anticipation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, by the Secretary of State's Advisory Group for Sustainable Development. This was followed by strategy that focussed on Waste, Energy and Travel in 2002 and Choosing our Future in 2005, which was written in association with the UK shared framework for sustainable development. In 2007 the Scottish National Party took office in a minority government pursuing 5 strategic objectives that encompass sustainable development but do not specifically reference it. Instead the government has adopted sustainable economic growth as its principal target.

In June 2007 [[John Swinney]], the new Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in the [[Scottish Government]], announced plans for a Climate Change Bill that would include an intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Kevin (22 June 2007). [http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.1490712.0.0.php "Scotland could be ‘world leader’ in fighting climate change".] Glasgow. ''The Herald''.

In August 2007 the Scottish Government announced the creation of a [[Saltire Prize]] for innovation in industry, which will reward excellence in developing new renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi-energy.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-%20%20%2006gnew02i%20%20%20.RefLocID-06g008001.Lang-EN.htm "Green energy excellence to be rewarded": John Swinney announces Saltire Prize] Hi-Energy (15 August 2007) Press release.

The passage of the [[Climate change in Scotland#Mitigation|Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009]] has a created and informed a wide variety of initiatives. The Climate Change Delivery Plan sets out what needs to be done to achieve emissions reductions to meet the statutory targets that are included in the Act. The Climate Change Adaptation Framework, published in December 2009  aims to build resilience and capacity for change. Other public sector initiatives  include:
* The Renewable Energy Framework, the Renewables Action Plan, and the Renewable Heat Action Plan
* The [[Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009]]
* Scotland's Climate Change Declaration
* The Rural Land Use Study
* The Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership

===Scottish Sustainable Development Forum===
The Scottish Sustainable Development Forum (SSDF) is a group the focussed on promoting debate and action on sustainable development issues in Scotland. Forum membership is open to any individual who wishes to make Scotland more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssdforum.org.uk/ "About Us"] Scottish Sustainable Development Forum. Retrieved 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies===
In January 2010 it emerged that [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], the government body responsible for protecting the environment had failed to reach its carbon emissions targets. Its aim is to cut CO2 emissions from business activities by 25% by 2012 compared with 2006 but a report showed that they had risen by 10% in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Fyall, Jenny (29 January 2010) '' 'Green police' fail to hit own targets".''The Scotsman''.

==Energy production and distribution==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Scotland}}
[[File:Windmills and Ailsa Craig aka Paddy's Milestone rotated.jpg|thumb|right|Wind, wave and tide make up more than 80% of Scotland's renewable energy potential.]]
The natural resource base for [[renewable energy|renewables]] is extraordinary by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards. In addition to an existing installed capacity{{Ref label|A|a|none}} of 1.3 [[watt|Gigawatts]] (GW) of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of [[wind power|wind]] and 7.5 GW of [[tidal power]], 25% of the estimated total capacity for the [[European Union]] and up to 14 GW of [[wave power]] potential, 10% of EU capacity.&lt;ref name=Pow&gt;RSPB Scotland, WWF Scotland and FOE Scotland (February 2006) ''The Power of Scotland: Cutting Carbon with Scotland's Renewable Energy''. RSPB et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SER/&gt; The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW.&lt;ref name=Pow/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRF4&gt;Scottish Renewables (January 2006) ''Market and Planning Report''. Issue No 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this potential remains untapped, but continuing improvements in engineering are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be utilised. Fears regarding "[[peak oil]]" and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various [[biofuel]]s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on [[subsidy|subsidies]], it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;Monbiot, George (2006) ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning''. London. Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned increases in both large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] are being researched.&lt;ref name=BPPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterheadhydrogenpower.com/|title=Peterhead hydrogen project|publisher=[[BP]]|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.&lt;ref&gt;HICEC.

===Wind power===
{{Main|Wind power in Scotland}}
Wind power in Scotland is an area of considerable activity, with 1550 MW of installed capacity as at October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7695508.stm Turbines achieve energy landmark]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] is the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland and the world's largest [[wind turbine]] generator (5 MW) is currently undergoing testing in the North Sea, 15 miles off the east coast. There are numerous large wind farms as well as a number, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership. The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland. There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore, given the high average wind speeds.

In May 2008 Scottish and Southern Energy confirmed it was proceeding with the Greater Gabbard wind farm, located off the south coast of England. However, they sold their stake in this project, expected to become the largest wind farm in the world, to [[npower (UK)|Npower]] some six months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52579 "Greater Gabbard Wind Project Gets Go-ahead "] (27 May 2008) Renewable Energy World.com.

===Lower carbon power stations===
In May 2007 Scottish Power announced that Alstom Power and Doosan Babcock had been commissioned to design plans for "clean coal" technology at [[Longannet]] and [[Cockenzie power station|Cockenzie]] power stations. This would have become the largest project of its kind in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Alistair (18 May 2007). [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=771022007 " 'Dinosaur' power stations in line for £1bn green revamp"]. Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cancelled in 2011 after the Westminster Government withdrew funding.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Brian (19 Oct 2011) "Scots £1bn climate change plant is axed". Glasgow. ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Power]] have also announced that they wished to reduce carbon emissions by using biomass products such as willow or cereals at Longannet and Cockenzie. This could save up to 300,000 tonnes (330,000&amp;nbsp;tons) of carbon emissions per annum. However, the challenge of replacing large-scale power production with renewables was highlighted by the fact that to replace 5% of the fuel from these plants, fully 12% of Scotland's agricultural land would be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6905893.stm "Crop energy power plan unveiled".] BBC online (July 19, 2007). Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sequestration===
The [[British Geological Survey]] estimate that potentially 755 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be stored in [[carbon dioxide sink]]s in the [[North Sea]] (Scotland's annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output is circa 50 million tonnes). The process also aids the recovery of oil and gas as it increases pressure in the oil field. The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] estimate that as much as 2 billion additional barrels of oil could be recovered as a result of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection.&lt;ref name=SER&gt;''A Scottish Energy Review''. (November 2005) Scottish National Party Framework Paper. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this process could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from conventional power plants by as much as 80–90%, if combined with increased oil recovery the net savings in carbon emissions may be much less as the total volume of oil and gas used from that field would increase.&lt;ref name=Monbiot /&gt;

===Electricity distribution===
However, controversy has arisen about [[Ofgem]]'s proposed plans to increase transmission charges for distant electrical generation. This was widely seen as placing renewable energy production in Scotland at a considerable disadvantage. Jason Ormiston, the chief executive of [[Scottish Renewables]] was quoted as saying "At a time when the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, here we have the industry regulator penalising renewable electricity generators for generating where the resource is greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ian (27 July 2007).

Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was highlighted the following month when leaked Department of Trade and Industry documents indicated that, despite Scottish successes, under current policies Britain would miss the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy "Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target".] London. ''Guardian Unlimited'' (13 August 2007). Retrieved on 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month a report by [[Xero Energy Limited]] into these 'use of system' transmission charges across Europe indicated that the UK system creates costs that are up to thirty times higher in Scotland than elsewhere in Europe and that charges for the [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]] are "almost certainly higher than any other European country". [[Rob Gibson]] an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for the Highlands and Islands described the charges as "a tax on geography", and Elaine Hanton of [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|HIE]] claimed the report raised "serious concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John (14 September 2007) "Green energy in Highlands being hampered by 'tax on geography' ".

===Hydrogen economy===
An innovative approach was proposed by [[BP]] in partnership with [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] for the creation of a hydrogen-based power station at [[Peterhead]]. The project would have taken natural gas extracted from the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], [[cracking (chemistry)|crack]] the gas to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and burn the hydrogen as the fuel source to create electricity in a 475 MW power station. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would then have been returned to the Miller field reservoir more than {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} under the seabed in a process called carbon sequestration (see above). The scheme was expected to be in production by 2009 at a projected cost of $600&amp;nbsp;million, although it fell through as it failed to gain sufficient support from the UK government to enable this to occur. Had it been completed, the plant would have been the first industrial-scale, hydrogen power station in the world.&lt;ref name=BPPH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are ongoing attempts to keep the project alive—see for example Perry, David (25 May 2007) "Last-ditch fight on to save green gas project". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 a joint venture was announced by the PURE Energy Centre and the Hjaltland Housing Association to create two “unplugged” hydrogen houses on a remote site in Eshaness, [[Northmavine]], in [[Shetland]]. The installation will involve two combined heat and power systems, wind turbines and a hydrogen fuel cell to heat the houses at times when the wind is not blowing. There is also the possibility of a hydrogen refuelling station 
at the site for hydrogen-powered cars. A spokesman for PURE said “Forty per cent of the world-wide population lives with no access to 
electricity and heat. The CHP scheme will provide these populations with such access. There will be no impact on the environment whatsoever. This is totally clean energy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-News-Oct07.pdf "‘Unplugged Houses’ at Northmavine"] (pdf) (October 2007) ''Community Energy News No 6''. Dingwall. HICEC.

In 2013 [[Baron Wallace of Tankerness]] sided with liquidators [[KPMG]] who are arguing UK insolvency law has precedence over  Scottish environmental regulations. Wallace's position, taken "on behalf of the UK Government" is that the liquidators have the power to abandon environmental clean-up costs after the company with the responsibility for them has gone bust. KPMG estimates the liquidation of Scottish Coal will leave up to £30m that would be paid to creditor [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] rather go towards the restoration of disused mines in [[Ayrshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]].

A play-off structure involving the top five teams was used to determine the winners of the [[Super League]] competition in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[rugby league]] from 1998 until 2001. A [[Top six play-offs|top six play-off]] system was then introduced. Apart from the Grand Final all matches are staged at the home ground of the team placed higher in the final league table.

The same system was used in the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]]'s Sydney Competition 1973–1994, the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] in its only season 1997, the [[Australian Football League|VFL]], 1972–1990 and [[New Zealand Rugby League|New Zealand's]] [[Lion Red Cup]], 1994–1996, and [[Bartercard Cup]], 2000–2006.

From week two on the Top five play-offs system reflects exactly the [[Page playoff system]].

==How it works==
'''Week One'''

* Qualification Final: 2nd vs 3rd
* Elimination Final: 4th vs 5th
* Bye: 1st

'''Week Two'''

* Major Semi Final: 1st vs Winners of Qualification Final
* Minor Semi Final: Losers of Qualification Final vs Winners of Elimination Final

'''Week Three'''

* Preliminary Final: Losers of Major Semi Final vs Winners of Minor Semi Final
* Bye: Winners of Major Semi Final

'''Week Four'''

* Grand Final: Winners of Major Semi Final vs Winners of Preliminary Final

This is considered a good playoff system, as while it allows fifth place to take part, it is incredibly difficult for them to be crowned champions as they must beat every team from above them at some point.

The only NSWRL team to win the premiership from 5th was Brisbane in 1993.

In elite Australian Rules Football, the only team to win from fifth under this system was Norwood in the SANFL in 1984. No AFL/VFL team won from fifth under this format (1972&amp;ndash;1990), and no WAFL team has won under this format as of 2016.

If all matches have the same odds to win, then Seed 1 has 37.5% to be champion; Seed 2 and 3 have 25% to be champion; Seed 4 and 5 have 6.25%

Seed 1 has two chances to reach the final, and only needs to win 1 match to clinch it. It is only eliminated before the final if loses against both finalists, and doesn´t win any match

Seed 2 and 3 need to win 2 out of 3 matches to reach the final (they are like in a best-of-3 semi-final, but with different opponents in any round)

Seed 4 and 5 need to win all other 4 opponents without loss to be crowned. Any loss means its elimination

==Example==

'''Tri-Stat dX''' is a [[Generic role-playing game system|generic]] [[role-playing game]] system developed and published by [[Guardians of Order]] in 2003. Like other [[generic role-playing game system]]s, Tri-Stat dX has adaptable rules that can be applied to many genres and settings.

Tri-Stat dX's name comes from the system's three main Stats: '''Mind''', '''Body''' and '''Soul'''. "dX" refers to the [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[dice]] used in the game: any of the available die types may be used.

It is based on the original Tri-Stat System first introduced in 1999 with the popular ''[[Big Eyes, Small Mouth]]'' ''(BESM)'' [[anime]]-genre RPG (which used d6 dice), which is now published by [[White Wolf Publishing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.white-wolf.com/besm/ White Wolf Publishing, Big Eyes, Small Mouth]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512051548/http://www.white-wolf.com/besm/ |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[superhero]]-genre RPG ''[[Silver Age Sentinels]]'' (which used d10 dice), and now includes a number of related systems and games such as ''[[Ex Machina (role-playing game)|Ex Machina]]'', ''Dreaming Cities'', and ''[[Tékumel: Empire of the Petal Throne|Tekumel]]'' (which uses a variation of the system).

The core rules for the Tri-Stat dX system were once available as a free download from the Guardians of Order website, which is now defunct. Although White Wolf has acquired the publishing rights for ''BESM'', they have not offered continued support for the Tri-Stat dX system. The rules however are still available on DriveThruRPG&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/368/TriStat-dX-Core-System-RolePlaying-Game/ Tri-Stat dX]&lt;/ref&gt; at no cost.

==Making Tri-Stat characters==
Since all mechanics in Tri-Stat dX use two dice of the same die type (2d6, 2d10, 2d20 etc.), the first choice a [[Game Master]] (GM) must decide the game's '''Power Level''', and thus what type of polyhedral dice to use in their game.

Tri-Stat uses one table of '''Stat Values''' which range from 1 (Inept) to 40 (Godlike). The "human norm" is considered 4. The bigger the die type used in the game, the more powerful the characters generally are, and achieve Stat Values much higher than the human norm. Playing in a "mundane" (real-world) setting, the GM would set the die type to 2d4, and only allow characters to achieve maximum unadjusted die roll totals of 8. A typical "action-adventure" would use a 2d6, allowing more heroic characters and unadjusted rolls up to 12. Games with [[transhuman]] characters would use 2d8, and allow rolls up to 16. Superhero games would use 2d10, or 2d12. Godlike characters would use 2d20.

===Character Points===
Characters in Tri-Stat are built with '''Character Points'''. To help keep characters "balanced", each player is given the same number of Character Points. Depending on the setting's Power Level (and die type chosen by the GM), the GM assigns a number of Character Points to each player to spend on Stats and other abilities. In a "Subhuman" mundane world, the characters have 25 - 50 points. In an "Action-Adventure" setting, characters get 50 - 70 points and so on. Godlike characters could have 300+ Character Points.

===Stats===
Characters in Tri-Stat have three main '''Stats''':
* '''Body''': a measure of the character's physical prowess and health.
* '''Mind''': a measure of the character's mental capacity and intelligence.
* '''Soul''': a measure of the character's spirit and willpower.

Typical Stats range in levels from 1 to 20, although the Stats can go higher depending on the Power Level of the game. Levels of Stats are purchased with Character Points. All Stats cost two Character Points per level, requiring a minimum expenditure of two points per Stat. (Example: Having a Mind Stat of 6 would cost 12 points, two points each for the six stat points). An optional rule the GM can impose increases the point cost for Stats at incremental levels, so that high level Stats require more points to be increased to the next level.

===Derived values===
'''Derived Values''' are determined by mathematical formulas based on the values of the character's Stats.
* '''Attack Combat Value''': ('''ACV''') [(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3] which is the focus of all the character's Stats to determine their bonus to Hit an opponent during combat scenes.
* '''Defense Combat Value''': ('''DCV''') [(Body + Mind + Soul) / 3 - 2] which is the character's ability to react against incoming attacks.
* '''Health Points''': [(Body + Soul) × 5] which is the amount of damage a character can withstand before they are knocked unconscious or killed. These are similar to [[hit points]] in other games.

'''Optional derived values:'''
* '''Energy Points''': [(Mind + Soul) × 5] an optional Stat used for fueling certain superpower Attributes. When a character runs out of Energy Points, they can no longer use that power.
* '''Shock Value''': [(Health Points) / 5] for more "realistic" combat scenes, when a character suffers their Shock Value in damage, there is a chance they can become stunned.

===Attributes===
Any Character Points left over from buying Stat levels are used to buy '''Attributes''' for the character. Attributes represent special talents, perks and superpower abilities a character may have. (With them, characters can fly, cast spells, bend iron bars, etc.). Not all campaigns require a character to have superpowers, so a GM can decide which Attributes will be allowed in their game and which ones will not. Because some Attributes (like Special Attacks, Organizational Ties, Gadgets, Henchmen, and Highly Skilled) are similar to [[GURPS]] [[advantage (role-playing games)|advantages]] and [[d20 System]] Feats, at least some Attributes will be available to characters regardless of the setting.

Tri-Stat has many kinds of Attributes available to choose from. Each Attribute costs a certain amount of Character Points to purchase a '''Rank Level''' in that ability. The costs of an Attribute Level depends on what it can do for the character. Certain Attributes can be modified by '''Power Modifier Values''' ('''PMVs''') (which can increase, ''e.g.'', a power's area of effect, duration, range, or number of targets, also increasing the point cost of the Attribute per Rank&lt;!-- thus similar to GURPS enhancements--&gt;).

===Defects===
'''Defects''' are the opposite of Attributes, and represent some kind of flaw or weakness in the character. By selecting Defects, a player can regain Character Points to spend elsewhere. There are many Defects available and each returns an amount of Character Points based on the severity of how much they hinder the character. An Attribute can also be assigned a Defect which brings the cost of the power down. For instance, a beam weapon superpower could require a character's special concentration to maintain, giving an advantage to an enemy force. A Personality Defect could be a [[mental illness]] the character suffers from, such as [[paranoia]], [[delusion]]s, or [[schizophrenia]]; or could be simply a character flaw, such as being completely obnoxious and difficult for others to deal with.

===Skills===
'''Skills''' represent special areas of mental knowledge or technique a character may excel in. Like most games that use Skills, Tri-Stat has a comprehensive Skill list of subjects useful to characters. Of course, players and the GM may add Skills of their devising into the game system if needed. Depending on the campaign setting, certain Skills may or may not be available. For instance, in a [[Medieval]] fantasy setting, skills for computers would not be available. Each Skill is also tied to one (or more) of the character's three Stats. Mechanics, for example, is tied to both the Body and Mind Stat. Which one, depends on how the GM feels the character is using it.

Skills are organized as either General or Combat Skills, and are purchased by '''Skill Points''' that are separate from Character Points. A character's starting amount of Skill Points and maximum '''Skill Level''' is determined by the campaign's Power Level. For example, in a "Subhuman" game, characters get 10 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 2. In a "Godlike" campaign, characters get 60 Skill Points and can have a maximum Skill Level of 10. Certain Attributes can give characters more or fewer Skill Points as they choose. A character's level in a Skill determines how well they are at performing it. At Skill level 1 they are "well trained", and at 10 they are "heavenly masters" of it.

The Skill Point cost of a Skill depends on the particular Skill and the campaign setting it is being used in. Unlike many other games, skill cost is not based on its real world difficulty to learn.  Instead, skill cost is based on its utility in a given setting.  More useful skills cost more.  Thus, in a mystery setting, investigative skills would be very expensive, while in a medieval martial arts setting those same investigative skills would be cheap to acquire.

Skills are available with '''Specializations''' that subdivide a particular area of knowledge into specific Skills a character is adept at. For instance, if picking the Artisan Skill, a character could Specialize in "Woodworking" or "Plumbing" among others. Specializations only cost one Skill Point to acquire no matter the setting. For example, a character could pick Gun Combat in a modern day setting, and pay 8 Skill Points for 1 level of Gun Combat, and pay one Skill Point to Specialize in pistol (Level 2). When using other kinds of firearms their effective Level is 1, but with a pistol it would be Level 2.

==Overview of game mechanics==
All die roll resolutions in Tri-Stat use two polyhedral dice of the same type. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, these die types will be different. For "mundane" settings, 2d4 is used; for "heroic-action" settings 2d6 is used; for "post-human" settings 2d8 is used; for "superhero" games 2d10 or 2d12 can be used; and for "Godlike" settings, 2d20 is used. The task resolution mechanic is similar to the method used in [[GURPS]], where rolling lower than the target number is a success and rolling over it is a failure.

===Task resolutions===
Whenever a character needs to roll dice to see if they succeeded or failed at doing something, they must make a dice roll which randomly determines success or failure. There are three kinds of checks in Tri-Stat, '''Stat Checks''', '''Skill Checks''' and '''Contested Checks'''. Stat Checks are made when the GM feels a check of a character's innate ability is required rather than a specific Skill. Skill Checks are made when a particular area of the character's expertise is being challenged. Contested Checks are made against the actions of another character, or non-player character (NPC), that is challenging the character, and is rolled against what that opponent does.

Stat Checks and Skill Checks are often altered by a '''Difficulty Modifier''' as determined by the GM. The Difficulty Modifier is added to the target number (usually the player's relevant Stat score) thus making rolling under the target number harder or easier. Modifier ranges depend on the type of die being used in the game. For instance, when using 2d6, Difficulty Modifiers range from +6 "really easy" to -6 "really hard". For 2d20, something really easy would be +20 and really difficult is -20. In all cases, average difficulty is set at zero, or no modification.

When making a Stat Check, a player must roll a total, with two dice, that is less than or equal to the value of the character's Stat. For example, making a check to open a heavy door, a player must roll equal to or less than the numerical level of the character's Body Stat. If the roll was higher, the character has failed at the task.

When making a Skill Check, the player selects the particular Skill being challenged and adds the Skill's numerical level as a bonus to the Stat it is tied to. The player must roll less than or equal to the modified Stat Check to succeed the task. Like a Stat Check, a higher roll is a failure. Often a GM may decide a particular task requires at least one level in a specific Skill, otherwise the character cannot perform the task or must do so as an Unskilled Check, where depending on the general familiarity of the situation, the GM adds in or subtracts Modifiers for the action.

When directly challenged by another character or NPC, a player makes Stat and Skill checks as normal, but the results must be greater than the opposition's results to succeed. GMs may levy Difficulty Modifiers for favorable or unfavorable circumstance as they see fit, if the particular challenger is at an advantage, or disadvantage during the contest.

===Combat scenes===
Time in Tri-Stat is measured in '''Rounds''' which represent about 5 seconds of real time. Rounds are linked together in '''Scenes'''. A Scene changes when the specific events and places happen to change in the game. For example, a brawl Scene in a bar would change if the fight is moved out to the parking lot. During a Round, a character can take one of several kinds of '''Actions''', such as Move, Attack, or Defend.

Combat can be seen as a bunch of contested actions made against particular adversaries, however the character uses their Attack Combat Value as the number they must roll equal to, or less than, to score successful attacks against the opposition. Their ACV can be modified by Combat Skills, like Gun Combat, and any Specializations with a particular weapon to score a better hit against the target. Characters roll for '''Initiative''' (2 dice + ACV), during a Round of combat to see who goes first. The higher roll "Gains Initiative" and allows the character to either take action first, or hold and wait to see what their opponent does.

Defenders of attacks roll their Defense Combat Value to see if they defend against an incoming attack. If they roll less than or equal to their DCV, they successfully defend against the attack whether or not the attacker succeeded his ACV or not. A failed Defense roll means the attack got through and the target takes damage.

===Resolving damage===
Characters can take damage from either suffering an injury or from an attack in combat. Each attack has a '''Maximum Damage Rating''' ('''MDR'''), which is the total amount of damage points a particular weapon or accident situation can inflict upon the victim. When an attack makes it through a defense, the defender takes damage from the attack. Depending on the Power Level of the campaign, the damage is rolled with 2 dice and consulted on a '''Damage Percentage Table'''. The particular roll will indicate that the target took 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the attack's MDR. The attacker's Attack Combat Value is fully added to the resulting percentage of MDR to determine the total amount of damage inflicted upon the target. Damage is then deducted from a character or object's Health Points.

There are also optional damage rules, like a BESM-like approach where attacks always deal 100% damage (although 75% would be closer to the BESM damage increments) or the damage system from ''[[Hong Kong Action Theatre!]]'', where the margin of success of both attacker and defender determines whether the attack deals 100% damage, 50% damage, or completely misses.

'''Critical Hits''' are inflicted whenever an attack die roll comes up as a 2. The attacker automatically hits the target (who cannot defend against it). The target then suffers double the MDR of the weapon plus the attacker's ACV in damage.

If a character loses all their Health Points, they fall unconscious and are dying. If their Health Points drop to the full negative amount of their Health Points they die. For instance, a character who has 25 Health Points dies when their Health Points reach −25.

===Rewards===
Game Masters reward Tri-Stat characters with '''Advancement Points''', which the players can use to purchase better levels of Stats, Skills and Attributes.

Vulnerability is mainly caused by [[habitat loss]] or destruction of the species home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], an example being the [[military macaw]].

There are currently 5196 [[animal]]s and 6789 [[plant]]s classified as vulnerable, compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222, respectively.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf | title = IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EX, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List | accessdate = 2012-12-31 | author = [[IUCN]] | date = 2012 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Practices such as [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically.

==Criteria==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] uses several criteria to enter species in this category. A [[taxon]] is Vulnerable when it is not [[critically endangered]] or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future, as defined by any of the following criteria (A to E):

'''A) Population reduction in the form of either of the following:'''

#An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of ≥ 50% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, provided the causes of the reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased.&lt;ref name=iucnvu&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#critical&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement is based on (and specifying) any of the following:
##direct observation
##an index of abundance appropriate for the taxon
##a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence or quality of habitat
##actual or potential levels of exploitation
##the effects of [[Introduced species|introduced taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], pathogens, [[pollutants]], competitors or [[parasites]].
#A reduction of at least 20%, projected or suspected to be met within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of (2), (3), (4) or (5) above.

'''B) Extent of occurrence estimated to be less than 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or area of occupancy estimated to be less than 2000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and estimates indicating any two of the following:
'''

#Severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than ten locations.
#Continuing decline, inferred, observed or projected, in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##area, extent or quality of habitat
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals
#Extreme fluctuations in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals

'''C) Population estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and either:'''

#An estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer, or
#A continuing decline, observed, projected, or inferred, in numbers of mature individuals and population structure in the form of either:
##severely fragmented (i.e. no subpopulation estimated to contain more than 1000 mature individuals)
##all mature individuals are in a single subpopulation

'''D) Population very small or restricted in the form of either of the following:'''

#Population estimated to number less than 1000 mature individuals.
#Population is characterised by an acute restriction in its area of occupancy (typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name=iucnvu /&gt; or in the number of locations (typically less than five). Such a taxon would thus be prone to the effects of human activities (or stochastic events whose impact is increased by human activities) within a very short period of time in an unforeseeable future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short period.

'''E) Quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 10% within 100 years.'''

The examples of vulnerable animal species are [[hyacinth macaw]], [[mountain zebra]], [[gaur]], [[kea]], [[black crowned crane]] and [[blue crane]]
