{{Reading}}
According to the '''alphabetic principle''', [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and combinations of letters are the [[symbol]]s used to represent the [[phoneme|speech sounds]] of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words. The alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the [[English (language)|English]] variety of the [[Roman alphabet]]), which is one of the more common types of [[List of writing systems|writing systems]] in use today.

Alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them. Such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Such languages have a straightforward [[spelling]] system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its [[pronunciation]] and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. Ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include [[Avestan alphabet|Avestic]], [[Latin]], [[Tamil script|Tamil]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]], and [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanāgarī]]— an [[abugida]]; see [[Vyakarana]]). On the other hand, [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.

The alphabetic principle does not underlie [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] like [[written Chinese|Chinese]] or [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]. [[Korean Language|Korean]], along with Chinese and Japanese, is a member of the [[CJK characters|CJK group]] and shares origins for many of the symbols. [[Hangul]], the Korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

==Latin alphabet==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
Most [[orthographies]] that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]] are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent. This is because the ancient Romans designed the alphabet specifically for Latin. In the Middle Ages, it was adapted to the Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin, as well as to the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some Slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of Europe.

===English orthography===

{{Main|English orthography}}
[[English orthography]] is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made English spelling patterns confusing. Spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, Sebastian. Exception Words, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Retrieved from http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183306/http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters ''ee'' almost always represent {{IPA|/i/}}, but the sound can also be represented by the letter ''y'' or the letters ''ie''.

The spelling systems for some languages, such as [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. In [[English orthography|English]] the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern. There are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the English language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, English spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, English frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.

==Role in beginning reading==
{{See also|Phonics|Whole Language}}
Learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades. Understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word. Typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out. Similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Juel | first1 = Connie | title = Handbook of Reading Research, II | chapter = 27 Beginning Reading | volume = 2 |pages=759–788 | editor = Rebecca Barr | editor2 = Michael L.

Two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in English. Proponents of [[phonics]] argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to [[automaticity]], in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chall |first=Jeanne S. |authorlink=Jeanne Chall |date=1996 | edition=3rd |title=Learning to read: The great debate |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/learning-to-read-the-great-debate/oclc/8974797/editions  | page= |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |access-date=2010-07-01 | quote= }} '''[See [[Talk: Alphabetic principle#Chall| Talk page]]&amp;zwj;]'''&lt;/ref&gt;   
Others, including advocates of [[Whole language|whole-language]] who hold that reading should be taught [[Holistic education|holistically]], assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

&lt;!--Deleted text: The alphabetic principle is that, in such writing systems, each [[grapheme]] (contextually) represented a [[phoneme]] at the time and place of its [[orthography|orthographic]] inception or last change. ... , where one written word may have several readings and one spoken word may have several writings. The principle is generally not applied to a [[syllabary]] like [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]], because of the huge amount of [[syllable]]s possible compared to [[phone]]s.
Due to [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] change and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] geographical and sociocultural differences, there is, by definition, no standardised alphabet that renders the spoken language truthfully (and vice versa). [[Literal language]] is always more uniform than [[oral language]].--&gt;

==Evolution and use==
In medieval Armenian culture, the eternity sign symbolized the concept of everlasting, celestial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer-Manndorff|first=Elisabeth|title=Armenia: Past and Present|year=1981|publisher=Reich Verlag|page=89|quote=The circle, as a line returning upon itself, represented perfection.

Sahakyan/ Armenian Highland: / RAU Press. 2006, page 150(349)&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 8th century the use of the Armenian symbol of eternity had become a long established national iconographical practice,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob G.

In 2010 the Armenian National Institute of Standards suggested encoding an Armenian Eternity sign in the [[Unicode]] character set,&lt;ref name=SARM&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenian Eternity Sign|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10372-n3921.pdf|publisher=[[Unicode]]|pages=10–12|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both right-facing and left-facing Armenian eternity signs were included in Unicode version 7.0 when it was released in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicode: Armenian|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-7.0/U70-0530.pdf|accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], '''Ascended Masters''' are believed to be spiritually [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] beings who in past [[incarnation]]s were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]].

Both "[[Mahātmā#Theosophy|Mahatma]]" and "Ascended Master" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] concept of the Mahatma or [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]. However, Mahatmas and Ascended Masters are believed by some to differ in certain respects.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, a "Master", "Commoner", "Shaman", or "Spiritual Master" is a human being who has taken the Fifth Initiation and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 5th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has taken the Sixth Initiation, also referred to as Ascension,&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2004. Describes the Theosophical Society and religious organizations based on a belief in Ascended Masters, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pp. 330–334.&lt;/ref&gt; and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 6th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence." When a human being has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence," that state of full union is referred to as "Ascension." Technically, a human being "ascends" when he takes the Sixth Initiation, and not before then.

A "Chohan" (Lord) of a "Ray" is an Ascended Master who has been placed in charge of one of the 12 "Rays" (until recently, 7 Rays were generally known, and 5 Rays were "secret"), due to having an extraordinary natural spiritual affinity for that Ray. A "Ray" is a concentrated stream of spiritual energy emanating, ultimately, from the Godhead. Each "Ray" is the embodiment/expression of one of the 12 great God-Qualities, such as Divine Will, Divine Wisdom, Divine Love, etc. The "Chohans (Lords) of the Rays" thus constitute a special grouping of Ascended Masters (Sixth Level Initiates).

Those who have taken the Seventh Initiation hold the Senior Administrative Posts in the [[Great White Brotherhood]] on Earth. These senior administrative posts are divided into 3 departments: The Department of the Manu, the Department of the Planetary Christ, and the Department of the Mahachohan. "

A "Lord of the World" is a human being (or another organism) who has taken the Ninth Initiation. According to ascended master teaching, The Ninth Initiation is the highest Initiation possible on, what is believed to be a 9d-dimensional planet grid such as Earth by Ascended Master Teaching believers. They believe this will be until the end of [[2012 phenomenon|21 December, 2012]]. [[Sanat Kumara]] (a "Lord of the Flame" originally from the higher-dimensional levels of the planet Venus) was the original being who held the spiritual office of "Lord of the World"  here on planet Earth.

The term "Ascended Master" was first used by [[Baird T. Spalding]] in 1924 in his series of books, "The Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East" (DeVorss and Co.). Godfre Ray King further popularized this concept of spiritual masters who had once lived on the earth in his book ''Unveiled Mysteries'' &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 1934, p. vii: "The time has arrived, when the Great Wisdom, held and guarded for many centuries in the Far East, is now to come forth in America, at the command of those Great Ascended Masters who direct and protect the evolution of mankind upon this Earth."&lt;/ref&gt; (1934) by [[Guy Ballard]] (1878-1939). Ballard was the founder of the first "Ascended Master Teaching" in modern times, known as The [["I AM" Activity]] (in full: The "I AM" Religious Activity of the Saint Germain Foundation ).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings were continued and embellished by later organizations such as [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;ref name="Freedom Journal 1961"&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' (1951-1961) Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1951) (known in the 1980s as The New Age Church of the Christ, and later as The Bridge to Spiritual Freedom), [[The Summit Lighthouse]]&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1958) and its successor organization the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and various other organizations such as the [[White Eagle Lodge]] (1936).&lt;ref name="Braden, Charles S. 2000, pp. 257-307"&gt;[[Charles S. Braden|Braden, Charles S.]] ''These Also Believe'', MacMillan Publishing Company 2000, pp. 257–307.&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern form of the teachings, which did not rely on "channeled" messages, was given by a former associate of Godfre Ray King, Pearl Dorris, in Mount Shasta, California, beginning on October 20, 1972 and continuing until her death in Yreka, California in 1990 (See her biography: ''Lady Master Pearl, My Teacher'' by Peter Mt. Shasta, also the book she helped channel, ''Step by Step: Ascended Master Discourses''). Her emphasis was on learning to feel and identify  with the I AM Presence within, rather than invoking the "Presence" as an external mental principle. Under her tutelage, [[Peter Mt. Shasta]] was trained to continue the Masters' teachings, working today to incorporate the inner teachings of the Far East and their emphasis on self-observation, with the dynamic I AM teachings that uses affirmations to develop mastery in daily life. See ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. In [[Peter Mt. Shasta]]'s third autobiographical book ''My Search in Tibet for the Secret Wish-Fulfilling Jewel'' he mentions the widely held belief in Tibet that yogis ascend, ''jalus'' (Tibetan), by dissolving the five elements and raising the Nirmanakaya and Sambogakaya bodies into the Dharmakaya (known also as Atman, Monad, or I AM Presence).

The rays, the divine evolutions of peoples and planets are represented by 7 colors (new age) and more 5 colors (new age gold or solar rays). The colors of new age and solar rays are (in order): 1 blue (power of faith); 2 yellow (obedience); 3 pink (beauty; geniality); 4 white (ascension; peace; light); 5 green (nature); 6 red (true resurrection); 7 violet (New Age of Master Saint Germain); 8 turquoise (lucidity); 9 magenta (divine wonder; justiciars); 10 gold (materialization of wealth); 11 orange (sunshine); 12 Opaline (renewal).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Definition==
Students of Ascended Master Teachings organizations (also known as Ascended Master Activities) believe that the Presence of Life — God — individualizes as "Mighty I AM Presences," which then incarnate in lower-dimensional subtle and gross bodies throughout the created universes. They believe that their Teachings have been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have lived in physical bodies, acquired the Wisdom and Mastery needed to become Immortal and Free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, and have attained their "Ascension" (the Sixth Initiation). They consider the Ascension to be the complete permanent union of the raised and purified outer self with their Mighty "I AM" Presence - that True Identity that is the unique Individualization of Almighty God residing in each person. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within "Ascended Master Retreats" and "Mystery Schools". It is believed by adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that this wisdom was partially released by the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning in 1875, by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]], and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ''Ascended Masters'' through [[Guy Ballard]] in the [[I AM Activity]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 89, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I"&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''Law of Life - Book I'' (Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989), pp. 1–78, 91–102, 120–143, 215–216. The name "A. D. K. Luk" was the pseudonym of Alice Beulah (Schutz) Booras (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; However, theosophists maintain that the concept of Ascended Master is an exaggeration and corruption of the more modest theosophical concept of "Master of the Ancient Wisdom."[https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine?id=2382]  A similar problematic conflation of the term exits in the case of the Alice Bailey teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Beliefs about Ascended Masters==
Originally presented by [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] in the 1870s, the idea of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Mahatmas was adopted by people who at some point had had a connection with the Theosophical movement, such as Alice Bailey, [[Helena Roerich]], and [[Manly P. Hall]]. Later on many other organizations, especially in the [[United States]], developed the concept of Ascended Masters, which departs from the theosophical one in several aspects.

It is believed{{By whom?|date=August 2013}} that Ascended Masters are individuals who were formerly embodied on the Earth and learned the lessons of life during their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the [[Plane (esotericism)|matter plane]]s, balanced at least 51% of negative [[karma]], and fulfilled their [[Dharma]] (divine plan). An Ascended Master, in such an understanding, has become [[God]]-like and a source of unconditional "Divine Love" to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own "God Self," the "I AM Presence."

It is further claimed by various groups and teachers that the Ascended Masters serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of [[Spirit]], and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the ''Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth'', and members of the ''Great Brotherhood of Light'', also known as the ''Great White Lodge,'' ''[[Great White Brotherhood]],'' or ''Universal White Brotherhood'' (per [[Peter Deunov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989, pp. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alice Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] there are sixty ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'', defined as beings who have reached the Fifth Level of Initiation or above, with Djwhal Khul in a pivotal role as the master who telepathically dictated the many [[esoteric]] teachings in Baileys' books. [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] revealed, by taking "dictations" from them, the names of many dozens of additional Ascended Masters that were previously unknown.

The concept of recognizing the spiritual self, one's own psychological and karma battles and how to overcome them, and eventual Ascension of all humanity is covered in [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[Celestine Prophecy]]'' and its sequels, ''[[The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight]]''.  These books, while controversial, are recent popularizations of the concept of Ascension.

In Ascended Master teachings there is also mention of Serapis Bey, a being who was incarnated as a high priest in one of the "Temples of the Sacred Fire" on [[Atlantis]], and who migrated to [[Egypt]] at the time of the destruction of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays''. Summit University, Livingston, Montana, USA, 1986, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed {{By whom|date=February 2017}} that he was incarnated as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]] (who constructed the [[Temple of Luxor]] to the god [[Amun|Amon]])&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and also as [[Leonidas]], the King of [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of [[Thermopylae]] against the invasion of [[Greece]] by Emperor [[Xerxes I]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. According to teachings of Agni Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Elena Ivanovna. ''Letters to America''. In 4 Vols (1923–1952).  T. 4. Moscow: Sfera, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis Bey purports to be, in past lives, the Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], and the philosophers [[Confucius]], [[Plato]] and [[Seneca the Younger]] (Lucius Annaeus Seneca). He is referred to in the book ''Supermundane'' as ''The Thinker''.

===Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life===
This is properly called Isness; students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the "Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life", "The One", Who is the Source of all Love, Light, and Truth in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this "Allness of God" - "The One". ''The Voice of the I AM'' states "All Life is One" &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press December 1940 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence" as the Source of all consciousness and creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM'', Saint Germain Press, July 1942, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical [[theism]]), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this one God stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the "River of Life" and "Lifestream" to the one undivided God — the All in All — the Good — the Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come.(or from which all things, yin &amp; yang come. Even what one may perceive as darkness "evil" or "bad" is in someway working out for the Good and toward the elevation and ascension of all people. All things pervading or pouring out from the One perfect intelligent mind i.e. God), there is always an uninterrupted Oneness that is maintained with the Allness of God. From the One God all other realities, including Hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.

===The Individualized "I AM" Presence===
This is properly called Atma Brahman; adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an "Individualized Presence" of the "Most High Living God" — the "Mighty I AM Presence" — as part of humans' very nature and being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.

==Origins==
The founder of the Theosophical Society, Helen Blavatsky, in the late 19th century brought attention to the idea of secret initiatory knowledge, by claiming her ideas were based on traditions taught to her by a group of highly enlightened yogis which she called the Mahatmas or Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. These Mahatmas, she claimed, were physical beings living in the [[Himalayas]], usually understood as [[Tibet]]:
 {{quote|... they are living men, born as we are born, and doomed to die like every mortal. We call them “masters” because they are our teachers; and because from them we have derived all the Theosophical truths&amp;nbsp;... They are men of great learning, whom we call Initiates, and still greater holiness of life.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. (1968 [1889]). ''The Key to Theosophy''. London: Theosophical Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, the concept of the Mahatmas was developed by her successors in the Theosophical Society leadership, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]], who described them in great detail and added [[Master Jesus]] and Maitreya. In Leadbeater's book, ''The Masters and the Path'' (1925), the Masters are presented as human beings full of wisdom and compassion, albeit still limited by human bodies, which they choose to retain in order to keep in touch with humanity and help in its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa#The K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater|K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later organizations that used many of the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] for their own purposes, developed concept of Ascended Masters which bears some important differences with the Theosophical one. The ascended master Saint Germain has been releasing the ancient teachings in a more modern and simplified form, as can be found in the books of Peter Mt.

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through [["I Am" Activity|The "I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'', Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.

''Unveiled Mysteries'' says:
{{quote|Truly the Great Ascended Masters are Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the ancients that their activities have been brought down to us in the guise of myth and fable. They wield Tremendous God Power at all times because they hold with unwavering determination to the Great God Presence and hence all Power is given unto them for they are All-Perfection.&lt;br/&gt;
When Jesus said, 'All these things I have done, ye shall do and even greater things shall ye do,' he knew whereof he spoke," continued Saint Germain. "He came forth to reveal the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it is possible for every human being to attain and express while still here on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

==Jesus==
{{Main|Master Jesus}}
Jesus is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy and is one of the Ascended masters (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]; with white being in reference to the light) in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the "Ascended Master Teachings" as the Master of the [[Seven Rays|Sixth Ray]].&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust, 1925, p. 1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" until December 31, 1959, when, according to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of "Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''The Law of Life: Book II'', Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989; pages 267–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana: Summit University Press 1986 page 225&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] - they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.

According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the [[Prophet]] of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to aid the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magicians]] in the war of the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians that was going on in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] at that time.

According to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as [[Joshua]], the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara==
{{Main|Sanat Kumara}}
According to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy (specifically, the writings of [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], Alice A. Bailey, and [[Benjamin Creme]], as well as the Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard, [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings teachers), Sanat Kumara&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html Sanat Kumara] at ascension-research.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm A Progress Report On Our Ascension] at luisprada.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an "advanced being" of the Ninth Initiation (the highest Initiation possible on planet Earth) who is regarded as the Lord or Regent of [[Earth]] and of [[human race|humanity]], and the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]], a city said by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to be a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]].

It is believed by these authors that he is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, which is composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Fifth Initiation), Ascended Masters (Sixth Initiation), Chohans and Bodhisattvas (Seventh Initiation), Buddhas (Eighth Initiation), and highly spiritually-evolved volunteers from other worlds, who have all joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner. ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'', Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara was mentioned briefly  by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara - Volume I: pp. 89, 457–458; Volume II: pp. 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition  have misunderstood as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II, pp. 243 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when her follower Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997), pp. 296-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later theosophists such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have embellished the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.

==Comparison with Masters of Wisdom==
There is considerable difference between the concept of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy (as described by Blavatsky, [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], and others) and the current concept of Ascended Masters, developed by Guy Ballard and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] fifty-five years after the [[Theosophical Society]] was founded.

They added more than 200 new "Ascended Masters" that they claimed to receive dictations from in addition to receiving dictations from the original ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' of Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--See Profiles of the Ascended Masters Pages 13-394--More than 200 Ascended Masters are listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ascended Masters, as their name suggests, are supposed to be Masters who have experienced the miracle of ascension, as it is said Jesus did. The original teaching, channeled by Guy Ballard, was that a new Ascended Master would not die but would take the body up with him. This teaching of ascension is in direct opposition to the Theosophical teachings. Mahatma K.H. refers to the idea disparagingly in one of his letters to Sinnett:
{{quote|There was but one hysterical woman alleged to have been present at the pretended ascension, and&amp;nbsp;... the phenomenon has never been corroborated by repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 5. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blavatsky also rejects ascension as a fact, calling it "an allegory as old as the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Collected Writings vol. 8, p. 389. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91; See also CW 4:359-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical view, the Masters of Wisdom retain their physical bodies.

The Masters of the Wisdom are not like the Ascended ones, who are said to become Godlike, all-powerful beings beyond the laws of nature. In their teachings, the Theosophical Masters even denied that such beings exist. Mahatma K.H. wrote:
{{quote|If we had the powers of the imaginary Personal God, and the universal and immutable laws were but toys to play with, then indeed might we have created conditions that would have turned this earth into an Arcadia for lofty souls.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 474. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In their letters, the Mahatmas constantly talk about the "immutable laws" of the universe, and that they can help humanity only within the limits of these laws.

Proponents of the Ascended Masters sometimes attempt to account for these discrepancies by claiming that when the Theosophical Society (TS) was founded most of the Theosophical Mahatmas were still "unascended Masters". This leaves room to detach the Ascended Masters from the limitations. However, the Mahatma K.H. wrote: "We are not infallible, all-foreseeing 'Mahatmas' at every hour of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 450. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained: "An adept—the highest as the lowest—is one only during the exercise of his occult powers."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 257. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the Theosophical teachings, the higher the adept, the less we are likely to hear from him:
{{quote|The more spiritual the Adept becomes, the less can he meddle with mundane, gross affairs and the more he has to confine himself to a spiritual work&amp;nbsp;... The very high Adepts, therefore, do help humanity, but only spiritually: they are constitutionally incapable of meddling with worldly affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol. 6, p.247. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Theosophical view the Masters do not pay attention to personal desires. Theosophy teaches that the psychological ego is false, that the idea that we are this body, emotions, and mind is a mistake of perception and the source of sorrow. It says that real happiness comes only as an unsought by-product of reducing rather than increasing our attachment and identification with the personal. Blavatsky wrote that "Occultism is not . . . the pursuit of happiness as man understands the word; for the first step is sacrifice, the second renunciation."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol 8, p. 14, Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt; K.H. agreed with this when he wrote: "We—the criticized and misunderstood Brothers—we seek to bring men to sacrifice their personality—a passing flash—for the welfare of the whole humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H. in Chronological Sequence, p. 222. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; During the early times of the Theosophical Society, some members, misunderstanding the nature of the Mahatmas, would bring HPB some personal requests to ask of them. In a letter Blavatsky explained:
{{quote|The Masters would not stoop for one moment to give a thought to individual, private matters relating but to one or even ten persons, their welfare, woes and blisses in this world of Maya [illusion], to nothing except questions of really universal importance. It is all you Theosophists who have dragged down in your minds the ideals of our Masters; you who have unconsciously and with the best of intentions and full sincerity of good purpose, desecrated Them, by thinking for one moment, and believing that They would trouble Themselves with your business matters, sons to be born, daughters to be married, houses to be built,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;C. Jinarajadasa, ''Early Teachings of the Masters'' p. iv. Chicago: Theosophical Press, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This kind of interest is a very marked feature of the Ascended Masters. The Ascended Masters Teachings teach ways to attract material or emotional possessions to a person's life, and also how to dissolve unpleasant karma, a conception that the Theosophical Mahatmas emphatically opposed. For example, K.H. wrote: "Bear in mind that the slightest cause produced, however unconsciously, and with whatever motive, cannot be unmade, or its effects crossed in their progress—by millions of gods, demons, and men combined."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 77-78. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Ascended Masters are portrayed as cosmic fathers who will take care of their followers' problems. In contrast, Mahatma M. said: "We are leaders but not child-nurses."&lt;ref&gt;Eek, Sven, ed. ''Damodar and the Pioneers of the Theosophical Movement'', p. 605. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maitreya==
{{Main|Maitreya (Theosophy)}}
''Maitri'' is Sanskrit for "loving kindness." The [[Gautama Buddha|historical Buddha]] was reported to have said near the time of his death in the 4th century BCE that many Buddhas (awakened ones) had come before him, and that in the future another Buddha would come who would be greater than him, and who would embody "Maitri." This prophecy created the expectation of a Buddha Maitreya, which was probably fulfilled in the advent of the being now called "Jesus," likely Apollonius of Tyanna, who on his travels in India and the Far East was reported in many texts to have been called, "Issa," probably short for "Rishi" (great sage). His teachings embody that principal of loving kindness. ''Maitreya'' or ''Lord Maitreya'' is described in Theosophical literature of the late 19th-century and subsequent periods as an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. According to Theosophical [[doctrine]], one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of Humankind; in accord with this function Maitreya is said to hold the so-called ''Office of the World Teacher''. Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, [[Evolution (term)|evolutionary]] path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of World Teacher of Humankind.

The Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier [[Maitreya]] doctrine in [[Buddhism]]. However, they differ in important aspects, and developed differently. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] and [[Esoteric]] groups and movements. These have added, and advanced, their own interpretations and commentary on the subject.

=== {{anchor|dev}} Development of the concept ===
The first mention of Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840&amp;ndash;1921), an early Theosophical writer. The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in ''The Secret Doctrine'', a book originally published 1888. The work was the [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] of Helena Blavatsky, one of the physical founders of the [[Theosophical Society]] and of contemporary Theosophy. In it, the [[Messianism|messianic]] Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and [[Hindu]] religious traditions. In the same work Blavatsky was to assert that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history. These successive appearances of "emissarie{{interp|s}} of Truth" are according to the Blavatsky writings part of the unceasing oversight of Earth and of its inhabitants by a physically hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. The Theosophist, ""Alice Bailey,"" who broke with the Indian branch of the [[Theosophical Society]], and who was heavily influenced by orthodox Christianity, started the expectation that the ""Maitreya" would actually be reborn on the earth  as a physical being, fulfilling the Christian ideal of a [[Second Coming]], rather than the [[New Age]] ideal of the Christ being reborn in the heart of each individual.

==Initiation==
Initiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on [[Earth]] can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that [[human being]]s on [[Earth]] progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed{{By whom|date=August 2013}} that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy.  This concept was developed by both [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, Charles W. ''The Masters and the Path'', Adyar, Madras, India, Theosophical Publishing House, 1925, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]]. Those who do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into Spiritual Hierarchy governing [[nirvana]], gradually evolving upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, with other higher levels beyond.

The concept of Initiation is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Sixth Initiation is referred to as ''Ascension''. The first six initiations were named by Charles W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]]

==The Great White Brotherhood==
The [[Great White Brotherhood]], in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[New Age]], are said to be supernatural beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended masters.&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt; Various people have said they have received messages from these beings, including most notably [Helena Blavatsky (Theosophy), [[Aleister Crowley]] ([[Thelema]]), Alice A. Bailey ([[New Group of World Servers]]), Guy Ballard ([["I AM" Activity]]), Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), [[Mark L. Prophet]] &amp; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (Church Universal and Triumphant) and [[Benjamin Creme]] ([[Share International]]).&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

The Masters are collectively called the "Great White Brotherhood" by various theosophists and esotericists. The use of the term "white" refers to their advanced spirituality (in other words, that they have a white colored 
[[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]) and has nothing to do with race. Blavatsky described many of the Masters as ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, describe them as being from all cultures and races, such as the "Greek gentleman" known as [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]].&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Sisson, Marina Cesar. [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/sisson1.htm ''Helena Blavatsky and the Enigma of John King'']; originally published as ''Informativo HPB'', No. 3, 4 and 5 English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have taken the Theosophical philosophical concepts and added their own elements.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Gordon J.; Partridge, Christopher. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters by these organizations are: Jesus, Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], Maitreya, [[Confucius]], [[Duke of Chou|Lord Lanto]] (Confucius' historical mentor), [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]], Lady Master Nada, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], Saint Germain, and Kuthumi, to name but a few.&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"/&gt; It is believed that all of these put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictations==
Within "The I AM Activity" (founded by Guy Warren Ballard in the early 1930s), contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as "Messengers", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of "The I AM Activity." Those Addresses (known as "Dictations") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, and published in the monthly periodical ''The Voice of The "I AM"'', and some were collected and reprinted in the "green books" of ''The Saint Germain Series''. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other "Ascended Master Activities" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the religious organizations based on a belief in the Ascended Master Teachings, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pages 330 - 334&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as The Bridge to Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' 1951 - 1961 Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence.

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on ''The [[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' transcribed from the [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] by [[Levi Dowling|Levi H. Dowling]]. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups.  The book "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel" by ACCU founder Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk (pen-name of Alice Beulah  Schutz) (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994), the Saint Germain Series published by the Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from "The Lost Years of Jesus" compiled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and published by The Summit Lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Jacob L. "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
[[René Guénon]] wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy titled ''Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion'' (1921). In the book Guenon speculated that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books not from any supernatural masters. Guenon points out that Blavatsky spent a long time visiting a library at New York where she had easy access to the works of [[Jacob Boehme]], [[Eliphas Levi]], the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and other [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] treatises. Guenon also speculated that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the ''[[Kanjur]]'' and ''[[Tanjur]]'', translated by the eccentric orientalist [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the ''Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=René |last1= Guénon |others= Alvin Moore, Jr. and Cecil Bethell (trans.)| title = Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion | year=2004 | pages= 82–89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7_WwVFntyFwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'', Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in his book ''The skeptic's dictionary'' (2003) speculates that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll further speculates that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a tea cup and saucer as well as written the messages from her masters herself.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. ''The skeptic's dictionary'', 2003, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|Draft of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], also from 1789]]
A '''bill of rights''', sometimes called a '''declaration of rights''' or a '''charter of rights''', is a list of the most important [[rights]] to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against [[Civil and political rights|infringement from public officials and private citizens]]. 

Bills of rights may be ''[[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]'' or ''unentrenched''. An entrenched bill of rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure, instead requiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments. A bill of rights that is ''not entrenched'' is a normal [[statute law]] and as such can be modified or repealed by the legislature at will. 

In practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights articulated in its bill of rights.

==History==

The history of legal [[charter]]s asserting certain  rights for particular groups goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. An example is [[Magna Carta]], an English legal charter agreed between the King and his barons in 1215.&lt;ref name=Rau2016&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rau|editor1-first=Zbigniew|editor2-last=Żurawski vel Grajewski|editor2-first=Przemysław|editor3-last=Tracz-Tryniecki|editor3-first=Marek|title=Magna Carta: A Central European Perspective of Our Common Heritage of Freedom|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=1317278593|page=xvi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBHeCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR16&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Britain in its history proposed many pioneering documents - not only Magna Carta, 1215 but those such as the Provisions of Oxford 1258, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right 1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]], there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Petition of Right 1628]], the [[Declaration of Right, 1689]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] established certain rights in statute.

In America, the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]], which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|United States Declaration of Independence]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Maier|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Maier|title=American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence|year=1997|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-45492-6|pages=126-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] asserted the universality of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSDNl6Ydq_oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs78fI7vzYAhWJLsAKHdOID1kQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271040130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1789 by France's [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], during the period of the [[French Revolution]].

After the [[Constitution of the United States]] was adopted in 1789, the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was ratified in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d52OVwT_6PYC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Rights of Mankind: A History of the American Bill of Rights|last=Schwartz|first=Bernard|date=1992|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780945612285|pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6yyQXl4LmdAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjixLyPsf_YAhWkBcAKHcrPDQIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Bill of Rights and the States: The Colonial and Revolutionary Origins of American Liberties|last=Conley|first=Patrick T.|last2=States|first2=U.

The 20th century saw different groups draw on these earlier documents for influence when drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions in Western democracies==
The [[constitution of the United Kingdom]] remains uncodified,&lt;ref name=Rau2016/&gt; however the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law.

The '''capacity''' of [[natural person|natural]]  and [[juridical person|juridical]] persons ([[legal person]]s) in general, determines whether they may make binding amendments to their [[rights]], [[duty|duties]] and [[obligation]]s, such as getting [[marriage|married]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions|merging]], entering into [[contract]]s, making [[gift (law)|gifts]], or writing a valid [[will (law)|will]]. Capacity is an aspect of [[status (law)|status]] and both are defined by a person's ''personal law'':
*for natural persons, the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or ''[[lex domicilii]]'' in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, and either the law of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'', or of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states;
*for juridical persons, the law of the place of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'' for [[company (law)|companies]] while other forms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place in which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a presence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the transactions entered into.
When the [[law]] limits or bars a person from engaging in specified activities, any [[Contract|agreements]] or [[contract]]s to do so are either [[Voidable contract|voidable]] or [[Void contract|void]] for '''incapacity'''.  Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as ''incompetence''.  For comparison, see [[Competence (law)]].

==Discussion==
As an aspect of the [[social contract]] between a state and its [[citizen]]s, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In [[public policy (law)|public policy]] terms, this is the policy of ''[[parens patriae]]''. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of [[consanguinity]]), she cannot [[evasion (law)|evade]] that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Natural persons===
{{see also|Testamentary capacity}}
Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of [[freedom of contract]] and the detailed [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. Hence, for example, freedom of movement may be modified, the [[right to vote]] may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, [[English law]] used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minor (law)====
{{main article|Minor (law)}}

The definition of an ''infant'' or ''minor'' varies, each state reflecting local [[culture]] and [[prejudice]]s in defining the [[age of majority]], [[marriageable age]], [[voting age]], etc. In many [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, legal [[contract]]s, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor.  For a minor to undergo [[medical procedure]], [[consent]] is determined by the minor's parent(s) or [[legal guardian]](s).  The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often set at 21 years by U.S. [[state law]].  Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry younger. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the [[age of criminal responsibility]] to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see ''[[doli incapax]]''). For sexual crimes, the [[age of consent]] determines the potential liability of [[adult]] accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the [[British Columbia]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040617060433/http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm Infants Act]'' (RSBC 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

====Minors and Contractual Capacity====
A [[Minor (law)|minor]] (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, [[barter]] transactions such as purchasing a [[retail]] item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a [[legal fiction]] not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action.  A minor may not disavow such a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. &lt;u&gt;[http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm A Consent Theory of Contracts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033415/http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/u&gt; Columbia Law Review (March, 1986) pp. 299, fn 123&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Disaffirmance''' - it  must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states don't allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*'''Obligations''' - most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor’s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*'''Liability''' - for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor’s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*'''Ratification''' - accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Gaylord A. and Roger LeRoy Miller &lt;u&gt;Business Law Today: The Essentials&lt;/u&gt; South-Western College/West, Ohio, 2003 pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;
As one court put it, "the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect 'minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Hauer v. Union State Bank of Wautoma'', 192 Wis. 2d 576, 593 (1995), quoting ''Halbman v. Lemke'', 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====
{{See also|Insanity|mental disorder}}
Individuals may have an inherent physical condition which prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant [[power of attorney]] to an appointed [[legal guardian]].

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the [[Court of protection|Court of Protection]], and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This makes provision for [[Lasting power of attorney|lasting powers of attorney]] under which decisions about the health, welfare and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person's interests.

In Ireland the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act addresses the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia.  Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment and otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters.  If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs.  If the afflicted person owns his/her property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs.  Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs.  Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian.  The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M'Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or, if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Drunkenness or drug abuse====
Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

====Bankruptcy====
{{See also|Bankruptcy}}
If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some [[U.S. state|states]] have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the "enemy", including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Business entities===
*[[Corporations]]
The extent of an artificial person's capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation's capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is ''[[ultra vires]]'', i.e. "beyond the power" of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.
*General and limited partnerships
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the "firm" and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
*Unions
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
*[[Insolvency]]
When a business entity becomes insolvent, an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|The Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, also briefly called the [[Serbsky Institute]] (the part of its building in [[Moscow]])]]

In the [[Soviet Union]], a systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry]] took place&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvs|txt|author=US GPO|year1=1972|year2=1975|year3=1976|year4=1984|year5=1988}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2002|year2=2010a|year3=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on the interpretation of political dissent as a psychiatric problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}; {{harvnb|UPA Herald|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "psychopathological mechanisms" of dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}}

During the leadership of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], psychiatry was used as a tool to eliminate political opponents ("dissidents") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted official dogma.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17}} The term "philosophical intoxication" was widely used to diagnose mental disorders in cases where people disagreed with leaders and made them the target of criticism that used the writings by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15}} [[Article 58]]-10 of the Stalin Criminal Code—which as [[anti-Soviet agitation|Article 70]] had been shifted into the RSFSR Criminal Code of 1962—and Article 190-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code along with the system of diagnosing mental illness, developed by academician [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], created the very preconditions under which non-standard beliefs could easily be transformed into a criminal case, and it, in its turn, into a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|Kovalyov|2007}} Anti-Soviet political behavior, in particular, being outspoken in opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, writing books were defined in some persons as being simultaneously a criminal act (e.g., violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), a symptom (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and a diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report (Russian translation)|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

The process of psychiatric incarceration was instigated by attempts to emigrate; distribution or possession of prohibited documents or books; participation in civil rights actions and demonstrations, and involvement in forbidden religious activity.{{sfn|Chodoff|1985}} The religious faith of prisoners, including  well-educated former atheists who adopted a religion, was determined to be a form of mental illness that needed to be cured.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181}} The [[KGB]] routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds.{{sfn|Murray|1983}} Formerly highly classified government documents published after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] demonstrate that the authorities used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009a|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2013|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Fedenko|2009}}; see some documents in {{harvnb|Pozharov|1999}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Commentary on the Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care'', persons who were subjected to repressions in the form of commitment for compulsory treatment to psychiatric medical institutions and were rehabilitated in accordance with the established procedure receive compensation. The [[Russian Federation]] acknowledged that psychiatry was used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of "political psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2002}}; {{harvnb|Pshizov|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]] continues after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013|pp=16–18}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threatens human rights activists with a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|NPZ|2005}}

== Background ==
{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entails the [[exculpation]] and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009b|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abouelleil|Bingham|2014}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Laqueur|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Munro|2002a|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|loc1=p. 95|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Gluzman|1993}}; {{harvnb|Amnesty International|1991|pp=9, 64}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}}; {{harvnb|Bebtschuk|Smirnova|Khayretdinov|2012}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2001|pp=84, 108}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fedor|2011|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Ghodse|2011|p=422}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Gushansky|2005|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Horvath|2014}}; {{harvnb|Joffe|1984}}; {{harvnb|Kekelidze|2013}}; {{harvnb|Khvorostianov|Elias|2015}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=7, 47, 60, 67, 77, 259, 291}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Koryagin|year1=1988||year2=1989}}; {{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Leontev|2010}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Schmidt|Shchurko|2014}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2004|year2=2006}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Zile|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Punitive Medicine'' by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," is defined as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to service the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote in their joint ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters'', "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent… as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}} This work was published in Russian,{{sfn|Bukovsky|Gluzman|1975c}} English,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author1=Bukovsky|author2=Gluzman|year1=1975a|year2=1975d|year3=1975e}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,{{sfn|Boukovsky|Glouzmann|1975}} Italian,{{sfn|Bukovskij|Gluzman|Leva|1979}} German,{{sfn|Bukowski|Gluzman|1976}} Danish.{{sfn|Bukovskiĭ|Gluzman|1975b}}

Psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive.{{sfn|Malterud|Hunskaar|2002|p=94}} In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.{{sfn|Semple|Smyth|Burns|2005|p=6}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times coded threats to authority as mental disease during periods of political disturbance and instability.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.{{sfn|Noll|2007|p=3}}

In the Soviet Union [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''[[psikhushka]]'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]]. In 1939 it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]], the secret police and the precursor organization to the [[KGB]], under the order of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who was the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292}}

== Individual cases ==

=== Sergei Pisarev ===
Cases of political abuse of psychiatry have been known since the 1940s and 1950s. One of these early cases was that of party official [[Sergei Pisarev]]. Pisarev was arrested after criticizing the work of the Soviet secret police in the context of the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]], an anti-Semitic campaign waged at Stalin's instructions that should have brought about a new terror wave in the Soviet Union and possibly the extermination of the remaining Jewish communes that had outlived the Second World War.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} Pisarev was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital in [[Leningrad]] which along with an analogous hospital in Sychevka has started functioning since the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} After his discharge, Pisarev began a campaign against political abuse of psychiatry, concentrating on the [[Serbsky Institute]] which he viewed to be the seat of the trouble.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} As a consequence of his efforts, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] formed a committee which investigated the situation and came to the conclusion that political abuse of psychiatry was actually taking place.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}} The report, however, vanished in a desk drawer and never brought about any action.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=496}}

In 1961, Soviet general [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] regime.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by [[Lenin]].{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} Grigorenko formed a dissident group&amp;nbsp;— The Group for the Struggle to Revive [[Leninism]].{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} Soviet psychiatrists from commissions instituted to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times&amp;nbsp;— in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow's [[Lubyanka prison]], and from there for psychiatric examination to the Serbsky Institute{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were "an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions" and "reformist ideas."{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}} Grigorenko was irresponsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=151}} While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He required that his pension be restored.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely cut.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State's actions and received several warnings from the KGB.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} As Grigorenko had followers in Moscow, he was lured to [[Tashkent]], half a continent away.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Again he was arrested and examined by psychiatric team.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} None of the manifestations or symptoms cited by the Lunts commission were found by the second commission held in Tashkent under the chairmanship of [[Fyodor Detengof]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} The diagnosis and evaluation made by the commission was that "Grigorenko's [criminal] activity had a purposeful character, it was related to concrete events and facts... It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions."{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} The KGB brought Grigorenko back in Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had "a paranoid development of the personality" manifested by reformist ideas.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}} The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=12}} Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a usual mental hospital.{{sfn|Bursten|2001|p=152}}

In 1971, Dr. [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote a psychiatric report on Grigorenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Gluzman|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=73}} In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko with a mental illness.{{sfn|Sabshin|2009|p=95}}

Andrew, Grigorenko's son, was declared a hereditary madman in 1975 and was expelled from the USSR to the USA where he lives now.{{sfn|Sulkin|2012}} Andrew was repeatedly told that since his father was mentally ill, then he was hereditarily mentally ill as well, and if he would not stop his appearances in defense of human rights and his father, he was told to go to [[psikhushka]].{{sfn|Tolstoy|Gavrilov|2014}}

In 1979 in [[New York (city)|New York]], Grigorenko was examined by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists including [[Alan A. Stone]], the then President of [[American Psychiatric Association]].{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} The team came to the conclusion that they could find no evidence of mental disease in Grigorenko and his history consistent with mental disease in the past.{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} The conclusion was drawn up by [[Walter Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Reich|year1=1979|year2=1980a|year3=1980b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said Grigorenko's case confirms some of the accusations that psychiatry in the Soviet Union is sometimes employed as a tool of political repression.{{sfn|Argus-Press|1979}} In 1981, Pyotr Grigorenko told about his psychiatric examinations and hospitalizations in his memoirs ''V Podpolye Mozhno Vstretit Tolko Krys'' (''In The Underground One Can Meet Only Rats''){{sfn|Grigorenko|1981|pp=681–736}} translated into English under the title ''Memoirs'' in 1982.{{sfn|Grigorenko|1982}} In 1991, a commission, composed of psychiatrists from all over the Soviet Union and led by Modest Kabanov, director of the Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute in St Petersburg, spent six months reviewing the Grigorenko files, drew up 29 thick volumes of legal proceedings,{{sfn|Rich|1991}} and reversed the official diagnosis on Grigorenko in October 1991.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=73}} In 1992, the official post-mortem forensic psychiatric commission of experts met at Grigorenko's homeland removed the stigma of mental patient from him and confirmed that the debilitating treatment he underwent in high security psychiatric hospitals for many years was groundless.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=23}} The 1992 psychiatric examination of Grigorenko was described by the ''[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]'' in its numbers 1–4 of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2004|year2=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viktor Rafalsky ===
[[Viktor Rafalsky]], a political prisoner, dissident and author of unpublished plays, novels, and short stories, was committed to Soviet psychiatric prisons in [[Lviv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], and [[Leningrad]] for 24 years because of belonging to a clandestine Marxist group (from 1954 to 1959), writing anti-Soviet prose (from 1962 to 1965), and possessing anti-Soviet literature (from 1968 to 1983).{{sfn|Struk|1993|p=308}} In the winter of 1987, he was discharged and pronounced sane.{{sfn|Struk|1993|p=308}} In 1988, Viktor Rafalsky published the first version of his memoirs ''Reportazh iz Niotkuda'' (''Reportage from Nowhere''){{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=219}} describing his confinement in Soviet psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Rafalsky|1995}} In his memoirs, he writes, "I will say plain: when I got into a prison (it happened quite often), I, whether you believe or not, had a rest. So what was a prison in comparison with the horror of prison psikhushkas?!"{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=228}} Some pages below, he adds, "In a prison, you can read, write, lastly do something to kill time. In prison psikhushkas, you have the right only to look at the ceiling: it is forbidden to keep paper, pencils, and even a book."{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=240}}

=== Joseph Brodsky ===
[[File:Josef Brodsky crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Brodsky]] (1940–1996), a Russian poet, American essayist, and the 1987 [[Nobel laureate]] in Literature]]
At the very end of 1963, the poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] was committed for observation to the Kashchenko psychiatric clinic in Moscow where he stayed for several days.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} A few weeks later, his second hospitalization took place: on 13 February he was arrested in Leningrad.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} Brought to trial for "pursuing a parasitic way of life", Brodsky was accused of being a poet and of not doing more "productive" work.{{sfn|Szasz|1991}} There were two hearings of the trial dated 18 February and 13 March 1964.{{sfn|Szasz|1991}} The judge ordered to send him "for an official psychiatric examination during which it will be determined whether Brodsky is suffering from some sort of psychological illness or not and whether this illness will prevent Brodsky from being sent to a distant locality for forced labor. Taking into consideration that from the history of his illness it is apparent that Brodsky has evaded hospitalization, it is hereby ordered that division No. 18 of the militia be in charge of bringing him to the official psychiatric examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szasz|1991}}; {{harvnb|The New Leader|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February, the Dzerzhinsky District Court sent Brodsky for psychiatric examination to "Pryazhka," Psychiatric Hospital No. 2 where he spent about three weeks, from 18 February to 13 March.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=91}} In the mental hospitals, Brodsky was given "tranquilizing" injections, wakened in the middle of the night, immersed into a cold bath, wrapped in a wet sheet, and put next to the heater so that the sheet would cut into his body when it dried.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=279}}; {{harvnb|Brodsky|Haven|2002|p=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two stints at psychiatric establishments formed the experience underlying ''[[Gorbunov and Gorchakov]]'' written and called by Brodsky "an extremely serious work."{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=90}} In 1972, when the authorities considered Brodsky for exile and sought an expert opinion on his mental health, they consulted Snezhnevsky who, without examining him personally, diagnosed him as schizophrenic and concluded that he was "not valuable person at all and may be let go."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Valery Tarsis ===
[[File:Valery Tarsis (1906 - 1983) (7650226650).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Valery Tarsis]] (1906–1983), a Russian writer and political prisoner]]
In 1965 in the West, strong public awareness that Soviet psychiatry could be subject to political abuse arose with publication of the book ''Ward 7''{{sfn|Tarsis|1965}} by [[Valery Tarsis]], a writer born in 1906 in [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} He based the book upon his own experiences in 1963–1964 when he was detained in the Moscow Kashchenko psychiatric hospital for political reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}}

The fictionalised documentary'' Ward No. 7'' by Tarsis was the first literary work to deal with the Soviet authorities' abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} In a parallel with the story ''Ward No. 6'' by [[Anton Chekhov]], Tarsis implies that it is the doctors who are mad, whereas the patients are completely sane, although unsuited to a life of slavery.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} Individuals in ward No. 7 are not cured, but persistently maimed; the hospital is a jail and the doctors are gaolers and police spies.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} Most doctors know nothing about psychiatry, but make diagnoses arbitrarily and give all patients the same medication&amp;nbsp;— an algogenic injection or the anti-psychotic drug Aminazin{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}} known in the USA under trade name [[Thorazine]].{{sfn|Parr|1981|p=137}} Tarsis denounces Soviet psychiatry as pseudo-science and charlatanism and writes that, firstly, it has pretenses of curing the sickness of men's souls, but denies the existence of the soul; secondly, since there is no satisfactory definition of mental health, there can be no acceptable definition of mental disease in Soviet society.{{sfn|Marsh|1986|p=208}}

In 1966, Tarsis was permitted to emigrate to the West, and was soon deprived of his Soviet citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KGB had plans to compromise the literary career of Tarsis abroad through labelling him as a mentally ill person.{{sfn|Pietikäinen|2015|p=279}} As the 1966 memorandum to the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] reported, "KGB continues arrangements for further compromising Tarsis abroad as a mentally ill person."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Questions of Literature|1996}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1966|loc=P238/132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all the victims of Soviet psychiatry, Tarsis was the sole exception in the sense that he did not emphasised the 'injustice' of confining 'sane dissidents' to psychiatric hospitals and did not thereby imply that the psychiatric confinement of 'insane patients' was proper and just.{{sfn|Szasz|1978}}

=== Evgeni Belov ===
Shortly after publishing ''Ward 7'', a second case of political abuse of psychiatry gave rise to attention in [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} [[Evgeni Belov]], a young Moscow interpreter contracted by a group of four British students, made friends with them.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} At first he was positive about Soviet system, but gradually became more critical and began to voice demand for more freedom.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} Calling for a free press and free trade unions, Belov began to write letters to the Party.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} As a consequence, his membership in the Party was suspended and he was summoned to appear before a committee.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} He declined, and instead sought justice higher up by writing protest letters to [[Leonid Brezhnev]] himself.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} When British students returned from a short trip to [[Tokyo]], Belov had vanished.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} To their shock, it emerged that he had been committed to a mental hospital.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} A campaign to get him out yielded no results.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} A British newspaper published a letter in which Belov's father stated that his son was really sick, and the campaign came to a grinding halt.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} However, the public interest had been activated.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}}

=== Alexander Esenin-Volpin ===

Awareness in the West was also raised by the case of [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], a son of the famous Russian poet [[Sergei Esenin]] and born in 1924.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} In 1946, he was first committed to the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital for writing a poem considered anti-Soviet.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=140}} During Khrushchev's reign, Esenin-Volpin was later hospitalized three times: in 1957, in 1959–1960 in the same the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital and, finally, in 1962–1963.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In 1968, Esenin-Volpin was again hospitalized, and for this once his case achieved the attention in the West.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In February 1968, 99 Soviet mathematicians and scientists signed a protest letter to the Soviet officials demanding his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010b|p=141}}; {{harvnb|Zdravkovska|Duren|1993|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a wave of protests, he was discharged and permitted to immigrate to the USA where he obtained the position of professor of mathematics.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} In 2010, [[Alexander Magalif]], who hospitalized Esenin-Volpin, recollected that he had seen a little mark made by a pencil in the corner of the referral to treatment of Esenin-Volpin: "not to discharge from the hospital without coordination with KGB."{{sfn|Magalif|2010}}

=== Yuli Daniel ===
In 1965, the writer [[Yuli Daniel]] was arrested due to his satirical anti-Stalinist works and outspoken protest at the human rights abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Kosserev|Crawshaw|1994}} Daniel was kept in a mental hospital of the Gulag where he was refused medical treatment in order to destroy his will.{{sfn|Kosserev|Crawshaw|1994}}

After the [[1968 Red Square demonstration]] against the Soviet invasion into [[Czechoslovakia]], August 1968 saw the arrest of [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] well known in the West due to her book ''Red Square at Noon'' describing the demonstration.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} A few days later, the Serbsky Institute found her non-accountable and made diagnosis of "deep psychopathy—the presence of mild, chronic schizophrenic process cannot be excluded."{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} She was allowed to return to the care of her mother.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} In November 1969, a psychiatric commission again examined her, diagnosed "psychopathic personality with symptoms of hysteria and a tendency to decompensation", but considered that psychiatric hospitalization was not required.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} A month later, she was again arrested and sent to the Serbsky Institute for psychiatric examination in April 1970.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} The investigating commission chaired by Morozov found her non-responsible and suffering from "chronic, mental illness in the form of schizophrenia."{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} The commission found in her the presence of changes in the thinking processes and in the critical and emotional faculties characteristic of schizophrenia.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} It was concluded that Gorbanevskaya took part in the Red Square demonstration in a state of the mental disease.{{sfn|Shaw|Bloch|Vickers|1972}} In Paris, French psychiatrists at their request examined Gorbanevskaya and found her to be mentally normal.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p = 201}} They concluded that in 1969–1972 she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital for political, not medical reasons.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p = 201}}

=== Zhores Medvedev ===
On 29 May 1970, [[Zhores Medvedev]], an internationally respected and prominent scientist, was forcibly taken from his apartment in [[Obninsk]] and committed to a mental hospital where he was held, without legitimate medical justification, until 17 June 1970.{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} The leadership was instantly faced with the action of strong collective protest initiated by top Soviet scientists including [[Igor Tamm]] and [[Pyotr Kapitsa]].{{sfn|Jacobson|1972|p = 22}} Medvedev's release was achieved only after intense pressure from intellectuals and scientists both within and outside of the USSR.{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} He was largely hospitalized because of the publication abroad of his book of [[Trofim Lysenko]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1998|p = 95}} In widely circulated books, Zhores Medvedev had criticized the "geneticist" Lysenko and had also expressed his straightforward disagreement with restrictions on communication with scientists abroad.{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} He was removed from his position as head of a laboratory at the Institute of Medical Radiology and this removal was illegal, he said.{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} The diagnosis in the case-notes was "incipient schizophrenia," the diagnosis made by the psychiatric commission was "psychopathic personality with paranoid tendencies."{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p = 178}} What happened to Medvedev was not a separate incident; rather, it was part, in Medvedev's words, of "the dangerous tendency of using psychiatry for political purposes, the exploitation of medicine in an alien role as a means of intimidation and punishment&amp;nbsp;— a new and illegal way of isolating people for their views and convictions."{{sfn|Leichter|1979|p = 232}} This experience was reflected in Zhores Medvedev's and [[Roy Medvedev]]'s book ''A Question of Madness: Repression by Psychiatry in the Soviet Union'' published by Macmillan in London in 1971.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1971}}

The complication with regards to operational consequences lies in the fact that for political reasons he cannot be committed to a psychiatric hospital."{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p = 95}} Soviet authorities compulsorily committed Sakharov to a closed ward of the Semashko Hospital in Gorky, where he was force-fed and given drugs to change the state of his mind.{{sfn|Glazov|2015}}

[[Viktor Nekipelov]], a well-known dissident poet, was arrested in 1973, sent to the Section 4 of the Serbsky Institute of Forensic Psychiatry for psychiatric evaluation, which lasted from 15 January to 12 March 1974, was judged sane (which he was), tried, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} In 1976, he published in [[samizdat]] his book ''Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute''{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p = 147}} based on his personal experience at Psychiatric Hospital of the Serbsky Institute{{sfn|Jena|2008|p = 86}} and translated into English in 1980.&lt;ref name="Nekipelov 1980"&gt;{{harvnb|Nekipelov|1980}}; {{harvnb|Keefer|Pavlychko|1998|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this account, he wrote compassionately, engagingly, and observantly of the doctors and other patients; most of the latters were ordinary criminals feigning insanity in order to be sent to a mental hospital, because hospital was a "cushy number" as against prison camps.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} According to the President of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] [[Yuri Savenko]], Nekipelov's book is a highly dramatic humane document, a fair story about the nest of Soviet punitive psychiatry, a mirror that psychiatrists always need to look into.{{sfn|Savenko|2005b}} However, according to Malcolm Lader, this book as an indictment of the Serbsky Institute hardly rises above tittle-tattle and gossip, and Nekipelov destroys his own credibility by presenting no real evidence but invariably putting the most sinister connotation on events.{{sfn|Lader|1980}} After publishing his book, he was sentenced to the maximum punishment for "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" of seven years in a labor camp and then five years in internal exile.{{sfn|Lader|1980}}

== Political abuse of groups ==

=== AGDHR members ===
In 1968, the human rights movement in the USSR focused directly on Soviet political psychiatry, organizing public protests and writing international bodies.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=395}} In 1969, a group of about 14 activists including [[Sergei Kovalyov]], a future Russian human rights ombudsman, constituted the [[Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR]].{{sfn|Hegarty|Leonard|1999|p=343}} The group composed the first ''[[samizdat]]'' (self-published) human rights bulletin, ''[[A Chronicle of Current Events]]''.{{sfn|Hegarty|Leonard|1999|p=343}} Among the members of the Action Group were individuals who subsequently fell victim to psychiatric abuse themselves: the poet [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] who in 1968 demonstrated on [[Red Square]] against bringing Soviet tanks into [[Czechoslovakia]]; [[Vladimir Borisov]] who later was one of the founders of the independent labor movement in the Soviet Union; [[Vladimir Maltsev (translator)|Vladimir Maltsev]], a translator; and [[Leonid Plyushch]], a Ukrainian [[cyberneticist]] who was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital of [[Dnepropetrovsk]] and was awfully tortured with [[neuroleptics]].{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=141}} Later three senior Fellows of the Royal College of Psychiatrists examined Leonid Plyushch and "saw no indication of schizophrenia or other mental illness."{{sfn|Wing|Mechanic|2009|p=185}}

=== AFTU members ===
In November 1977, a group of unemployed and workers led by [[Vladimir Klebanov]], a former coalminer from the [[Donbas]] region of the [[Ukraine]], announced the formation in the Soviet Union of the [[Association of Free Trade Unions of Workers]] (AFTU) whose purposes were to meet obligations achieved by collective bargaining; to induce workers and other employees to join free trade union associations; to implement those decisions of the Association which concern the seeking of justice and the defense of rights; to educate Association members in the spirit of irreconcilability toward wastefulness, inefficiency, deception, bureaucracy, deficiencies, and a negligent attitude toward national wealth.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=55}} These purposes show that AFTU was in all respects an organization whose right to exist is guaranteed by the international obligations of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} On 19 December 1977, Klebanov along with two other workers in [[Donetsk]] was arrested by the Soviet militia and released nine days later, after international protests against his incarceration.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Worker [[Gavriil Yankov]] was incarcerated in Moscow mental hospital for two weeks.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} On 1 February 1978, AFTU publicly announced the institution of its organizational Charter.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Several days later, Klebanov was again detained by Soviet police and sent from Moscow to psychiatric prison hospital in Donetsk.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} Group member Nikolaev and workers Pelekh and Dvoretsky were also placed under psychiatric detention.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}}

=== SMOT members ===
By October 1978 it was apparent that arrests and repressions had resulted in the dissolution of AFTU.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} But the cause of trade union rights was to be invigorated by a new group, the [[Free Interprofessional Association of Workers]] known by its Russian acronym, SMOT, whose first press conference was held in Moscow on 28 October 1978.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} The objectives of SMOT were to defend its members in cases of violation of their rights in different spheres of their daily activities: political, domestic, religious, spiritual, cultural, social, and economic; to look into the legal basis of the workers' complaints; to ensure that these complains were brought to the notice of relevant organizations; to facilitate a quick solution to complaints of workers; and in cases of negative results, to publicize them widely before international and Soviet public.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=57}} The leadership of SMOT was headed by a native of [[Leningrad]] electrician [[Vladimir Borisov]] incarcerated in Soviet mental hospitals because of his human rights activism for a total of nine years in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=56}} In November and December 1978, Soviet police searched the homes of SMOT activists, and SMOT members Vladimir Borisov, [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]], [[Albina Yakoreva]], and [[Lev Volokhonsky]] were arrested and detained by Soviet authorities.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=58}} Both Borisov and Novodvorskaya were held in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Karatnycky|Motyl|Sturmthal|1980|p=58}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22517">'''Categorial grammar''' is a term used for a family of formalisms in [[natural language]] [[syntax]] motivated by the principle of [[compositionality]] and organized according to the view that syntactic constituents should generally combine as [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s or according to a function-argument relationship. Most versions of categorial grammar analyze sentence structure in terms of constituencies (as opposed to dependencies) and are therefore [[phrase structure grammar]]s (as opposed to [[dependency grammar]]s).

==Basics==
A categorial grammar consists of two parts: a lexicon, which assigns a set of types (also called categories) to each basic symbol, and some [[type inference]] rules, which determine how the type of a string of symbols follows from the types of the constituent symbols.  It has the advantage that the type inference rules can be fixed once and for all, so that the specification of a particular language grammar is entirely determined by the lexicon.

A categorial grammar shares some features with the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].
Whereas the [[lambda calculus]] has only one function type &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;,
a categorial grammar typically has two function types, one type which is applied on the left,
and one on the right. For example, a simple categorial grammar might have two function types &lt;math&gt;B/A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B&lt;/math&gt;.
The first, &lt;math&gt;B/A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the type of a phrase that results in a phrase of type
&lt;math&gt;B\,\!&lt;/math&gt; when followed (on the right) by a phrase of type &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
The second, &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the type of a phrase that results
in a phrase of type &lt;math&gt;B\,\!&lt;/math&gt; when preceded (on the left) by a phrase of type 
&lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  

The notation is based upon algebra. A fraction when multiplied by (i.e. concatenated with) its denominator yields its numerator. As concatenation is not [[commutative]], it makes a difference whether the denominator occurs to the left or right. The concatenation must be on the same side as the denominator for it to cancel out.

The first and simplest kind of categorial grammar is called a basic categorial grammar, or sometimes an AB-grammar (after Ajdukiewicz and Bar-Hillel).
Given a set of primitive types &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, let 
&lt;math&gt;\text{Tp}(\text{Prim})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the set of types constructed from primitive types.  In the basic case, this is the least set such that &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
and if &lt;math&gt;X, Y\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(X/Y), (Y\backslash X) \in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.
Think of these as purely formal expressions freely generated from the primitive types; any semantics will be added later.  Some authors assume a fixed infinite set of primitive types used by all grammars, but by making the primitive types part of the grammar, the whole construction is kept finite.

A basic categorial grammar is a tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, \text{Prim}, S, \triangleleft)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of symbols,
&lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of primitive types, and &lt;math&gt;S \in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; is the lexicon, which relates types to symbols &lt;math&gt;(\triangleleft) \subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim}) \times \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the lexicon is finite, it can be specified by listing a set of pairs like &lt;math&gt;TYPE\triangleleft\text{symbol}&lt;/math&gt;.

Such a grammar for English might have three basic types &lt;math&gt;(N,NP, \text{ and } S)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, assigning [[count noun]]s the type &lt;math&gt;N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, complete noun phrases the type
&lt;math&gt;NP\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and sentences the type &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then an [[adjective]] could have the type &lt;math&gt;N/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, because if it is followed by a noun then the whole phrase is a noun. 
Similarly, a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] has the type &lt;math&gt;NP/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
because it forms a complete noun phrase when followed by a noun.
Intransitive [[verb]]s have the type &lt;math&gt;NP\backslash S&lt;/math&gt;, and transitive verbs the type &lt;math&gt;(NP\backslash S)/NP&lt;/math&gt;.
Then a string of words is a sentence if it has overall type &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, take the string "the bad boy made that mess".  Now "the" and "that" are determiners, "boy" and "mess" are nouns, "bad" is an adjective, and "made" is a transitive verb, so the lexicon is
{&lt;math&gt;NP/N\triangleleft\text{the}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;NP/N\triangleleft\text{that}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N\triangleleft\text{boy}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N\triangleleft\text{mess}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N/N\triangleleft\text{bad}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;(NP\backslash S)/NP\triangleleft\text{made}&lt;/math&gt;}.

and the sequence of types in the string is

&lt;math&gt;
{\text{the}\atop {NP/N,}}
{\text{bad}\atop {N/N,}}
{\text{boy}\atop {N,}}
{\text{made}\atop {(NP\backslash S)/NP,}}
{\text{that}\atop {NP/N,}}
{\text{mess}\atop {N}}
&lt;/math&gt;

now find functions and appropriate arguments and reduce them according to the two [[inference rule]]s
&lt;math&gt; X\leftarrow X/Y,\; Y&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; X\leftarrow Y,\; Y\backslash X&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; N/N,\; N,\; (NP\backslash S)/NP,\; \underbrace{NP/N,\; N}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; N/N,\; N,\; \underbrace{(NP\backslash S)/NP, \quad NP}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; \underbrace{N/N,\; N}, \qquad (NP\backslash S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \underbrace{NP/N,\; \quad N},\; \qquad (NP\backslash S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \qquad\underbrace{NP,\; \qquad (NP\backslash S)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \qquad\qquad\quad\;\;\; S&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the result is &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means that the string is a sentence, while the sequence of reductions shows that it must be parsed as ((the (bad boy)) (made (that mess))).

Categorial grammars of this form (having only function application rules) are equivalent in generative capacity to [[context-free grammar]]s and are thus often considered inadequate for theories of natural language syntax. Unlike CFGs, categorial grammars are [[lexicalized]], meaning that only a small number of (mostly language-independent) rules are employed, and all other syntactic phenomena derive from the lexical entries of specific words.

Another appealing aspect of categorial grammars is that it is often easy to assign them a compositional semantics, by first assigning [[interpretation type]]s to all the basic categories, and then associating all the [[derived category|derived categories]] with appropriate [[Function (mathematics)|function]] types. The interpretation of any constituent is then simply the value of a function at an argument. With some modifications to handle [[intensionality]] and [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantification]], this approach can be used to cover a wide variety of semantic phenomena.

==Lambek calculus==

A Lambek grammar is an elaboration of this idea that has a
concatenation operator for types, and several other inference rules.
Pentus has shown that these still have the generative capacity of
context-free grammars.

For the Lambek calculus, there is a type concatenation
operator &lt;math&gt;\star\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, so
that &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
and if &lt;math&gt;X, Y\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(X/Y), (X\backslash Y), (X\star Y)\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.

The Lambek calculus consists of several deduction rules, which specify
how type inclusion assertions can be derived.  In the following
rules, upper case roman letters stand for types, upper case Greek
letters stand for sequences of types.  A sequent of the form
&lt;math&gt; X \leftarrow \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;
can be read: a string is of type &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if it consists of the concatenation
of strings of each of the types in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  If a type is
interpreted as a set of strings, then the
&lt;math&gt;\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\supseteq\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, "includes as a subset". 
A horizontal line means that the inclusion above the line
implies the one below the line.

The process is begun by the Axiom rule, which has no antecedents and
just says that any type includes itself.

&lt;math&gt;
(Axiom)\quad
{{}\over X \leftarrow X}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Cut rule says that inclusions can be composed.

&lt;math&gt;
(Cut) \quad
{Z \leftarrow \Delta X \Delta' \qquad X \leftarrow \Gamma
   \over
 Z \leftarrow \Delta \Gamma \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;

The other rules come in pairs, one pair for each type construction
operator, each pair consisting of one rule for the operator in the
target, one in the source, of the arrow.
The name of a rule consists of the operator and an arrow, with the
operator on the side of the arrow on which it occurs in the conclusion.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="5"

|-
|&lt;math&gt;
(\backslash \leftarrow) \quad
{Y\leftarrow X \Gamma
   \over
 X\backslash Y\leftarrow\Gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow \backslash) \quad
{Z \leftarrow \Delta Y \Delta' \qquad X\leftarrow\Gamma
   \over
 Z \leftarrow \Delta \Gamma(X\backslash Y) \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;
(/\leftarrow) \quad
{Y\leftarrow \Gamma X
  \over
Y/X\leftarrow\Gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow/) \quad
{Z\leftarrow \Delta Y \Delta' \qquad X\leftarrow\Gamma 
  \over
 Z\leftarrow \Delta (Y/X)\Gamma \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;
(\star\leftarrow) \quad {X\leftarrow \Gamma \qquad Y \leftarrow \Gamma'
  \over
X \star Y \leftarrow \Gamma\Gamma'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow\star) \quad {Z\leftarrow \Delta X Y \Delta'
   \over
Z\leftarrow \Delta (X \star Y) \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For an example, here is a derivation of "type raising", which says that
&lt;math&gt;(B/A)\backslash B \leftarrow A&lt;/math&gt;.  The names of rules and the substitutions used are to the right.

&lt;math&gt; 
\dfrac {\dfrac{}{B \leftarrow B} \qquad \dfrac{}{A \leftarrow A} }
       {\dfrac {B \leftarrow (B/A), \;\; A} 
               {(B/A)\backslash B \leftarrow A} }
\qquad
\begin{matrix}
  \mbox{(Axioms)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad{ }\\
  {(\leftarrow/)\,\,[Z=Y=B,X=A,\Gamma=(A),\Delta=\Delta'=()]}\\
  {(\backslash\leftarrow)\,\,[Y=B,X=(B/A),\Gamma=(A)]}\qquad\qquad\qquad{ }\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to context-free grammars===

Recall that a [[context-free grammar]] is a 4-tuple:

&lt;math&gt;G = (V,\, \Sigma,\, ::=,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
where

1. &lt;math&gt;V\, &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''non-terminals'' or ''variables''.

2. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''terminal symbols''.

3. &lt;math&gt;::=\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of production rules, that is, a finite relation
&lt;math&gt;(::=)\subseteq V \times (V \cup \Sigma)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

4. &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start variable.

From the point of view of categorial grammars, a context-free grammar
can be seen as a calculus with a set of special purpose axioms for
each language, but with no type construction operators and no
inference rules except Cut.

Specifically, given a context-free grammar as above, define a categorial
grammar 
&lt;math&gt;(\text{Prim},\, \Sigma,\, \triangleleft,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}=V\cup\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and   &lt;math&gt;\text{Tp}(\text{Prim})=\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. 
Let there be an axiom
&lt;math&gt;{x \leftarrow x}&lt;/math&gt; for every symbol 
&lt;math&gt;x \in V\cup\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
an axiom &lt;math&gt;{X \leftarrow \Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; 
for every production rule &lt;math&gt;X ::= \Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
a lexicon entry &lt;math&gt;{s \triangleleft s}&lt;/math&gt; for every terminal symbol 
&lt;math&gt;s \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and Cut for the only rule.
This categorial grammar generates the same language as the given CFG.

Of course, this is not a basic categorial grammar, since it has
special axioms that depend upon the language; i.e. it is not lexicalized.
Also, it makes no use at all of non-primitive types.

To show that any context-free language can be generated by
a basic categorial grammar, recall that 
any context-free language can be generated by a context-free grammar
in [[Greibach normal form]].

The grammar is in Greibach normal form if every production rule is
of the form
&lt;math&gt; A ::= s A_0 \ldots A_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
where capital letters are variables, &lt;math&gt;s \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;N\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, the right side of the production is a single terminal symbol
followed by zero or more (non-terminal) variables.

Now given a CFG in Greibach normal form,
define a basic categorial grammar with a primitive type
for each non-terminal variable
&lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}=V\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
and with an entry in the lexicon 
&lt;math&gt; A/A_{N-1}/ \ldots /A_0 \triangleleft s &lt;/math&gt;,
for each production rule
&lt;math&gt; A ::= s A_0 \ldots A_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
It is fairly easy to see that this basic categorial grammar
generates the same language as the original CFG.
Note that the lexicon of this grammar will generally
assign multiple types to each symbol.

The same construction works for Lambek grammars, since
they are an extension of basic categorial grammars.
It is necessary to verify that the extra inference rules
do not change the generated language.  This can be done
and shows that every context-free language is generated
by some Lambek grammar.

To show the converse, that every language generated by a
Lambek grammar is context-free, is much more difficult.
It was an open problem for nearly thirty years, from
the early 1960s until about 1991 when it was proven
by Pentus.

The basic idea is, given a Lambek grammar,
&lt;math&gt;(\text{Prim},\, \Sigma,\, \triangleleft,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
construct a context-free grammar
&lt;math&gt;(V,\, \Sigma,\, ::=,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
with the same set of terminal symbols, the
same start symbol, with variables some (not all) types
&lt;math&gt;V\subset \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
and with a production rule
&lt;math&gt;T::=\text{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
for each entry
&lt;math&gt;T\triangleleft\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;
in the lexicon,
and production rules &lt;math&gt;T::=\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
for certain sequents &lt;math&gt;T\leftarrow\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;
that are derivable in the Lambek calculus.

Of course, there are infinitely many types
and infinitely many derivable sequents, so in
order to make a finite grammar it is necessary
put a bound on the size of the types and sequents
that are needed.  The heart of Pentus's proof
is to show that there is such a finite bound.

===Notation===
The notation in this field is not standardized.  The notations used in
formal language theory, logic, category theory, and linguistics, conflict
with each other.  In logic, arrows point to the more general from the more particular,
that is, to the conclusion from the hypotheses.  In this article,
this convention is followed, i.e. the target of the arrow is the more general (inclusive) type.

In logic, arrows usually point left to right.  In this article this convention is
reversed for consistency with the notation of context-free grammars, where the
single non-terminal symbol is always on the left.  We use the symbol &lt;math&gt;::=&lt;/math&gt;
in a production rule as in [[Backus-Naur form]].  Some authors use an arrow, which
unfortunately may point in either direction, depending on whether the grammar is
thought of as generating or recognizing the language.

Some authors on categorial grammars write &lt;math&gt;B\backslash A&lt;/math&gt; instead of
&lt;math&gt;A\backslash B&lt;/math&gt;.  The convention used here follows Lambek and algebra.

==Historical notes==
The basic ideas of categorial grammar date from work by [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (in 1935) and [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] (in 1953). In 1958, [[Joachim Lambek]] introduced a [[Lambek Calculus|syntactic calculus]] that formalized the function [[type constructors]] along with various rules for the combination of functions. This calculus is a forerunner of
[[linear logic]] in that it is a [[substructural logic]]. [[Montague grammar]] uses an ad hoc syntactic system for English that is based on the principles of categorial grammar. Although [[Richard Montague|Montague's]] work is sometimes regarded as syntactically uninteresting, it helped to bolster interest in categorial grammar by associating it with a highly successful formal treatment of natural language [[semantics]]. More recent work in categorial grammar has focused on the improvement of syntactic coverage. One formalism which has received considerable attention in recent years is [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]'s [[combinatory categorial grammar]] which builds on [[combinatory logic]] invented by [[Moses Schönfinkel]] and [[Haskell Curry]].

There are a number of related formalisms of this kind in linguistics, such as [[type logical grammar]] and [[abstract categorial grammar]].

==Some definitions==
;Derivation: A derivation is a binary tree that encodes a proof.
;Parse tree: A parse tree displays a derivation, showing the syntactic structure of a sentence.
;Functor and Argument: In a right (left) function application, the node of the type A\B (B/A) is called the functor, and the node of the type A is called an argument.
;Functor-argument structure{{what| where's the definition?|date=July 2015}}

==Refinements of categorial grammar==
A variety of changes to categorial grammar have been proposed to improve syntactic coverage. Some of the most common ones are listed below.

===Features and subcategories===
Most systems of categorial grammar subdivide categories. The most common way to do this is by tagging them with [[grammatical feature|features]], such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Sometimes only atomic categories are tagged in this way. In Montague grammar, it is traditional to subdivide function categories using a multiple slash convention, so ''A/B'' and ''A//B'' would be two distinct categories of left-applying functions, that took the same arguments but could be distinguished between by other functions taking them as arguments.

===Function composition===
Rules of function composition are included in many categorial grammars. An example of such a rule would be one that allowed the concatenation of a constituent of type ''A/B'' with one of type ''B/C'' to produce a new constituent of type ''A/C''. The semantics of such a rule would simply involve the composition of the functions involved. Function composition is important in categorial accounts of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and extraction, especially as they relate to phenomena like [[right node raising]]. The introduction of function composition into a categorial grammar leads to many kinds of derivational ambiguity that are vacuous in the sense that they do not correspond to semantic ambiguities.

===Conjunction===
Many categorial grammars include a typical conjunction rule, of the general form ''X CONJ X → X'', where ''X'' is a category. Conjunction can generally be applied to nonstandard constituents resulting from type raising or function composition..

===Discontinuity===
The grammar is extended to handle linguistic phenomena such as discontinuous idioms, gapping and extraction.

'''Children's use of information''' is an issue in [[ethics]] and [[child development]]. Information is learned from many different sources and '''source monitoring''' (see also [[source-monitoring error]]) is important in understanding how people use information and decide which information is [[credibility|credible]]. Consider the example of a parent whose child has been diagnosed with [[hyperactivity]]; the parent searches the internet for information, reads books, participates in an online chat room with other parents in the same situation, and consults various medical professionals. Some of these sources will be credible (contain reliable information), and others will not. To be well-informed, the parent must filter information according to the reliability of the source.

Children learn about the world in much the same way. They are told things by numerous people (e.g., teachers, parents, siblings, and friends), see things on the television or internet, and read information in books. Can children be effective consumers of information? At what age are they able to do this? How do they deal with ambiguous resources? This page will detail answers to those questions (and others) by drawing on peer-reviewed scientific research.

==The development of source monitoring==
Young children have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the sources of information than adults do.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindsay | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Kwon | first3 = P. | year = 1991 | title = Developmental changes in memory source monitoring | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 297–318 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(91)90065-z | pmid=1770330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[episodic memory]] improves throughout childhood, development in the area of source monitoring tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = K.

While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of source monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: source monitoring theory, [[fuzzy-trace theory]], [[schema theory]], person-based perspective, and the mental-state reasoning model.

===Source monitoring theory===
According to source monitoring theory, the source of information is attributed through a decision-making process, where source is inferred based on various characteristics inherent in the memory itself.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"/&gt; This means that the sources are not directly [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], but rather [[Reconstructive memory|reconstructed]], when information is recalled. This decision-making process can either be through automatic, unconscious processing, or through heightened demanding and systematic processing that may require reasoning, and the retrieval of supporting memories. This theory implicates the development of episodic memory and memory strategies in the development of source monitoring more generally.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
{{see also|Fuzzy-trace theory}}
Fuzzy-trace theory hypothesizes that the source-monitoring errors that children make are caused by problems with memory [[Storage (memory)|storage]] and [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brainerd | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Reyna | first2 = V. F. | year = 1990 | title = Gist is the grist: Fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–47 | doi=10.1016/0273-2297(90)90003-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories are simultaneously stored in two different formats: the "gist" level (extracted from the experience), and the "verbatim" representation (information in exact detail). It is proposed that the source of information is encoded in memory as a verbatim detail. Memories for verbatim details decay more quickly over time than gist representations, and young children demonstrate faster decay of verbatim information than older children or adults. Younger children are more likely to experience memory intrusions due to weaker memory traces, which leads to a susceptibility to misleading information replacing memory traces from a previous event.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"/&gt; For this reason, developmental changes in episodic memory performance are viewed as the driving factor in source monitoring development.

===Schema theory===
{{see also|Schema (psychology)}}
Schema theory, as a derivative of [[script theory]], states that after repeated exposure to similar events, individuals form a general representation of what typically happens.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, M. J., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1990). Developmental differences in the relation between scripts and episodic memory: Do they exist? In Knowing and remembering in young children, Fivush, Robyn, Hudson, Judith A. eds., (pp. 30-64). Cambridge University Press, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Some details are the same at each instance of repeated events, and others can vary from instance to instance. In the script for what usually happens, there is a "slot" for each variable detail and the detail for a particular time is chosen from a list of possible variations. If source information is encoded as a slot, errors in source monitoring can be the result of incorrect retrieval of a specific detail. This framework allows for the storage of a large amount of detailed information about specific events, however is very cognitively demanding for children. Because of their limited cognitive resources, young children require more experience with repeated events in order to generate a schema. Details that vary from instance to instance can be lost, and children rely instead on the generalized event representation when attempting to recall a particular instance. The main assumption is that the development of source monitoring depends on an increase in cognitive processing capacity.

===Person-based perspective===
Person-based perspective emphasizes [[Prospective memory|prospective processes]]. Prospective processes relate actions to one another through operations such as sequencing and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Foley | first2 = M. A. | year = 1996 | title = A unifying framework for the development of children's activity memory | url = | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 33–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are affected by the perspective taken (self vs. other) or the goals and meaning to the individual. The meaning attached to the goal of an action can interfere with source monitoring by removing attention from the source details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Ratner | first2 = H. H. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing between memories for thoughts and deeds: The role of prospective processing in children's source monitoring | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1998.tb00765.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person-based perspective is social-cognitive in nature (more so than other theories of source monitoring) and assumes that development is reliant on socialization and [[theory of mind]] development.

===Mental-state reasoning model===
The mental-state reasoning model highlights possible mechanisms behind young children's suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;Welch-Ross, M. (2000). A mental-state reasoning model of suggestibility and memory source monitoring. In Children's source monitoring, Roberts, Kim P., Blades, Mark, eds., (pp. 227-255). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have difficulty with reasoning about conflicting [[mental representation]]s are likely to overwrite their original memories with misinformation because they cannot reconcile two contradicting views of what actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bright-Paul | first1 = A. | last2 = Jarrold | first2 = C. | last3 = Wright | first3 = D. B. | year = 2008 | title = Theory of mind development influences suggestibility and source monitoring | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1055 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1055–1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Source monitoring and the understanding of knowledge states, play a key role in resisting suggestions. The development of source monitoring is presumed to be based on better understanding of knowledge states, [[metacognition]] and theory of mind.

==The origins of knowledge==
Being aware of how we have acquired information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3 to 5 year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3 and 4 year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. Perhaps it is because they felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D. K. | last2 = Astington | first2 = J. W. | last3 = Flavell | first3 = J. H. | year = 1992 | title = Young children's understanding of the role that sensory experiences play in knowledge acquisition | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge and justification===
When asked '''knowledge questions''' ("Do you know what is in the box?") then '''justification questions''' ("How do [or why don't] you know what is in the box?"), children who can correctly answer are able to reflect on knowledge that they have gained from a particular source and should be able to identify the source of information.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Hogrefe | first2 = | last3 = Perner | first3 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Children's understanding of informational access as source of knowledge | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 386–396 | doi=10.2307/1130318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3 and 4 year-olds are better at answering these questions when the questions refer to themselves in comparison to referring to another person. When these children are shown a hidden object they can correctly report their perceptual access (responding correctly to "Did you look into the box?") and their knowledge access of what is in the box (responding correctly to "Do you know [not know] what is in the box?").&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; Despite their ability to answer correctly when referring to the self, 3 and 4 year-olds have difficulty responding to the "other's" knowledge, where they deny the "other" has the knowledge. 3-4 year-olds can correctly identify that the other person has in fact looked in a box, but when asked "Does [other] know what is in the box?" the child will deny that the other person knows what is in the box.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; The key assumption is then that although children are aware that perceptual access is needed, they are unable to acknowledge that the knowledge was gained from perceptual access.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pratt | first1 = C. | last2 = Bryant | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Young children understand that looking leads to knowing (so long as they are looking into a single barrel) | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 973–982 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02835.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaining knowledge through looking, touching, and asking===
Gaining knowledge is knowing how to acquire new information. The ability to recognize how specific knowledge can be gained by perceptual access (looking, feeling or smelling) is the understanding of Aspectuality. '''Aspectuality''' understanding is the awareness that an object is made up of many different properties (colour, weight, odour), which can be determined by a specific perceptual action (looking, feeling, smelling).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = S. R. | year = 2012 | title = How should we question young children's understanding of aspectuality? | url = | journal = The British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 376–392 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02044.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the colour of a car outside the window could involve asking someone for the information or looking out the window. In most cases, adults would acquire this knowledge from simply looking out the window. However, not all information can be gained in this manner. If you were asked to find out how old the driver of the car is, simply looking would not provide accurate information; you would have to ask. These two situations are dependent on whether the information being sought out is visible or invisible (respectively).&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitneva | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Lam | first2 = N. H. L. | last3 = Dunfield | first3 = K. A. | year = 2013 | title = The development of children's information gathering: To look or to ask? | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 533–542 | doi = 10.1037/a0031326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge development depends on children's ability to efficiently pursue their informational goal. Children do not always make the most effective or efficient decision when acquiring new information.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

====Age differences====
6 year-olds are able to distinguish when gaining knowledge requires looking (the information is visible) or when gaining knowledge requires asking (the information is invisible). However, 4 year-olds do not perform as consistently. Even with an [[expert]] present, 4 year-olds will [[estimation|overestimate]] the knowledge they can gain through looking. However, when the information to be gained is regarding a group of friends and the expert is a friend of the group, 4 year-olds tend to overestimate knowledge acquisition through asking.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

When given access to pairs of objects, which could either be identified by seeing (identical objects: different in colour) or by touch/feeling (identical objects: 1 soft, 1 hard), children perform relatively well, generally recognizing when they have adequate information and when they have inadequate information (i.e., knowing the object is blue after seeing it or knowing the object is soft after feeling it).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Pendle | first3 = J. E. C. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of the knowledge gained from seeing and feeling | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 299–305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00676.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when young children are not given access (of seeing or feeling), they have difficulty predicting and identifying which mode of access would allow them to identify the object.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"/&gt; In this case, 3 and 4 year-olds overestimate the knowledge that could be gained through feeling the object.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt; 3 to 4 year-olds may not understand the perceptual access needed to acquire the specific knowledge.

===Language and question phrasing===
Waters and Beck (2012) state "understanding the link between perceptual access and consequent information (knowledge access) is a crucial component in the development of [[theory of mind]]". In a typical adult population, change in the phrasing of a particular question would not affect the understanding of what action needs to occur. "What colour is the bike that is outside?" or "Is the bike red?" should not change the action of ''looking'' to gain the needed information. However, children's performance is susceptible to this type of question phrasing.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doherty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Metalinguistic awareness and theory of mind: Just two words for the same thing? | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 279–305 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(98)90012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perner | first1 = J. | last2 = Rendl | first2 = B | last3 = Garnham | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Objects of desire, thought, and reality: Problems of anchoring discourse referents in development | url = | journal = Mind &amp; Language | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 475–513 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are language effects on knowledge access through 3 different question types:&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012" /&gt;

#'''Identity''': "Find out ''which one'' is in the tunnel",
#'''Dimension''': "Find out ''what colour'' the one in the tunnel is"
#'''Aspect''': "Find out if the one in the tunnel ''is the red one'' or ''the blue one''".

4 and 5 year-olds are more likely to respond correctly to aspect and dimension questions in comparison to identity questions.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt; Aspect and dimension questions are more explicit, which may be why performance is better in these categories. Identity questions require more cognitive effort as one has to remember how the objects were similar and how they differed.

==Judging the credibility of sources and understanding of trust==
Much of people's knowledge about the world is not obtained from direct experience, but indirectly from what other people or sources tell them. With widespread use of the internet people have access to nearly unlimited sources of information. Some of that information might be conflicting, and different sources of information vary in their accuracy and credibility. People can also deliberately [[deception|deceive]], be misunderstood, or be mistaken.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nurmsoo | first1 = E. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2009 | title = Children's trust in previously inaccurate informants who were well or poorly informed: When past errors can be excused | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 23–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01243.x | pmid=19236390}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that people develop the necessary skills to assess the accuracy of what they are being told.

===Adults' credibility judgments===
Adults make credibility judgments based on two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs because we know that anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone's intention is to sell you something, you might be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research.

===Children's ability to make credibility judgments===
Even very young children show an early sensitivity to issues of source credibility. By the age of 4, children show similar patterns to adults in a preference for perception over testimony; that is, they would rather see something with their own eyes than be told about it. Children also feel more confident in their knowledge when they have directly perceived it than if they have been told by someone else, even if the speaker is well informed.&lt;ref name="Robinson2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Nurmsoo | first3 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of knowledge sources: Confidence in knowledge gained from testimony | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 105–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children are not always able to directly perceive information, and they learn much of what they know from others. Some people are more [[credibility|credible]] sources of information than others, so children must actively evaluate information and decide whether or not to believe it. There are many factors or cues that children, by the age of 4, take into consideration when making judgements about whether or not to trust what a person says. For instance, [[knowledge]] and experience, [[trait theory|traits]], [[motivation]]s, age, and reasoning or support.

====Credibility judgments based on knowledge and experience====
Young children have a reputation for [[credulity]], or believing something without having any proof that it is true. Young children often [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] what adults tell them, especially when they have no prior knowledge or expectations about the topic of the testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Carrington Croft | first2 = A. | last3 = Setia | first3 = A. R. | last4 = Cole | first4 = C. A. | year = 2010 | title = Young children have a specific, highly robust bias to trust testimony | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 1541–1547 | doi=10.1177/0956797610383438 | pmid=20855905 | pmc=3507998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because children tend to interact with adults who are more knowledgeable than themselves, if they have no reason to believe otherwise, they will trust what adults tell them. In particular, 3 year-olds tendency to believe others is based on a selective bias to trust what people tell them. This selective trust is adaptive in the early years as they are learning language and their way around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baier | first1 = A | year = 1986 | title = Trust and anti-trust | url = | journal = Ethics | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 231–260 | doi=10.1086/292745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have difficulty disregarding information provided to them, even if the source has been unreliable in the past. 3 year-olds will often continue to believe what a person tells them even after being repeatedly deceived by that person, but 4 year-olds are far better able to disregard this unreliable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mascaro | first1 = O. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = The moral, epistemic, and mind- reading components of children's vigilance towards deception | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2009.05.012| journal = Cognition | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 367–380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-year-olds are better at making trust judgments when they are able to choose between two sources of knowledge, rather than deciding whether or not to believe a single person, and in this situation they are often able to choose the more reliable of two speakers.&lt;ref name="Lane2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J.

====Credibility judgments based on traits and motivation====
Almost all human institutions (e.g., family, community, business, government) are built on a foundation of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Xu2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = F. | last2 = Evans | first2 = A.

(1999). Selected philosophical works. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various schools of philosophical thought that posits honesty to be morally right and lying to be morally wrong. On one end of the continuum, philosophers like Bok,&lt;ref&gt;Bok, S. (1978). Lying: Moral choice in public and private life. New York, NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1949). On a supposed right to lie from altruistic motives. In L.W. Beck (Ed.), Critical of practical reason and other writings (pp.346–350). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Augustine&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, St. (1952). Treaties on various issues. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hold a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view that focuses on intrinsic duties relating to the treatment of others. In other words, telling the truth is intrinsically right and lying is intrinsically wrong. On the other end of the continuum is the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view that emphasizes the greater good, specifically with respect to the outcome of one's act. Therefore, lying and its moral implications are context dependent.&lt;ref&gt;see for example, Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, such as when being polite to spare another person's feelings, making a "prosocial lie" or deliberate false statement are endorsed.

Children consider motivation, as well as traits, when deciding who to seek information from and who to believe. In both Eastern and Western cultures, both adults and children adhere to the utilitarian perspective when giving moral evaluations of truths and lies in different social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 = | last2 = Fu | first2 = G. | last3 = Evans | first3 = A. D. | last4 = Wang | first4 = L. | last5 = Lee | first5 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Lying in the name of collective good: A developmental study | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00695.x | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 495–503 | pmc = 2570108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of people's characteristics, children tend to place trust in people who are honest, smart, or [[Kindness|kind]] over people who are dishonest, not smart, or not kind.&lt;ref name="Lane2013" /&gt; However, they also consider a person's intent or [[motivation]]. From age 7, children consider both [[honesty]] and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] when making trust judgments about other people, and older children are more likely to trust people who tell prosocial lies (to avoid hurting another person's feelings or to help another person) than young children.&lt;ref name="Xu2013" /&gt; For younger children, honesty is more important than a person's intention. As children get older, they increasingly attend to motivation as a key factor. The relationship between telling the truth and trusting a person is stable, but when it comes to lying, children consider the motivation of the speaker when deciding whether or not to trust them.

====Credibility judgments based on age and reliability====
Children evaluate the [[credibility]] of a speaker by evaluating how reliable that person has been in the past and can make predictions about a speaker based on their age.&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Neely | first2 = L. A. | year = 2006 | title = Adults don't always know best: Preschoolers use past reliability over age when learning new words | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 757–758 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01778.x | pmid=16984291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as 3 years-old prefer to trust an unfamiliar adult rather than an unfamiliar child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M. | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = B.S. | last3 = Bowden | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = Perspective taking and theory of mind: Do children predict interpretive diversity as a function of differences in observers' knowledge? | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 1334–1351 | doi=10.2307/1130810}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering both age and reliability, age is often the primary cue used to determine another's credibility. For example, 3 and 4 year-olds found adults to be more trustworthy than peers, unless the peer demonstrated greater reliability (i.e., adult incorrectly mislabelled objects, whereas peer correctly labelled them).&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006" /&gt; Children also consider both the prior history of accuracy and the level of perceptual access the speaker has when they provide information. Young children spontaneously keep track of the prior history of a person's accuracy or inaccuracy (reliability) and prefer to learn from someone with a good track record.&lt;ref name="Birch2008" /&gt; Children commonly interpret the speaker's history of inaccuracy as a lasting trait and so the speaker is considered an unreliable informant, at least within the domain they have been wrong about. However, under certain conditions, children may excuse a person's past inaccuracy and later [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] that person for information. If a speaker has limited information (e.g., lack of perceptual access) in making a claim – for example, inaccurately identifying a toy while blindfolded – then children as young as 3 years-old appropriately excuse their past inaccuracy especially when they are later well-informed.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009" /&gt; On the other hand, if a speaker has full access to information while making an inaccurate claim, children continue to regard him/her as unreliable.

====Credibility judgments based on reasoning or support====
Young children appreciate that people generally think and act sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing the quality of the reasoning provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Bartsch | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Young children's reasoning about beliefs | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(88)90021-2 | journal = Cognition | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 239–277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based on the quality of the reasons they offer when making a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = Beyond semantic accuracy: Preschoolers evaluate a speaker's reasons | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1051–1063 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01742.x | pmid=22417290}}&lt;/ref&gt; As young as 3 years-old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony ("My teacher told me there's a book in the bag. I think that there's a book"), looking ("Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there's a ball in there"), and [[inference]] ("It's a backpack. Backpack holds books. I think there's a book in there").&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; On the other hand, [[desire]] ("I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there"), pretense ("I like to pretend. I'm going to pretend that there's a sandwich in the bag. I think there's a sandwich in there"), and guessing ("I don't know. I'm going to guess that there's a toy in the bag") are not viewed as strong support for a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3 and 4 year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past).&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt;

===Children's development of distrust===
People are not always reliable in their provision of information and it is important to be able to differentiate between good sources and bad sources. Assessing someone's reliability is based not only on the knowledgeability of the speaker, but their motives/[[intention]]s as well. People may not always be motivated to tell the [[truth]]; instead, they may potentially [[lie]] to promote their own interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Legare | first2 = C. H. | year = 2005 | title = Children's evaluation of sources of information about traits | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.636 | pmid=16060810}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interest of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G.

E. | last2 = Liu | first2 = D. | last3 = Heyman | first3 = G.

Beginning at 5 years-old, children use a person's prior history of deception to make reliability judgments about that person.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt;

== Metacognition ==
[[Metacognition]] is an ability that allows people to think about their own thinking process, and how to use their thinking process to help themselves learn better. Metacognition includes two separate abilities: (1) knowledge of cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="schraw1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schraw | first1 = G. | last2 = Dennison | first2 = R. S. | year = 1994 | title = Assessing metacognitive awareness | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 460–475 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1994.1033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="brown1987"&gt;Brown, A. L. (1987). Metacognition, executive control, self-regulation, and other more mysterious mechanisms. In F. E. Weinert &amp; R. H. Kluwe (Eds.), Metacognition, motivation, and understanding (pp. 65-116). Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of one's thinking process is not enough to regulate an individual's behaviour, and are required to use specific strategies to help them regulate their behaviour.&lt;ref name="schraw1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1987" /&gt;

===Knowing you don't know===
An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately "know when they know", but often overestimate when they don't know.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = W. P | year = 1982 | title = Knowing when you don't know enough: Children's judgments about ambiguous information | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 267–280 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's behaviour does not seem to match their verbal ability to acknowledge their "lack of knowledge". Despite incorrectly stating that they "know" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = S. J. | year = 1985 | title = Children's responses to ambiguous messages and their understanding of ambiguity | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 446–454 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.3.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately "know what they know" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word "know" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C. Bryant | last2 = Furrow | first2 = D. | year = 1989 | title = Mental terms and the development of certainty | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 167–171 | doi=10.2307/1131082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's judgments about ignorant and ambiguous sources===
[[Ambiguity|Ambiguous]] information is "a piece of information (word, message, or view) with multiple interpretations".&lt;ref name="beck2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Freeth | first3 = M. M. | year = 2008 | title = Children can resist making interpretations when uncertain? | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 252–270 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2007.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults not only have the awareness to realize when ambiguity exists, but they also have strategies to deal with ambiguous input. Young children have difficulty with recognizing ambiguity and understanding how to handle it. Typically, it is not until the age of 6 or 7 that children have the ability to successfully deal with ambiguous input.&lt;ref name="beck2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2001 | title = Children's ability to make tentative interpretations of ambiguous messages | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 95–114 | doi=10.1006/jecp.2000.2583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singer1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Flavell | first2 = J. H. | year = 1981 | title = Development of knowledge about communication: Children's evaluation of explicitly ambiguous messages | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1211–1215 | doi=10.2307/1129508}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems in certain contexts with certain tasks, younger children also display some ability to deal with ambiguous information.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992"&gt;Mitchell, P . &amp; Robinson, E. J. (1992). Children's understanding of the evidential connotation of 'know' in relation to overestimation of their own knowledge, Journal of Child Language, 19, 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of language and prior experience===
Language can play an important role in the ability to correctly decipher ambiguous input. One can "know" someone in many different ways, for example, seeing them, talking to them, having a prior history with them, etc. This makes questions like "Do you know?" very complicated and difficult to respond to. More explicit definitions of "to know" seem to assist children in better assessing their own knowledge. Children as young as 4 years were able to make far more accurate statements about their actual knowledge when a question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Children's judgements of ignorance on the basis of absence of experience | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 113–129 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1994.tb00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 6, children are typically able to accurately assess their knowledge with very little impact on their future behaviours regardless of the language used. 4-5 year-old's, on the other hand, were so susceptible to change that the phrase used altered their response to future questions. 4-5 year-old's were also less likely to overestimate their knowledge of a target person if the initial question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; Not only can responses from children be altered by the phrasing of the question, but the suggestion of lack of prior experience with the target is enough for children to change their response. In a study where children were asked if they really knew who a specific person was (between 2 pictures of people they had never seen before), they were more accurate in assessing that they ''didn't know'' when it was suggested that the target person had never been to the child's city before.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; While experience is important, children tend not to over-rely on prior experiences and only use it when they've had significant experience that would actually assist them in assessing their knowledge.&lt;ref name= "robinson1994" /&gt;

===Partial information===
Sometimes when confronted with ambiguous information, more than one piece of information is required to make and accurate interpretation. For example, in a study where children had to pick one of four pictures presented to them after hearing ambiguous information, they were capable of making tentative interpretations and then correctly changing their interpretations upon hearing contradicting, clarifying information.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; This strategy uses multiple pieces of information and has been seen in children as young as 15 months old.&lt;ref name="ganea2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganea | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Saylor | first2 = M. M. | year = 2007 | title = Infants' use of shared linguistic information to clarify ambiguous requests | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 493–502 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01011.x | pmid=17381786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where only partial information is available, young children make the best interpretation possible with the information given and go on to change this interpretation only when contradicting information emerges.&lt;ref name="robinson1982" /&gt;

===Delaying interpretation===
The presentation of clarifying information is not always immediately accessible. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Even more difficult than acknowledging that an ambiguous situation has arisen, is children's understanding in what actions they need to take for clarification. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is [[intention]]al and one that is [[instinct]]ual.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; The explicit decision to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the current information is not sufficient, and knowing how to acquire appropriate information necessary for clarification. Children are typically not successful in this process until the age of 7.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; However, when this explicit decision to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; While the ability for intentionally delaying interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children's cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial.

===Referents and meaning===
It is difficult for younger children to grasp the idea that objects can be referred to in different ways and that people can have partial knowledge of the different references (i.e. a "bouncy ball" might also be referred to as a "rubber sphere"). A child might know by looking that a toy is a toy truck, but they may not be aware that the toy truck is also a present. [[Opaque context|Referential opacity]] is the concept of whether or not referring to an object changes its meaning. If something is referentially ''transparent'' (substitution insensitive), altering the [[referent]] term does not alter the meaning, and something that is referentially ''opaque'' (substitution sensitive) means that altering the referent term would alter the meaning. An example of this is a study with a puppet named Heinz.&lt;ref name="robinson2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Apperly | first2 = I. A. | year = 2001 | title = Children's difficulties with partial representations in ambiguous messages and referentially opaque contexts | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(00)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a ball in a box and children are told that Heinz knows that there is a ball in the box but does not know that the ball is a present. Children are then asked substitution-insensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know the ball is a present? – asking, "Does Heinz know the rubber sphere is a present?" ''does not'' alter the meaning of the question) and substitution sensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know there's a present in the box? – asking "Does Heinz know there is a rubber sphere in the box" ''does'' alter the meaning of the question). Regardless of age, substitution-''insensitive'' questions seem to be easier than substitution-''sensitive'' questions. The ability to correctly answer substitution-sensitive questions improves with age.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt; The ability to answer these types of questions is closely related to effectively evaluating ambiguous messages. Success on substitution-insensitive questions is necessary but not sufficient for success on evaluation ambiguous messages. Alternatively, success on substitution-sensitive questions is necessary and sufficient for success at evaluating ambiguous messages.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt;

=== Physical and epistemic uncertainty ===
Children can change their interpretation of information based on the context in which the interpretation is made.&lt;ref name="robinson2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Rowley | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Beck | first3 = S. R. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = D. J. | last5 = Apperly | first5 = I. A. | year = 2006 | title = Children's sensitivity to their own relative ignorance: Handling of possibilities under epistemic and physical uncertainty | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 1642–1655 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00964.x | pmid=17107451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and colleagues (2006) studied children's interpretation of information in two different: physical and epistemic uncertainty. Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4 to 8 year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (''physical uncertainty''), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (''epistemic uncertainty''). Under the conditions of ''epistemic uncertainty'', children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome.&lt;ref name="beck2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = | last2 = McColgan | first2 = K.

J. | last2 = Pendle | first2 = J. | last3 = Rowley | first3 = M. G. | last4 = Beck | first4 = S. R. | last5 = McColgan | first5 = K. L.

=== Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ===
Feeling-of-knowing occurs when people are unable to easily recall a memory or a fact, but they know that they learned it and are able to recognize it, such as in a multiple-choice test.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, T.O., &amp; Narens, L. (1994). Why investigate metacognition? In J. Metcalife &amp;A.P. Shimamura (Eds.), Metacognition. Knowing about knowing (pp. 1–25). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults' accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments is well above chance but not nearly perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koriat | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = How do we know that we know? The accessibility model of the feeling of knowing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 609–639 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to be the same for children as well. Lockl and Schneider (2002) did not find any developmental trends in the accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments. Instead, similar to adults, children's accuracy of feeling-of knowing judgments was low, but still above chance for all age groups studied (grade 1 through grade 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lockl | first1 = K. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = W. | year = 2002 | title = Developmental trends in children's feeling-of-knowing judgments | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 327–333 | doi=10.1080/01650250143000210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting a child to attend to this feeling-of-knowing (through language or prompting of prior experience) is one way to assist them in more accurately assessing their actual knowledge, allowing them to handle ambiguous situations at a much younger age.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt;

==Forensic applications==
Children are highly susceptible to a "[[suggestibility]] effect", producing "[[false memory|false memories]]" and/or "incorrect, post-event information" (see [[misinformation effect]]) when asked to engage in memory recall.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch-Ross | first1 = M.

In order to develop reliable and age-appropriate instruments for interviewing children, it is imperative to consider their cognitive development, verbal and mental abilities.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

===Forensic interviews and techniques===
====Factors that can impact disclosure====
It is critical for a forensic interviewer to recognize their power during an interview, especially with a child witness. An interviewer can impact the course of a child's testimony in numerous ways, including:
* Eliciting "false allegations" through leading and suggestive questions&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Determining the amount of detail a child may disclose&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Prevent a child from disclosing&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Interviewer's gender may also impact the quality and details of disclosure. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 are more likely to disclose to an interviewer of the same gender.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The age of a child is also an important factor during interviewing. Younger children are more likely to provide shorter, less detailed accounts of an event in comparison to older children.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Preschool children are more likely to disclose information in an "accidental way" through triggers and obvious cues, whereas older school children are more likely to make "intentional disclosures" based on the nature of the question they are asked.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Improper interviewing====
There are varying techniques and extraneous factors that can influence the way a child discloses an event during child witness testimony (e.g., experiences of abuse by a parent or caregiver). There are two major types of barriers in forensic interviews: (1) improper interviewing and (2) clumsy interviewing&lt;ref name="wood2000"&gt;Wood, J., &amp; Garven, S. (2000). How sexual abuse interviews go astray: Implications for prosecutors, police and child protection services. ''Child Maltreatment'', 5, 109-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cronch | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Hansen | first3 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Forensic interviewing in child sexual abuse cases: Current techniques and future directions | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behaviour | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 195–207 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Improper interviewing'' includes forensic techniques that are considered to be "risky and ineffective".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Each of the following techniques can create critically negative consequences in witness testimony and result in false allegations or the potential for a reduced conviction:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Use of reinforcement: If an interviewer utilizes rewards and punishments to coerce disclosure&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Social influence: If an interviewer informs a child of another child's disclosure or recollection&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Asking suggestive or leading questions: This can occur when an interviewer provides a child with information that has not been previously known&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Removing the child from direct experience: For example, asking a child "what ''might'' have happened"&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

''Clumsy interviewing'' involves interviews that fail to include best practices and recommended techniques.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Interviewers who are not properly trained in forensic techniques can fail to follow structured interview guidelines and impact the outcome of a child's testimony and/or responses to questioning. This type of interviewing most often occurs when an interviewer lacks skill, forgets important procedures, and when there is a lack of necessary supervision.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

In order to prevent improper forensic interviewing, numerous methods to reduce suggestibility and the misinformation effect have been proven effective, including: taping interviews, recording transcripts, ensuring supervision by a qualified professional, experience in working with children, training in forensic interviewing, and maintaining a comfortable, safe environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Types of interviewing====
The '''''cognitive interview''''' utilizes cognitive theory as a focal point in its interview methodology. The cognitive interview, first developed in 1992 by researchers Fisher and Geiselman, was originally developed for adults and later modified for children. It utilizes two major perspectives from cognitive theory, including the "[[encoding specificity principle]]" and a "multi-component view of memory traces".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

Specifically, this method utilizes four major techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Report everything: i.e., "''tell me everything you remember''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Context reinstatement: i.e., "''think back to where you were at the time''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Reverse order: i.e., "''now that you told me what happened, try to remember it again but this time starting at the end and recounting it in reverse chronological order''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Change perspective: i.e., "''what would the perpetrator have seen and heard?''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol'''''
developed an investigative protocol in 2000 to create a structured interview technique for children, specifically those of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Orbach | first2 = Y. | last3 = Hershkowitz | first3 = I. | last4 = Esplin | first4 = P. W. | last5 = Horowitz | first5 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A structured forensic interview protocol improves the quality and informativeness of investigative interviews with children: A review of research using the NICHD Investigative Protocol | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1201–1231 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.03.021 | pmid=18023872 | pmc=2180422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the following techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007" /&gt;
# Introductory phase: This is necessary for [[rapport]] building&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Practice in free-recall: "''Tell me about your last birthday party''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Information about the ground rules: "''It's okay to say "I don't know"''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Open-ended questions: "''Tell me why you came to talk to me''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Stepwise interview'''''
utilizes open-ended questions through a "funnel-like strategy".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; It is primarily used by legal professionals, and is most often used in North America.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; This interview begins with open-ended questions and/or free recall and slowly incorporates more focused and detailed questions.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Allegation blind interviews'''''
stress that an interviewer should refrain from gathering information prior to an interview in order to reduce suggestibility and increase interviewer patience and attentiveness.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This also enhances the interviewer's ability to be non-judgmental and objective.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Truth-lie discussions'''''
are most useful prior to commencing abuse-related questioning. This method allows the interviewer to create a baseline with the child about what the "truth" is and what a "lie" is.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; The interviewer is encouraged to ask questions with general examples, such as "tell me a lie about this chair".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This strategy has been proven to result in a less misinformed child testimony.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Touch survey'''''
was developed on the basis that "touch falls on a continuum", and is beneficial to screen for child abuse.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; It includes questions surrounding the child's experiences with touch (e.g., kissing, hugging, hitting), including where they have been touched and by whom.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This tool might be more useful when used in conjunction with other forensic strategies.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

===Recommendations for forensic interviewing===
Although there are varying suggestions for structured forensic interviewing, experts provide context into best practices that can significantly reduce suggestibility, false memories and the misinformation effect:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviews should be conducted in a safe, child-friendly environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# A child's age should be considered when being interviewed, and practices should be modified accordingly.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Structured interview protocol should always be utilized.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviewers should engage in professional training when possible.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Ground rules are essential for the beginning of the interview so that the child is aware of the type of responses they can provide (e.g., "I don't know").&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

{{Equitable doctrines}}
'''Clean hands''', sometimes called the '''clean hands doctrine''' or the '''dirty hands doctrine''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/dirty-hands-doctrine.html |title=dirty hands doctrine definition |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Defense (legal)|equitable defense]] in which the [[defendant]] argues that the [[plaintiff]] is not entitled to obtain an [[equitable remedy]] because the plaintiff is acting [[Business ethics|unethically]] or has acted in [[bad faith]] with respect to the subject of the [[complaint]]—that is, with "unclean hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/unclean-hands.htm |title=Unclean Hands definition |publisher=Legal-explanations.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant has the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to show the plaintiff is not acting in good faith. The doctrine is often stated as "those seeking equity must do equity" or "equity must come with clean hands". This is a matter of protocol, characterised by [[A. P. Herbert]] in ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' by his fictional Judge Mildew saying (as Herbert says, "less elegantly"), "A dirty dog will not have justice by the court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncommon Law|edition=1st|date=1935|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|last=Herbert|first=A. P.|authorlink=A. P. Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clean hands doctrine is used in U.S. patent law to deny equitable or legal relief to a patentee that has engaged in improper conduct, such as using the patent to extend monopoly power beyond the claims of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant's unclean hands can also be claimed and proven by the plaintiff to claim other equitable remedies and to prevent that defendant from asserting equitable [[affirmative defense]]s. In other words, 'unclean hands' can be used offensively by the plaintiff as well as defensively by the defendant.  Historically, the doctrine of unclean hands can be traced as far back as the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]].

==Relation to equitable remedies==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[Equitable remedies]] are generally remedies other than the payment of [[damages]].  This would include such remedies as obtaining an [[injunction]], or requiring [[specific performance]] of a contract.  Before the development of the courts of [[Equity (law)|equity]] in [[England]], such remedies were unavailable in the [[common law]] courts, which were usually under the aegis of the local ducal noble, whereas equity flowed from the circuit-riding presence of the King's Chancellor who brought along his retainers to enforce his orders (in this sense, the development of the equity courts was a political effort by the Crown to further limit the power of local nobles).  Such remedies were developed in the equity courts, as the payment of damages was often not a sufficient remedy for a plaintiff in certain circumstances.  For example, if a landowner polluted the land of the neighbor, the common law [[tort]] of [[nuisance]] would only allow the innocent party to recover damages.  [[Common law]] had no remedy that would force the defendant to stop the [[pollution]].  Equity courts developed such a remedy, the injunction, that provided an ongoing bar to the activity that caused the damage, as well as affirmative orders called mandamus which compelled a directed party to do a certain thing (which the Chancellor could enforce while there).  

Equity courts realized that such extraordinary remedies were only justified in extraordinary cases, and would generally not grant such a remedy where damages were sufficient to make the plaintiff whole.  For example, if a car dealership broke a contract of sale and refused to deliver a particular car, which now could only be obtained for $10,000 more than what the plaintiff was willing to pay, the courts would merely award the plaintiff $10,000 (in addition to the original amount paid, if it had already been paid).  It would not force the dealer to obtain exactly the same car and sell it to the plaintiff.  However, if the subject matter of the sale were unique, such as a particular work of art or real estate, the court would order specific performance and require the sale.

However, equity courts also realized that these extraordinary remedies were subject to abuse.  For example, if a doctor had signed a [[non-compete clause]] with a clinic, the non-compete clause might prevent the doctor from earning a living if he left the clinic's employment.  As such, the court will generally only grant these remedies on the strictest terms.  If there is any indication that the plaintiff seeking the remedy had acted in bad faith, either prior to the commencement of the [[litigation]] or afterwards, the court will generally not grant the remedy.  For example, if the doctor left the clinic because it was involved in insurance [[fraud]], a court would most likely refuse to enforce the non-compete agreement by issuing an injunction, although it might allow the clinic to recover damages if they did lose business to the doctor.  Much of the various limitations, often expressed as "maxims of equity", arose from the sheer physical fact that the Chancellor and his enforcers would soon be moving on to another locale, and thus equity tended to be careful in allowing access to its powerful remedies and to order only that which would be quickly or effectively enforced.

'''Compartmental models''' are a technique used to simplify the [[mathematical modelling of infectious disease]]. The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of [[Kermack–McKendrick theory|Kermack and McKendrick in 1927]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |pages=700–721 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyse.

Compartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.

==The SIR model==

The '''SIR model''' is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments– '''S''' for the number '''s'''usceptible, '''I''' for the number of '''i'''nfectious, and '''R''' for the number '''r'''ecovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].
[[File:SIR model simulated using python.gif|thumb|Spatial SIR model simulation. Each cell can infect its eight immediate neighbors.]]

These variables ('''S''', '''I''', and '''R''') represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of ''t'' (time): '''S'''(''t''), '''I'''(''t'') and '''R'''(''t''). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.

===The SIR model is dynamic in three senses===

As implied by the variable function of ''t'', the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease with a short infectious period, such as [[measles]] in the UK prior to the introduction of a [[vaccination|vaccine]] in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(''t'')) over time. During an [[epidemic]], the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.
[[File:Sirsys-p9.png|thumb|Blue=Susceptible, Green=Infected, and Red=Recovered]]
Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. This can be shown as a flow diagram in which the boxes represent the different compartments and the arrows the transition between compartments, i.e.
[[File:SIR.PNG|center|frameless|220x220px]]

===Transition rates===

For the full specification of the model, the arrows should be labeled with the transition rates between compartments. Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.

Between I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or death). If the duration of the infection is denoted ''D'', then γ = 1/''D'', since an individual experiences one recovery in ''D'' units of time.

It's assumed that the permanence of each single subject in the epidemic states is a random variable with exponential distribution. More complex and realistic distributions (such as [[Erlang distribution]]) can be equally used with few modifications.

==Bio-mathematical deterministic treatment of the SIR model==

===The SIR model without vital dynamics===

The dynamics of an epidemic, for example the [[Influenza|flu]], are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models.  The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary [[differential equations]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hethcote H |title=The Mathematics of Infectious Diseases |journal=SIAM Review |volume=42  |issue= 4|pages=599–653 |year=2000 |url=http://leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/2000SiamRev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta I S}{N} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta I S}{N}- \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;.

This model was for the first time proposed by O. Kermack and [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]] as a special case of what we now call [[Kermack-McKendrick theory]], and followed work McKendrick had done with [[Ronald Ross]].

This system is [[non-linear]], and does not admit a generic [[analytic solution]]. Nevertheless, significant results can be derived analytically, and with Monte Carlo methods, such as the [[Gillespie algorithm]].

Firstly note that from:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt}  = 0  &lt;/math&gt;,

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = \textrm{Constant} = N  &lt;/math&gt;,

expressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.

Secondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;,
the so-called [[basic reproduction number]] (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible.&lt;ref name=Bailey1975&gt;{{cite book |author=Bailey, Norman T. J. |title=The mathematical theory of infectious diseases and its applications |publisher=Griffin |location=London |year=1975 |isbn=0-85264-231-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn2006&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sonia Altizer |author2=Nunn, Charles |title=Infectious diseases in primates: behavior, ecology and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-856585-2 |series=Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is &lt;math&gt; T_{c} = \beta^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the typical time until recovery is &lt;math&gt; T_{r} = \gamma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others ''before'' the infected has recovered is: &lt;math&gt; T_{r}/T_{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

By dividing the first differential equation by the third, [[Separation of variables|separating the variables]] and integrating we get
:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-R_0(R(t) - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;,
(where &lt;math&gt;S(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R(0)&lt;/math&gt; are the initial numbers of, respectively, susceptible and removed subjects). Thus, in the limit &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the proportion of recovered individuals obeys the following [[transcendental equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\infty} = N - S(0)e^{-R_0(R_{\infty} - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;.
This equation shows that at the end of an epidemic, unless &lt;math&gt;S(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, not all individuals of the population have recovered, so some must remain susceptible. This means that the end of an epidemic is caused by the decline in the number of infected individuals rather than an absolute lack of susceptible subjects.
The role of the [[basic reproduction number]] is extremely important. In fact, upon rewriting the equation for infectious individuals as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = (R_0 S/N  - 1) \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,
it yields that if:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &gt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &gt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., there will be a proper epidemic outbreak with an increase of the number of the  infectious (which can reach a considerable fraction of the population). On the contrary, if
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &lt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &lt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., independently from the initial size of the susceptible population the disease can never cause a proper epidemic outbreak. As a consequence, it is clear that the [[basic reproduction number]]  is extremely important.

===The force of infection===

Note that in the above model the function:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta I ,&lt;/math&gt;

models the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta \frac{I}{N} .&lt;/math&gt;

Capasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.

===Exact analytical solutions to the SIR model===
In 2014, Harko T. et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harko T., Lobo F.S.N., and Mak M.K. |title=Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates. |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation |volume=236 |pages=184–194 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an exact analytical solution to the SIR model. In the without vital dynamics setup, for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)=S(t)&lt;/math&gt;, etc., it corresponds to the following time parametrization

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)= S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u)= N -R(0) + \rho \ln(u)-S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(u)=R(0) -\rho \ln(u)&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t= \int_u^1 \frac{N}{\beta s(N -R(0)+\rho \ln (s)-S(0)s)} ds&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\gamma N}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, with initial conditions &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{S}(1),\mathcal{I}(1),\mathcal{R}(1))=(S(0),N -R(0)-S(0),R(0));&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;u&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u_T)=0&lt;/math&gt;. By the transcendental equation for &lt;math&gt;R_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; above, it follows that &lt;math&gt;u_T=e^{-(R_{\infty}-R(0))/\rho}(=S_{\infty}/S(0)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S(0) \neq 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{\infty}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent analytical solution was found by Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = A note on the derivation of epidemic final sizes | journal = Bulletin of Mathematical Biology | volume = 74 | year=2012 | at= section 4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = Mathematical models of SIR disease spread with combined non-sexual and sexual transmission routes | journal = Infectious Disease Modelling | volume = 2 | year=2017 | at = section 2.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-\xi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(t) = N-S(t)-R(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R(t) = R(0) + N\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \xi(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \xi(t) = \frac{\beta \int_0^t I(t^*) \, dt^*}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\xi(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the expected number of transmissions an individual has received by time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The two solutions are related by &lt;math&gt;e^{-\xi(t)} = u&lt;/math&gt;.

Effectively the same result can be found in the original work by Kermack and McKendrick &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118 | at = pg 713}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===The SIR model with vital dynamics and constant population===
Considering a population characterized by a death rate &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and birth rate &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and where a communicable disease is spreading. The model with mass-action transmission is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \Lambda - \mu S - \beta I S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I S - \gamma I -\mu I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R &lt;/math&gt;

for which the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) =\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, we can derive a [[basic reproduction number]] :
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{ \beta\Lambda }{\mu(\mu+\gamma)}, &lt;/math&gt;
which has threshold properties. In fact, independently from biologically meaningful initial values, one can show that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{DFE} = \left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{EE} = \left(\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta},\frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0-1\right),\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \left(R_0-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The point EE is called the Endemic Equilibrium. With heuristic arguments, one may show that &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; may be read as the average number of infections caused by a single infectious subject in a wholly susceptible population, the above relationship biologically means that if this number is less or equal than one the disease goes extinct, whereas if this number is greater than one the disease will remain permanently endemic in the population.

==The SIS model==
[[File:Sissys.png|thumb|Susceptibles and infected get equilibrated.]]
Some infections, for example those from the [[common cold]] and [[influenza]], do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, and individuals become susceptible again.

[[File:SIS.PNG|400px|center|SIS compartmental model]]

We have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N} + \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;

Note that denoting with N the total population it holds that:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow S(t)+I(t) = N&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \left( \beta N - \gamma\right)  I - \beta I^2 &lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the dynamics of infectious is ruled by a logistic equation, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall I(0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} \le 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=0  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} &gt; 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=\frac{\beta N - \gamma}{\beta}  &lt;/math&gt;

Fortunately, it is possible to find an analytical solution to this model (by making a transformation of variables: &lt;math&gt;I = y^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and substituting this into the mean-field equations),&lt;ref name=Hethcote1989&gt;{{cite book |author=Hethcote, H. W. |title=in Three Basic Epidemiological Models, Applied Mathematical Ecology, Vol. 18 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the basic reproduction rate is greater than unity. The solution is given as
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{I_\infty}{1+V e^{-\chi(t-t_0)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_\infty = (\beta N -\gamma)/\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the endemic infected population, &lt;math&gt;\chi = \gamma-\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V = I_\infty/I_0 - 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the system is assumed to be closed, the susceptible population is then &lt;math&gt;S(t) = N - I(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Elaborations on the basic SIR model==

===The MSIR model===

For many infections, including [[measles]], babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies (passed across the [[placenta]] and additionally through [[colostrum]]). This is called [[passive immunity]]. This added detail can be shown by including an M class (for maternally derived immunity) at the beginning of the model

[[File:MSIR.PNG|800px|center|MSIR compartmental model]]To indicate this mathematically, an additional compartment is added, M(t), which results in the following differential equations:
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \beta SI - \gamma I - \mu I&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT} = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

===Carrier state===

Some people who have had an infectious disease such as [[tuberculosis]] never completely recover and continue to [[asymptomatic carrier|carry]] the infection, whilst not suffering the disease themselves. They may then move back into the infectious compartment and suffer symptoms (as in tuberculosis) or they may continue to infect others in their carrier state, while not suffering symptoms. The most famous example of this is probably [[Mary Mallon]], who infected 22 people with [[typhoid fever]]. The carrier compartment is labelled C.

[[File:SIR model with carrier.PNG|500px|center|SIR compartmental model with carrier class, C]]

===The SEIR model===

For many important infections there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed).

[[File:SEIR.PNG|800px|center|SEIR compartmental model]]

Assuming that the incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with
parameter a (i.e. the average incubation period is &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), and also assuming the presence of vital dynamics with birth rate equal to death rate, we have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu +a ) E &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = a E - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R. &lt;/math&gt;

We have &lt;math&gt;S+E+I+R=N&lt;/math&gt;, but this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal; in general &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a variable.

For this model, the basic reproduction number is:

&lt;math&gt;R_0 = \frac{a}{\mu+a}\frac{\beta}{\mu+\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly to the SIR model, also in this case we have a Disease-Free-Equilibrium (N,0,0,0) and an Endemic Equilibrium EE, and one can show that, independently form biologically meaningful initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt; \left(S(0),E(0),I(0),R(0)\right) \in \left\{(S,E,I,R)\in [0,N]^4 : S \ge 0, E \ge 0, I\ge 0, R\ge 0, S+E+I+R = N \right\}   &lt;/math&gt;

it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0,0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = EE. &lt;/math&gt;

In case of periodically varying contact rate &lt;math&gt;\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt; the condition for the global attractiveness of DFE is that the following linear system with periodic coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE_1}{dt} = \beta(t) I_1 - (\gamma +a ) E_1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI_1}{dt} = a E_1 - (\gamma +\mu ) I_1 &lt;/math&gt;
is stable (i.e. it has its Floquet's eigenvalues inside the unit circle in the complex plane).

=== The SEIS model ===
The SEIS model takes into consideration the exposed or latent period of the disease, giving an additional compartment, E(t).
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;
In this model an infection does not leave any immunity thus individuals that have recovered return to being susceptible again, moving back into the ''S''(''t'') compartment.  The following differential equations describe this model:
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = B - \beta SI - \mu S + \gamma I&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT} = \beta SI - (\epsilon + \mu)E&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIR model ===
For the case of a disease, with the factors of passive immunity, and a latency period there is the MSEIR model.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT}  = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT}  = \beta SI - (\varepsilon + \mu)E &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT}  = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT}  = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIRS model ===
An MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Variable contact rates and pluriannual or chaotic epidemics===
It is well known that the probability of getting a disease is not constant in the time. Some diseases are seasonal, such as the [[Coronavirus|common cold viruses]], which are more prevalent during winter.  With childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, there is a strong correlation with the school calendar, so that during the school holidays the probability of getting such a disease dramatically decreases.

As a consequence, for many classes of diseases one should consider a force of infection with periodically ('seasonal') varying contact rate
:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} , \beta(t+T)=\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt;
with period T equal to one year.

Thus, our model becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

(the dynamics of recovered easily follows from &lt;math&gt;R=N-S-I&lt;/math&gt;), i.e. a nonlinear set of differential equations with periodically varying parameters. It is well known that this class of dynamical systems may undergo very interesting and complex phenomena of  nonlinear parametric resonance. It is easy to see that if:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}\frac{\beta(t)}{\mu+\gamma}dt  &lt; 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0\right), &lt;/math&gt;

whereas if the integral is greater than one the disease will not die out and there may be such resonances. For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.
This allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the pseudo-period of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.
Remarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.

==Modelling vaccination==
The SIR model can be modified to model vaccination. Typically these introduce an additional compartment to the SIR model, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, for vaccinated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chauhan|first=Sudipa|last2=Misra|first2=Om Prakash|last3=Dhar|first3=Joydip|date=2014|title=Stability Analysis of SIR Model with Vaccination|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ajcam.20140401.03.html#Sec3|journal=American Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|issn=2165-8943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples.

===Vaccinating newborns===
In presence of a communicable diseases, one of main tasks is that of eradicating it via  prevention measures and, if possible, via the establishment of a mass vaccination program. Let us consider a disease for which the newborn are vaccinated (with a vaccine giving lifelong immunity) at a rate &lt;math&gt;P \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu+\gamma)  I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the class of vaccinated subjects. It is immediate to show that:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} V(t)= N P,&lt;/math&gt;

thus we shall deal with the long term behavior of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, for which it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N \left(1-P\right),0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = EE = \left(\frac{N}{R_0(1-P)},N \left(R_0 (1-P)-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if
:&lt;math&gt; P &lt; P^{*}= 1-\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;
the vaccination program is not successful in eradicating the disease, on the contrary it will remain endemic, although at lower levels than the case of absence of vaccinations. This means that the mathematical model suggests that for a disease whose [[basic reproduction number]] may be as high as 18 one should have to vaccinate 94.4% of newborns in order to eradicate the disease.

===Vaccination and information===
Modern societies are facing the challenge of "rational" exemption, i.e. the family's decision to not vaccinate children as a consequence of a "rational" comparison between the perceived risk from infection and that from getting damages from the vaccine. In order to assess whether this behavior is really rational, i.e. if it can equally lead to the eradication of the disease,  one may simply assume that the vaccination rate is an increasing function of the number of infectious subjects:
:&lt;math&gt; P=P(I),P^{\prime}(I)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In such a case the eradication condition becomes:
:&lt;math&gt; P(0) \ge P^{*},&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the baseline vaccination rate should be greater than the "mandatory vaccination" threshold, which, in case of exemption, cannot hold. Thus, "rational" exemption might be myopic since it is based only on the current low incidence due to high vaccine coverage, instead taking into account future resurgence of infection due to coverage decline.

===Vaccination of non newborns===
In case there also are vaccinations of non newborn at a rate ρ the equation for the susceptible and vaccinated subject has to be modified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \rho S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P + \rho S - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

leading to the following eradication condition:

:&lt;math&gt; P \ge 1- \left(1+\frac{\rho}{\mu}\right)\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Pulse vaccination strategy===
This strategy repeatedly vaccinates a defined age-cohort (such as young children or the elderly) in a susceptible population over time. Using this strategy, the block of susceptible individuals is then immediately removed, making it possible to eliminate an infectious disease, (such as measles), from the entire population. Every T time units a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects is vaccinated in a relatively short (with respect to the dynamics of the disease) time. This leads to the following impulsive differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that by setting {{math|1=''I'' = 0}} one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; S^*(t) = 1- \frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}  &lt;/math&gt;

and that the eradication condition is:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \int_{0}^{T}{S^*(t)dt} &lt; 1  &lt;/math&gt;

==The influence of age: age-structured models==
Age has a deep influence on the disease spread rate in a population, especially the contact rate. This rate summarizes the effectiveness of contacts between susceptible and infectious subjects. Taking into account the ages of the epidemic classes &lt;math&gt;s(t,a),i(t,a),r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt; (to limit ourselves to the susceptible-infectious-removed scheme) such that:

:&lt;math&gt;S(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{s(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{i(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{r(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;a_M \le +\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum admissible age)and their dynamics is not described, as one might think, by "simple" partial differential equations, but by [[integro-differential equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t s(t,a) + \partial_a s(t,a) = -\mu(a) s(a,t) - s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t i(t,a) + \partial_a i(t,a) =  s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}  -\mu(a) i(a,t) - \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t r(t,a) + \partial_a r(t,a) =   -\mu(a) r(a,t) + \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t,i(\cdot,\cdot))=\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}&lt;/math&gt;

is the force of infection, which, of course, will depend, though the contact kernel &lt;math&gt; k(a,a_1;t) &lt;/math&gt; on the interactions between the ages.

Complexity is added by the initial conditions for newborns (i.e. for a=0), that are straightforward for infectious and removed:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t,0)=r(t,0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

but that are nonlocal for the density of susceptible newborns:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t,0)= \int_{0}^{a_M}{\left(\varphi_s(a) s(a,t)+\varphi_i(a) i(a,t)+\varphi_r(a) r(a,t)\right) da} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_j(a), j=s,i,r&lt;/math&gt; are the fertilities of the adults.

Moreover, defining now the density of the total population &lt;math&gt;n(t,a)=s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt;  one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t n(t,a) + \partial_a n(t,a) = -\mu(a) n(a,t) &lt;/math&gt;

In the simplest case of equal fertilities in the three epidemic classes, we have that in oder to have demographic equilibrium the following necessary and sufficient condition linking the fertility &lt;math&gt;\varphi(.)&lt;/math&gt; with the mortality &lt;math&gt;\mu(a)&lt;/math&gt; must hold:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = \int_0^{a_M}{\varphi(a) \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq} \right)da } &lt;/math&gt;

and the demographic equilibrium is

:&lt;math&gt;n^*(a)=C \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

automatically ensuring the existence of the disease-free solution:

:&lt;math&gt;DFS(a)= \left(n^*(a),0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of an appropriate functional operator.

== Other considerations within compartmental epidemic models ==

=== Vertical transmission ===
In the case of some diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B, it is possible for the offspring of infected parents to be born infected.  This transmission of the disease down from the mother is called Vertical Transmission.  The influx of additional members into the infected category can be considered within the model by including a fraction of the newborn members in the infected compartment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brauer, F. &amp; Castillo-Chávez, C. (2001).  ''Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology.''  NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector transmission ===
Diseases transmitted from human to human indirectly, i.e. malaria spread by way of mosquitoes, are transmitted through a vector.  In these cases, the infection transfers from human to insect and an epidemic model must include both species, generally requiring many more compartments than a model for direct transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For more information on this type of model see the reference ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', by R. M. Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. M. ed. (1982)  ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', Chapman and Hall, London-New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Other occurrences which may need to be considered when modeling an epidemic include things such as the following:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
:•	Nonhomogeneous mixing
:•	Variable infectivity
:•	Distributions that are spatially non-uniform
:•	Diseases caused by macroparasites

==Deterministic versus stochastic epidemic models==
It is important to stress that the deterministic models presented here are valid only in case of sufficiently large populations, and as such should be used cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett MS |title=Measles periodicity and community size |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A |volume=120 |pages=48–70 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2342553 |issue=1 |jstor=2342553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more precise, these models are only valid in the [[thermodynamic limit]], where the population is effectively infinite. In stochastic models, the long-time endemic equilibrium derived above, does not hold, as there is a finite probability that the number of infected individuals drops below one in a system. In a true system then, the pathogen may not propagate, as no host will be infected. But, in deterministic mean-field models, the number of infecteds can take on real, namely, non-integer values of infected hosts, and the pathogen may still persist in the system with a finite number of infected hosts, less than one but greater than zero.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Consensus reality'''&lt;ref&gt;"Reality by Consensus": An Analysis of the Metapragmatic and Therapeutic Dimensions of Vampiric Live Action Role-playing. Reviews Indiana University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Consciousness. By Lily Splane. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gnjxnq7ZRTAC&amp;pg=PA51 Pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; is that which is generally agreed to be [[reality]], based on a [[consensus]] view.

The appeal to consensus arises from the fact that humans do not fully understand or agree upon the nature of [[knowledge]] or [[ontology]], often making it uncertain what is real, given the vast inconsistencies between individual [[subjectivity|subjectivities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind |last=Lakoff |first=George |authorlink=George Lakoff |year=1987 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-46804-6 |pages=259 |quote=In summary, Putnam has shown that existing formal versions of objectivist ''epistemology'' are inconsistent; there can be no objectively correct ''description'' of reality from a God's eye point of view. This does not, of course, mean that there is no objective reality—only that we have no ''privileged access'' to it from an external viewpoint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason, Truth, and History |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam |year=1981 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real. We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more "practical" than perceived alternatives. Consensus reality therefore refers to the agreed-upon concepts of reality which people in the world, or a culture or group, believe are real (or treat as real), usually based upon their common experiences as they believe them to be; anyone who does not agree with these is sometimes stated to be "in effect... living in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David G., editor |last=Stork |title=Hal's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and Reality |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-69211-2 |page=201 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history this has also raised a social question as to the effects of a society in which all individuals do not agree upon the same reality.

Children have sometimes been described or viewed as "inexperience[d] with consensus reality,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Rostow Kuznets |title=When Toys Come Alive: Narratives of Animation, Metamorphosis, and Development |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05645-1 |pages=228, note 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.

==General discussion==
In considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the [[philosophical realism|realist]] approach, in which there is a single, [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the [[philosophy of perception|perceptions]] of any given individual, and the [[idealism|idealistic]] approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own ''[[experience]]'' of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.

Consensus reality may be understood by studying [[socially constructed reality]], a subject within the [[sociology of knowledge]]. (Read page three of ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]].)

Consider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of [[science]] alone, for explaining life and the [[universe]].

In societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality, while the religious worldview would remain the non-consensus (or alternative) reality in a predominantly [[secular]] society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone.

In this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different [[world view]]s,&lt;ref name="ken_wilber_1"&gt;According to philosopher [[Ken Wilber]]. See Ken Wilber's book ''A Brief History of Everything''.&lt;/ref&gt; with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as [[science]], [[slavery]], and [[human sacrifice]] may differ in direct consequence because of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.

==In science and philosophy==
{{See also|Scientific consensus}}

===Idealists===
Some [[idealists]] ([[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]]) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's [[private language argument | personal reality]] is unique. Such idealists have the [[world view]] which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=subjective+idealism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7ivm4kIrZAhVHWqwKHb5BBfsQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kantian Reason and Hegelian Spirit: The Idealistic Logic of Modern Theology|last=Dorrien|first=Gary|date=2015-03-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119016540|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialists===
[[Materialists]] may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one [[reality]]. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered [[delusion]]al.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Social consequences==

===Views on the term===
The [[connotation]] of the term "consensus reality" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by [[idealist]], [[surrealist]] and other [[anti-realist]] [[theorist]]s opposing or hostile to this "reality," with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase "consensus reality" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zane Crawford |title=ideotrope: consensus reality |url=https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103508/https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social aspects===
Singers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Scott |first=Aaron |title=Angel in America: Holcombe Waller's seraphic voice provides comfort during ''Troubled Times'' |newspaper=[[Just Out]] (Portland, Oregon) |volume=22 |issue=20 |page=37 |date=August 19, 2005 |url=http://www.holcombewaller.com/PressContent/JustOut0805.jpg |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; painters, writers, theorists and other individuals employing a number of means of action have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are "ignoring" it. For example, [[Salvador Dalí]] intended by his paranoiac-critical method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DALI.UFFS.NET - Salvador Dali - Odjinud ... |url=http://dali.uffs.net/ascii/napsali/1990eyer.html |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407043059/http://dali.uffs.net/ascii/napsali/1990eyer.html |archivedate=2007-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bryan M.

'''Conservation-reliant species''' are animal or plant [[species]] that require continuing species-specific [[wildlife management]] intervention such as [[Hunting#Wildlife management|predator control]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] and [[Pest control|parasite control]] to survive, even when a self-sustainable recovery in population is achieved.&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncseonline.org/Conference/Biodiversity/cms.cfm?id=2396 |title=Endangered Species and Other Conservation Reliant Species |last=J.

== History ==

The term "conservation-reliant species" grew out of the [[conservation biology]] undertaken by ''The Endangered Species Act at Thirty Project'' (launched 2001)&lt;ref name="Goble"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goble |first=Dale |author2=J. Michael Scott |author3=Frank W. Davis |title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty: Renewing the Conservation Promise |publisher=Island Press |year=2006 |volume=I |pages=xii, 299 |isbn=978-1-59726-009-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vEh7m1k5WMwC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=%22conservation+reliant+species%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularization by project leader [[J. Michael Scott]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=J. Michael |date=Jan 2007 |title=AOU Conservation Award, 2006 |journal=The Auk |publisher=The American Ornithologists' Union |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=353–355 |issn=0004-8038 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1642/0004-8038%282007%29124%5B353%3AACA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[353:ACA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first use in a formal publication was in ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Worldwide use of the term has not yet developed and it has not yet appeared in a publication compiled outside North America.&lt;!--?: &lt;ref&gt;Note: See publication information of article references.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Passages of the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) carried with it the assumption that endangered species would be delisted as their populations recovered. It assumed they would then thrive under existing regulations and the protections afforded under the ESA would no longer be needed. However, eighty percent of [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|species currently listed]] under the ESA fail to meet that assumption. To survive, they require species-specific conservation interventions (e.g. control of predators, competitors, nest parasites, prescribed burns, altered hydrological processes, etc.) and thus they are conservation-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/information_page.html Conservation Reliant Species: Our New Relationship with Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

The criteria for assessing whether a species is conservation-reliant are:&lt;ref name="Scott1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/conservation_reliant_species.pdf |title=Conservation Reliant Species:Our New Relationship with Nature? |last=Scott |first=J. Michael Scott |author2=Dale Goble |author3=Aaron Haines |date=August 21, 2008 |work=CSP3900 Conservation Science Web Conference Series |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Threats to the species’ continued existence are known and treatable.
# The threats are pervasive and recurrent, for example: nest parasites, non-native [[predator]]s, human disturbance.
# The threats render the species at risk of [[extinction]], absent ongoing conservation management.
# Management actions sufficient to counter threats have been identified and can be implemented, for example: [[controlled burn|prescribed fires]], restrictions on grazing or public access, predator or parasite control.
# National, state or local governments, often in cooperation with private or tribal interests, are capable of carrying out the necessary management actions as long as necessary.

== Management actions ==

There are five major areas of management action for conservation of vulnerable species:
# Control of other species may include: control of [[Introduced species#Introduced animals|exotic fauna]], [[Introduced species#Introduced plants|exotic flora]], other native species and [[parasite]]s and [[disease]].
# Control of direct human impacts may include control of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|grazing]], human access, on and [[off-road vehicle]]s, low impact [[recreation]] and illegal collecting and [[poaching]].
# Pollution control may include control of chemical [[Surface runoff|run-off]], [[siltation]], [[water quality]] and use of [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.
# Active [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] may include [[Wildfire suppression|fire management and control]], control of [[Erosion|soil erosion]] and [[waterbody|waterbodies]], habitat [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] and [[Weed control#Organic methods|mechanical vegetation control]].
# Artificial population recruitment may include captive propagation (forced immigration) or [[captive breeding]].&lt;ref name="Scott1"/&gt;

== Case study ==
[[File:Indian Tiger.jpg|thumb|225px|Bengal tiger at [[Bannerghatta National Park]], Bangalore, India.]]

A prominent example is in [[India]], where [[Bengal tiger|tigers]], an [[apex predator]] and the national animal, are considered a conservation-reliant species. This [[keystone species]] can maintain self-sustaining wild populations; however, they require ongoing management actions because threats are pervasive, recurrent and put them at risk of extinction. The origin of these threats are rooted in the changing socio-economic, political and spatial organization of society in India. Tigers have become extinct in some areas because of extrinsic factors such as habitat destruction, poaching, disease, floods, fires and drought, decline of prey species for the same reasons, as well as intrinsic factors such as demographic [[stochastic]]ity and [[genetic deterioration]].

Recognizing the conservation reliance of tigers, [[Project Tiger]] is establishing a national science-based framework for monitoring tiger population trends in order to manage the species more effectively. India now has 28 tiger reserves, located in 17 states. These reserves cover {{convert|37761|km2|sqmi}} including 1.14% of the total land area of the country. These reserves are kept free of biotic disturbances, forestry operations, collection of minor forest products, grazing and human disturbance. The populations of tigers in these reserves now constitute some of the most important tiger source populations in the country.&lt;ref name="Maraj"&gt;{{cite web |last=R Maraj, J Seidensticker |title=Assessment of a Framework for Monitoring Tiger Population Trends in India |url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/Assessment%20of%20a%20framework%20for%20monitoring%20tiger%20population%20trends%20in%20India-%202006.pdf |year=2006 |work=A Report to the IUCN: World Conservation Union and India's Project Tiger |publisher=Govt. of India, Project Tiger |pages=7–9 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==

The magnitude and pace of human impacts on the environment make it unlikely that substantial progress will be made in delisting many species unless the definition of "recovery" includes some form of active management. Preventing delisted species from again being at risk of extinction may require continuing, species-specific management actions. Viewing "recovery" of  "conservation-reliant species" as a continuum of phases rather a simple "recovered/not recovered" status may enhance the ability to manage such species within the framework of the Endangered Species Act. With ongoing loss of habitat, disruption of natural cycles, increasing impacts of non-native invasive species, it is probable that the number of conservation-reliant species will increase.

It has been proposed that development of "recovery management agreements", with legally and biologically defensible contracts would provide for continuing conservation management following delisting. The use of such formalized agreements will facilitate shared management responsibilities between federal wildlife agencies and other federal agencies, and with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as with private entities that have demonstrated the capability to meet the needs of conservation-reliant species.&lt;ref name="Scott2"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=Recovery of imperiled species under the Endangered Species Act: The need for a new approach |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |publisher=ProQuest-CSA |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=383–89 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7326616&amp;q=%22conservation+reliant+species%22&amp;uid=1014961&amp;setcookie=yes |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0383:ROISUT]2.0.CO;2 |last1=Scott |first1=J Michael |last2=Goble |first2=Dale D. |last3=Wiens |first3=John A. |last4=Wilcove |first4=David S. |last5=Bean |first5=Michael |last6=Male |first6=Timothy |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
''Death by a Thousand Cuts'' investigates the use of [[slow slicing]] or ''lingchi'', a form of torture and capital punishment practised in mid- and late-Imperial China from the tenth century until its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="HarvardBlurb"/&gt; ''Lingchi'' involved repeatedly slicing the [[convict]]'s flesh beyond the point of death.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"&gt;{{cite web

By the time of the final imperial dynasty, the punishment could be meted out for an offence as simple as striking a teacher.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

The authors argue that this was more than a physical punishment, as the victim was [[Sedative|sedated]] with [[opium]] and killed early in the process, but about denying the victim "somatic integrity"&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SomaticIntegrity"&gt;Somatic integrity: the vital capacity to be whole as an organism, which would be denied if the body were cut into pieces.&lt;/ref&gt; and denying them any hope of a [[Afterlife|life after death]] which, the authors argue, caused them to feel [[shame]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

==Reception==
A staff reviewer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' describes the book as a "fascinating study".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

A staff reviewer at ''[[The Times]]'' states that "the authors present a nuanced picture of state-imposed execution and, without at any time condoning, succeed in their goal of contextualising ''lingchi'' in relation to Western forms of punishment" and that "this challenging and important work will appeal not solely to [[Sinology|Sinologists]],&lt;ref name="Sinology"&gt;Sinology: the study of China  and things related to China.&lt;/ref&gt; but to [[Legal history|legal historians]] and students of visual representation."&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

Jonathan Mirsky in ''[[Literary Review]]'' writes that "[the authors] write coolly and formally, but this is a book primarily about torment."&lt;ref name="LiteraryReview"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Dialectica spaces''' are a [[category theory|categorical]] way of constructing  models of [[linear logic]].

They were introduced by [[Valeria de Paiva]], [[Martin Hyland]]'s student, in her doctoral thesis, as a way of modeling both linear logic and [[Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]]&amp;mdash;hence the name.

Given a [[category (category theory)|category]] ''C'' and a specific object ''K'' of ''C'' with certain (logical) properties, one can construct the category of Dialectica spaces over ''C'', whose objects are  pairs of objects of ''C'',  related by a ''C''-[[morphism]] into the given object. Morphisms of Dialectica spaces are similar to [[Chu space]] morphisms, but instead of an equality condition, they have an inequality condition, which is read as a [[logical consequence|logical implication]], the first object implies the second.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13585">"'''Drinking the Kool-Aid'''" is an expression commonly used in the United States that refers to a person who believes in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards.  The phrase often carries a negative connotation.  It can also be used ironically or humorously to refer to accepting an idea or changing a preference due to popularity, peer pressure, or persuasion.  In recent years it has evolved further to mean extreme dedication to a cause or purpose, so extreme that one would "Drink the Kool-Aid" and die for the cause.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Background==
{{main|Jonestown#Deaths in Jonestown}}
On November 18, 1978, Jones ordered that the members of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Leo Ryan]]'s party be killed after several defectors chose to leave with the party. Residents of the commune later committed suicide by drinking a flavored beverage laced with [[potassium cyanide]]; some were forced to drink it, some (such as small children) drank it unknowingly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 918 people died.

Descriptions of the event often refer to the beverage not as [[Kool-Aid]] but as Flavor Aid,&lt;ref name="Zorn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2008/11/have-you-drunk-the-kool-aid-kool-aid.html|title=''Change of Subject,'' "Have you drunk the 'Kool Aid' Kool Aid |accessdate=2009-08-27 |author=Eric Zorn |date=2008-11-18 |publisher=Chicago Tribune, www.chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a less-expensive product reportedly found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Charles A. |last=Krause |title=Jonestown Is an Eerie Ghost Town Now |newspaper=Washington Post|date=Dec 17, 1978|quote=Along the muddy path that served as a sidewalk for much of the commune, other reminders of the life and death that were Jonestown lie half buried in the fertile soil. A pair of woman's eyeglasses, a towel, a pair of shorts, packets of unopened Flavor-Aid lie scattered about waiting for the final cleanup that may one day return Jonestown to the tidy, if overcrowded, little community it once was.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraft Foods]], the maker of Kool-Aid, has stated the same.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/92/debunk.html |title=Don't Drink the Grape-Flavored Sugar Water... |accessdate=2009-08-27 | author=Kihn, Martin|date=2007-12-19 |publisher=Fast Company|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407051630/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/92/debunk.html|archivedate=7 April 2005}}

Others are less categorical.&lt;ref name="Zorn"/&gt; Both brands are known to have been among the commune's supplies: Film footage shot inside the compound prior to the events of November shows Jones opening a large chest in which boxes of both Flavor Aid and Kool-Aid are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Nelson, Stanley|year= 2006|title= Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZjfWuTHe0M&amp;feature=fvsr#t=9m51s |format= |medium= DVD|language= |trans_title= |publisher= PBS Home Video|location= Hollywood, California|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal investigators testifying at the Jonestown inquest spoke of finding packets of  "cool aid" (''[[sic]]''), and eyewitnesses to the incident are also recorded as speaking of "cool aid" or "Cool Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GuyanaInquest.pdf |title=Guyana inquest |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether they intended to refer to the actual Kool-Aid–brand drink or were [[Genericized trademark|using the name in a generic sense]] that might refer to any powdered flavored beverage.

Given that both were available and are functionally very similar, it is hard to distinguish whether just one or both brands were used. The group had engaged in many "dry runs" using unpoisoned drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Utopian nightmare.

In December 1978, Rev. Dr. [[William Sloane Coffin]] told a convention of the American unit of Pax Christi that American planning for nuclear war and preparations for civil defense was "the Kool-Aid drill without the cyanide."&lt;ref&gt;Hyer, Marjorie. Pax Christi Group Opposes SALT II. 9 December 1978. Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to academician Rebecca Moore, early analogies to Jonestown and Kool-Aid were based around death and suicide, not blind obedience.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16584 Drinking the Kool-Aid: The Cultural Transformation of a Tragedy], Rebecca Moore, American Academy of Religion/ Western Region, St. Mary’s College of California, 26 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest such example she found, via a [[Lexis-Nexis]] search, was a 1982 statement from [[Lane Kirkland]], then head of the [[AFL-CIO]], which described [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policies as "Jonestown economics," which "administers Kool-Aid to the poor, the deprived and the unemployed."&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

In 1984, a Reagan administration appointee, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., chairman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], was quoted as criticizing civil rights leaders [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Vernon Jordan Jr.]], and [[Benjamin Hooks]] by making an analogy between allegiance to "the black leadership" and blind obedience to the Jonestown leaders: "We refuse to be led into another political Jonestown as we were led during the Presidential campaign. No more Kool-Aid, Jesse, Vernon and Ben. We want to be free."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/20/us/criticism-of-black-leaders.html |title=Criticism of Black Leaders |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 20, 1984 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Jack Solerwitz, a lawyer for many of the air traffic controllers who lost their jobs in the 1981 [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|PATCO]] strike, explained his dedication to their cause in spite of the substantial personal financial losses he incurred by saying: "I was the only lawyer who kept the doors open for them, and I thought I'd get a medal for it... Instead, I was the one who drank the Kool-Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/20/us/law-bar-lawyer-for-striking-air-traffic-controllers-won-back-60-jobs-but.html |title=LAW: AT THE BAR; Lawyer for striking air traffic controllers won back 60 jobs but suffered personal loss |first=David |last=Margolick |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 20, 1989 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread use of the phrase with its current meaning may have begun in the late 1990s. In some cases it began to take on a neutral or even positive light, implying simply great enthusiasm. In 1998, the dictionary website logophilia.com defined the phrase thus: "To become a firm believer in something; to accept an argument or philosophy whole-heartedly."&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

The phrase has been used in the business and technology worlds to mean fervent devotion to a certain company or technology. A 2000 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article about the end of the [[dot-com bubble]] noted, "The saying around San Francisco Web shops these days, as companies run out of money, is 'Just keep drinking the Kool-Aid,' a tasteless reference to the Jonestown massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/29/opinion/the-shadow-in-silicon-valley.html |title=The Shadow in Silicon Valley |first=Rodes |last=Fishburne |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2000 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase or metaphor has also often been used in a political context, usually with a negative implication. In 2002, [[Arianna Huffington]] used the phrase "pass the Kool-Aid, pardner" in a column about an economic forum hosted by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/col/huff/2002/08/16/waco/index.html |title=Wacko in Waco |author=Arianna Huffington |publisher=Salon.com |date=August 16, 2002 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, commentators [[Michelangelo Signorile]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] have used the term to describe those whom they perceive as following certain ideologies blindly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/09/09/feeling-sorry-for-oreilly/ | work=Fox News | title=Feeling Sorry for O'Reilly | date=2005-09-09|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 speech, ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor [[Jon Meacham]] stressed his political independence by saying, "I did not drink the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Kool-Aid last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/apr/01/newsweek-editor-addresses-reagan-forum/ |title=Newsweek editor addresses Reagan Forum |first=Jake |last=Finch |newspaper=Ventura County Star |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, columnist [[Meghan Daum]] wrote that the phrase had become "one of the nation's most popular idiomatic trends," while bemoaning its rise in popularity, calling its usage "grotesque, even offensive." She cited, among others, usages by [[Starbucks]] CEO [[Howard Schultz]], who said that he "drank the Kool-Aid as much as anyone else about Obama," and ''[[Us Weekly]]'' magazine, which reported during the short marriage of [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[Kris Humphries]] that "Kris is not drinking the Kardashian Kool-Aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-daum-koolaid-20111117,0,347333.column |title=Don't 'drink the Kool-Aid' |first=Meghan |last=Daum |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, "Drinking the Kool-Aid" won first place in an online poll by ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' Magazine as "the single most annoying example of [[business jargon]]."&lt;ref&gt;

They are interdependent, in part determined by social institutions, marketed advertisement, and subject to learning (experience and observation) and habit formation (past-experience).

When trying to understand the self in terms of the brain, [[neuroscientist]]s have found contradictory results and [[paradox]]es. Nevertheless, Gonzalo Munevar has argued that neuroscience in an evolutionary context can give a proper explanation of the self. His Evolutionary Theory of the Self depends on, “the ability by the brain to coordinate new sensory information in light of the organism’s internal states and in the context of its personal history and genetic inheritance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gonzalo Munevar, Mathew L. Cole, Yongquan Ye, JieYang, Yi Zheng, Uday Krishnamurthy, and Mark Haacke, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” Neuroscience Discovery, 2014, http://www.hoajonline.com/journals/pdf/2052-6946-2-3.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is an alternative conception for the explanation of the self, which takes into account the [[evolutionary biology]] of the brain.

[[Organism]]s that are highly complex execute the function of telling self from other with the brain and the [[immune system]]. To fulfill the function of recognizing self from other, the brain uses past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] (e.g. survival, reproduction). The self is defined by these functions that distinguish an organisms from other organisms, which allow them to act as one whole entity in social and physical environments. Simply put, the theory revolves around the idea that the brain constitutes the self, which represents itself in a variety of internal states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;A. Damasio: The Feeling of What Happens, Harcourt Brace &amp; Co, New York 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“A Darwinian Account of Self and Free Will,” in Evolution 2.0: implications of Darwinism in Philosophy and the Social and Natural Sciences, ed. by Weinert, F. and Brinkworth, M.H. (Springer, 2011), pp. 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain/self evolves for action to be able to interact with social and physical environments. It is suggested that the brain performs a complex list of tasks to complete these interactions to distinguish self from other. This defines the brain to be characteristically distributive to complete complex tasks, and thus suggests that the self is also distributive. Therefore, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self detours from the traditional conceptions that include the self being a centralized, unitary mechanism that is both conscious (sense of self) and compiled of a collection of episodic memories. Alternatively, it suggests that the conception of self is mostly [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious]], and the brain evolves from past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] to create the evolutionary self.

In Munevar’s study, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” he aimed to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of this conception of the self as a distributive system, and discovered results complimenting the Evolutionary Theory of the Self while resolving the contradictions and paradoxes of traditional conceptions of self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==  Neuroscience problems and paradoxes of the self ==
One of the problems is that the results of brain-imaging studies of self-knowledge vary depending on the behavioral tasks chosen. Some studies use [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) to do self-attribution of personality traits, while others use [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). Other studies prefer to do tasks involving self-recognition (recognizing a photograph or yourself and others). Studies that use self-attribution studies, “find neural activation of the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC) as evidence for the self”, while studies consisting of self-recognition tasks find, “correlated activation of the right [[prefrontal lobe]] and regions of the [[Medial superior temporal area|medial]] and left hemisphere as evidence [[self-awareness]] and [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This variety of results of the studies have provided evidence for Gillihan and Farah to conclude that there is not a unitary and common [[neural system]] concerning the self, which leads into the next two problems of the traditional conception of self.&lt;ref name=gillihan&gt;Gillihan SJ and Farah MJ. ''Is self special? A critical review of evidence from experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience''. Psychol Bull. 2005; ''131'':76-97. | Article | PubMed&lt;/ref&gt; These problems are that the traditional conceptions of the self argue that the self is a unified mechanism that exists in a centralized area in the brain, and that the self is something we can consciously sense. The problems with these accounts are that there is scientific research contradicting the claims of traditional conceptions. Llinas suggests that the self is a form of perception and thus that the self is an invention of the brain just as secondary sensory qualities are.&lt;ref&gt;R. Llinas:  ''I of the Vortex'' (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is no one brain area that could account for the self, and he concludes that the self doesn’t exist. Although Llinas is confusing the conscious and unconscious self, because when he suggests the self as a form of perception he should be referring to the conscious self being a form of perception. Munevar suggests that Llinas is incorrect in assuming the self does not exist, because just as an elephant and the perception of an elephant are different things, so are the self and our perception of the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional conceptions also assume that the self is a collection of [[episodic memories]], since they are memories of the actions that sculpt our [[Personality psychology|personalities]], and therefore closely link personality and the self. According to Klein, in a study of patients who had lost their [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]] (the part of the brain responsible for memories), patients were able to recollect their knowledge of personality even in the absence of [[episodic memories]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Klein: The cognitive neuroscience of knowing one’s self. In ''The Cognitive Neurosciences''&lt;/ref&gt; This points to show that the trait summaries of their personality must have come around subconsciously, inferring that the self can exist even in the absence of [[episodic memories]]. Thus, the self cannot be a collection of [[episodic memories]].

== Solutions to the problems ==
The Evolutionary Theory points out that distributive systems are characteristic of the brain. Organisms need to identify itself from others in many complex ways, thus many areas of the brain are used when distinguishes self from other. We need to understand that the brain is full of distributed mechanisms, thus creating an expectation that the self will be too. With this understanding, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self avoids all the difficulties about the unified and central mechanisms that traditional conceptions hold. In addition, the brain-based model of the evolutionary theory recognizes that the majority of the mental tasks highly complex organisms do are unconscious. Simply put, we may be aware of a decision we have made, but not the calculations that went into the decision as they are not capable to be understood by the conscious self.&lt;ref&gt;F. Crick: The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul (Scribner’s Sons, New York 1994, 265-268).&lt;/ref&gt; By attempting to take an evolutionary approach to understanding the self, the confrontation of self with the sense of self is avoided, in addition to, “all the problems that arise from an undue emphasis on consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As suggested by Munevar, research on the evolutionary theory of self needs to firstly examine the existence of distributed activation in the brain when doing a self-attribution task. Secondly, they need to examine distinctions in brain activity when identifying self and close others in a manner of objective vs subjective to see if there are activation variances between the two. Thirdly, research needs to use non-personality traits as well as personality traits to take into account the importance of non-personality traits to the evolutionary needs of an organism. Fourthly, the research should aim to prove that humans, “should identify with those close to us, although not as strongly as with ourselves."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These four aims were the four that structured the hypotheses in his study, and provide blueprint for further research to test.

== Evidence to support the theory ==
In Munevar’s study, they compared self vs other conditions in which personality trait adjectives were rated in terms of Self vs Best Friend, Self vs Bill Gates, and Best Friend vs Bill Gates. He used a blocked-design [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] [[paradigm]], where non-personality and personality trait adjectives were rated as to whether they applied to themselves or other. The four hypotheses were as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Self conditions would show a different pattern of brain activation from those shown by Best Friend (i.e., close other) and Bill Gates (i.e., far other) conditions; (2) our data should exhibit a fair degree of distributive performance by the brain in responding to these attribution tasks; and (3) the resulting patterns of activation should show some overlap with structures normally involved in preparedness to action (motion). In addition, (4) the Best Friend condition would also differ from the Bill Gates condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The study found that several areas of the brain were active when doing the tasks related to ‘Self’ and Best Friend. In support of the first hypothesis (1), there was very significant differential activation in [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] (covering part of [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate gyrus]] and the medial parietal), and the [[substantia nigra]].&lt;ref name=gillihan/&gt; There was significant activity in the right and left portions of [[Brodmann area 23|BA 23]], and the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] tail. In a lesser degree, there was some activity in the [[Brodmann area 10|BA 10]] and the thalamus. There was also greater activation in [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]], particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, in Self-Bill Gates condition compared to the Best Friend-Bill Gates condition. With these results, there is different brain patterns shown by Best Friend and Bill Gate conditions. The contrasting results found also support the second hypothesis (2), and indicate that a large number of distributive structures throughout the brain are used when doing a self-attribution task.

In support of the third hypothesis (3), he found a large amount of activation of the [[substantia nigra]] (key stricture of [[basal ganglia]] for action), in addition to the activation of the [[caudate nucleus]] of the [[basal ganglia]]. These areas in the brain are known to be crucial to the process of movement, and thus an overlap with these structures supports their hypothesis.

In support of the fourth hypothesis (4), the greater activation of [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]] in comparison of Best Friend vs Bill Gates condition and the Self-Bill Gates condition points to show that humans strongly identify with those you are close to us, and less strongly with ourselves.

The results displayed that the brain areas that we use for thinking about ourselves may also be used for thinking about those who are important to us. The fact that there is this relationship with multiple parts of the brain being active during both goes to show that there is an association between the two, furthering to suggest that one area in the brain nor one unified mechanism is not responsible for the self. The results also support the evolutionary expectation of a connection between self and the preparedness for action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The activation of key areas in the [[basal ganglia]] and the differential activation of [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] by the self-conditions in contrast with the Best Friend conditions in this study, elude to further support the idea of personality being a product of the unconscious self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future work ==
From the results seen in Munevar’s study, there are several implications for the future progress of this theory. Since the study had a limitation of gender impacting the results of the conditions of Self vs Best Friend and Best Friend vs Bill Gates, further research should be done that classify results of fMRI by each gender. Another positive direction this study points to is by studying brains with deficits in activation of the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] that bring problems when identifying self from non-self. This problem is prevalent in mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and late-stage [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], where the ability to differentiate self vs other is compromised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research should use the results of Munevar's study and continue on to dissect the paradoxes and problems of traditional conceptions, while focusing on the evolutionary biology of the brain. Overall, the research done on the Evolutionary Theory of Self is promising and provides fruitful insight to the possibility of discovering new conclusions on what we know about the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To be in '''exile''' means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.

In [[Roman law]], ''exsilium'' denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a [[capital punishment]] alternative to death. [[Deportation]] was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. [[Relegation]] was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | entry=BANISHMENT (ROMAN) | title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]] | edition=3rd | year=1890 | pages=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[diaspora]] and [[refugee]] describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and "[[government in exile]]" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

==For individuals==
=== Exiled heads of state ===
{{main|List of heads of state or government who have been in exile}}
In some cases the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[head of state]] is allowed to go into exile following a [[coup]] or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13052996 |title=BBC News - What happens to deposed leaders? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoiding tax or legal matters ===
{{main|Tax exile|Fugitive}}
A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a ''tax exile''. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer [[Arthur Hailey]], who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels ''Hotel'' and ''Airport'',&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Cameron, ''Blue Trust: The Author, The Lawyer, His Wife, And Her Money,'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the English rock band the [[Rolling Stones]] who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called ''Exile on Main Street'', the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main Street: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones,'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Eduardo Saverin]], one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Facebook Co-Founder Saverin Gives Up U.S. Citizenship Before IPO|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s-citizenship-before-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the [[Ex-PATRIOT Act]], which would have forced such wealthy ''tax exiles'' to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|title=Facebook's Saverin fires back at tax-dodge critics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-facebook-taxes-idUSBRE84G11A20120517|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as [[litigation]] or [[criminal prosecution]]. An example of this is [[Asil Nadir]], who fled to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] for 17 years rather than face [[prosecution]] in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company [[Polly Peck]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war ===
Examples include:
:* [[Iraq]]i academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild Iraq in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Iraq-Appeals-Anew-to-Exiled/47791 |title=Iraq Appeals Anew to Exiled Academics to Return Home|first=Andrew |last=Mills |website=[[Reuters]] via chronicle.com |date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Jew]]s who fled persecution from [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/46415/libyan-exile-plan-uks-frozen-assets |title=Libyan exile plan for UK's frozen assets|first=Simon |last=Rocker |website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* People undertaking a religious or [[civil liberties]] role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example, [[nun]]s were exiled following the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|coup d'état of 1948]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-20/news/mn-233_1_bila-voda |title=For Exiled Nuns, It's Too Late : Banished by the Communist regime, Czechoslovakia's sisters of Bila Voda were symbols of persecution.

==For groups, nations and governments==
===Comfortable Exile===
{{main|Social alienation|Identity (social science)}}
It is an alternative theory recently developed by a young anthropologist, Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable exile is a “social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society.  Such people are considered “aliens” or internal “others” on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balan|first1=Binesh|title=Making of Comfortable Exile through Sanskritization: Reflections on Imagination of Identity Notions in India|journal=Contemporary Voice of Dalit, Sage Pub.|volume=10|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation in exile===
{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}
When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Babylon]]ian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.

After the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like [[Kościuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen&amp;nbsp;– or been forced&amp;nbsp;– to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.

Since the [[Cuban Revolution]] over one million [[Cubans]] have left [[Cuba]]. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Cuba]] only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be [[Cuban exile]]s. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.

===Government in exile===
{{main|Government in exile}}
During a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'état]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Polish government-in-exile]], a government in exile that commanded [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish armed forces]] operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the [[Free French Forces]] government of [[Charles De Gaulle]] of the same time, and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

== In popular culture ==
===Drama ===
[[File:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jason and Medea]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1907]]
[[File:Rama vanavas.jpg|thumb|Rama on the way]]

Exile is an early motif in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]]. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', written by [[Euripides]] in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of  Greek mythology. Euripides’ [[Medea]] has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Helene P. Foley: ''Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage''. University of California Press, 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
[[File:Klaus Mann.jpg|thumb|Exiled [[Klaus Mann]] as Staff Sergeant of the 5th US Army, Italy 1944]]
[[File:Anna Seghers Das siebte Kreuz 1942.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[Anna Seghers]]’ ''[[The Seventh Cross|Das siebte Kreuz]]'']]

After [[Medea]] was abandoned by [[Jason]] and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king [[Aigeus]] there, and became the stepmother of the hero [[Theseus]]. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the [[Polis]] and go away into exile. [[John William Waterhouse]] (1849–1917), the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter’s famous picture ''[[Jason and Medea]]'' shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elisabeth Prettejohn: ''Art of the Pre-Raphaelites''. Princeton University Press, London 2000, pp. 165-207. {{ISBN|0-691-07057-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet [[Ovid]], who lived during the reign of [[Augustus]]. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work ''Tristia'' (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tristia by Ovid – high drama and hoax|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/tristia-by-ovid-high-drama-and-hoax|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, at least in a temporary exile, was [[Dante]].

The German language writer of novels, Franz Kafka, called "the Dante of the twentieth century"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted after Harold Bloom: ''Genius. A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds''. Warner Books. New York 2002, p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-446-52717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the poet [[W. H. Auden]], describes the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel ''Amerika''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. an unabridged reading by [[Sven Regener]]: ''Amerika'', Roof Music, Bochum 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors [[Klaus Mann]]  and [[Anna Seghers]]. So Germany’s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit.&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Mauthner: ''German Writers in French Exile, 1933–1940'', Vallentine Mitchell, London 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85303-540-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Mann finished his novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Der Vulkan|de}}'' (''The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants'') in 1939&lt;ref&gt;which he started in September 1936, when he came to New York. Cf. Jan Patocka in: ''Escape to Life. German Intellectuals in New York. A Compendium on Exile after 1933'', ed. by Eckart Goebel/Sigrid Weigel. De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2012, p 354. {{ISBN|978-3-11-025867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Klaus Mann: Der Wendepunkt. Ein Lebensbericht''. (1949), Frankfurt am Main 2006, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; as he wrote in his literary balance sheet.  At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel ''Das siebte Kreuz'' (''[[The Seventh Cross]]'', published in the United States in 1942).

Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners [[V. S. Naipaul]] and [[Derek Walcott]] as well as the novelists [[Edwidge Danticat]] and [[Sam Selvon]].&lt;ref&gt; See Timo Müller, “[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14788810.2016.1220790?journalCode=rjas20 Forms of Exile: Experimental Self-Positioning in Postcolonial Caribbean Poetry],” ''Atlantic Studies'' 13.4 (2016): 457-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the notion of '''externology''' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' generalizes the basic properties of the family

: &lt;big&gt;''ε''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; = {E ⊆ X : X\E is a closed compact subset of X}&lt;/big&gt;

of [[Complement (set theory)|complements]] of the [[Closed set|closed]] [[Compact space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspaces]] of ''X'', which are used to construct its [[Alexandroff compactification]]. An externology permits to introduce a notion of end&lt;ref name=ncatlab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/proper+homotopy+theory|title=proper homotopy theory in nLab|website=ncatlab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; point, to study the divergence of [[Net (mathematics)|nets]] in terms of convergence to end points and it is a useful tool for the study and classification of some families of non compact topological spaces. It can also be used to approach a topological space as the [[Limit (category theory)|limit]] of other topological spaces: the externologies are very useful when a compact [[metric space]] embedded in a [[Hilbert cube|Hilbert space]] is approached by its [[open neighbourhood]]s.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; be a topological space. An '''externology''' on &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; is a non-empty collection &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; of [[open subsets]] satisfying:
* If &lt;big&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;, then &lt;big&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;;
* if &lt;big&gt;E ∈ ε, U ∈ τ&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;E ⊆ U&lt;/big&gt;, then &lt;big&gt;U ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;.

An '''''exterior space''''' &lt;big&gt;(X,τ,ε)&lt;/big&gt; consists of a topological space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; together with an externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt;. An open &lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt; which is in &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; is said to be an '''exterior-open subset'''. A map &lt;big&gt;f:(X,τ,ε) → (X',τ',ε')&lt;/big&gt; is said to be an '''exterior map''' if it is [[Continuous map|continuous]] and  &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(E) ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;, for all &lt;big&gt;E ∈ ε'&lt;/big&gt;.

The [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of exterior spaces and exterior maps will be denoted by '''E'''. It is remarkable that '''E''' is a [[Complete category|complete]] and [[Complete category|cocomplete]] category.

== Some examples of exterior spaces ==
* For a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; one can always consider the ''trivial externology'' &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt;={X}&lt;/big&gt;, and, on the other hand, the ''total externology'' &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;=τ&lt;/big&gt;. Note that an externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; is a [[topological space|topology]] if and only if the empty set is a member of &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; if and only if &lt;big&gt;ε=τ&lt;/big&gt;.
* Given a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt;, the externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; of the complements of closed compact subsets of &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt; permits a connection with the theory of [[proper map]]s.
* Given a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; and a subset &lt;big&gt;A⊆X&lt;/big&gt; the family &lt;big&gt;ε(X,A)={U⊆X:A⊆U,U∈τ}&lt;/big&gt; is an externology in &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt;. Two particular cases with important applications on [[Shape theory (mathematics)|shape theory]] and on [[dynamical systems]], respectively, are the following:
* If &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; is a closed subspace of the [[Hilbert cube]] &lt;big&gt;X=Q&lt;/big&gt; the externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;=ε(Q,A)&lt;/big&gt; is a resolution of &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; in the sense of the shape theory.
* Let &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt; be a [[continuous dynamical system]] and &lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt; the subset of [[periodic point]]s; we can consider the externology &lt;big&gt;ε(X,P)&lt;/big&gt;. More generally, if &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; is an invariant subset the externology &lt;big&gt;ε(X,A)&lt;/big&gt; is useful to study the dynamical properties of the [[Dynamical system|flow]].

== Applications of exterior spaces ==
* ''Proper homotopy theory'':&lt;ref name=ncatlab/&gt; A continuous map &lt;big&gt;f:X→Y&lt;/big&gt; between topological spaces is said to be ''[[Proper map|proper]]'' if for every closed compact subset &lt;big&gt;K&lt;/big&gt; of &lt;big&gt;Y&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(K)&lt;/big&gt; is a compact subset of &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt;. The category of spaces and proper maps will be denoted by '''P'''. This category and the corresponding proper [[homotopy category]] are very useful for the study of non compact spaces. Nevertheless, one has the problem that this category does not have enough limits and colimits and then we can not develop the usual homotopy constructions like [[loop space|loops]], homotopy limits and colimits, etc. An answer to this problem is the category of exterior spaces '''E''' which admits [[Model category|Quillen model structures]] and contains as a [[full subcategory]] the category of spaces and proper maps; that is, there is [[Full functor|full]] and [[Faithful functor|faithful]] [[functor]] &lt;big&gt;'''P'''→'''E'''&lt;/big&gt; which carries a topological space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; to the exterior space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ,ε&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;.
* ''Proper [[Lusternik–Schnirelmann category|LS category]]'': The problem of finding Ganea and Whitehead characterizations of this proper invariant can not be faced within the proper category because of the lack of (co)limits. Nevertheless, an extension of this invariant to the category of exterior spaces permits to find a solution to such a problem. This numerical proper invariant has been applied to the study of open 3-[[manifolds]].
* ''[[Shape theory (mathematics)|Shape theory]]'': Many [[Shape theory (mathematics)|shape]] invariants (Borsuk groups, Quigley inward and approaching groups) of a compact [[metric space]] can be obtained as exterior homotopy groups of the exterior space determined by the open neighborhoods of a compact metric space embedded in the Hilbert cube.
* ''Discrete and continuous dynamical systems (semi-flows and flows)'': There are many constructions that associate an exterior space to a dynamical system, for example: Given a continuous (discrete) flow one can consider the exterior spaces induced by the open neighborhoods of the subset of [[periodic point]]s, Poisson periodic points, [[omega limit]]s, etc. The constructions and properties of these associated exterior spaces are used to study the dynamical properties of the (semi-flow) flow.

[[Image:belkinFM.jpg|thumb|right|Belkin TuneCastII FM Transmitter with a modified antenna connected to an iPod music player.]]

A '''personal FM transmitter''' is a low-power [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[transmitter|radio transmitter]] that broadcasts a signal from a portable audio device (such as an MP3 player) to a standard FM radio. Most of these transmitters plug into the device's [[headphone jack]] and then broadcast the signal over an [[FM broadcast band]] frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio. This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home [[audio system]] or [[car stereo]] without requiring a wired connection. They are often used in cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips on Using FM Transmitters|url=http://www.overstock.com/guides/tips-on-using-fm-transmitters|website=Guides at Overstock.com|publisher=Overstock.com|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be in fixed locations such as broadcasting from a computer [[sound card]] throughout a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stream Music to Every Radio in the House—Cheap!|url=https://gizmodo.com/5905695/stream-music-to-every-radio-in-a-housecheap|website=Gizmodo.com|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100–300 feet (30–100 metres), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM [[frequency]] from 87.5 to 108.0 [[MHz]] in most of the world, 76.0 - 95.0 MHz for Japan, 65.0 - 74.2 MHz for Russia (or 88.1 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz in the US and Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/ftp/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/pn910724.pdf |format=PDF |title=FCC Public Notice Dated July 24, 1991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304112834/http://www.fcc.gov/ftp/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/pn910724.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Personal FM transmitters are commonly used as a workaround for playing portable audio devices on car radios that don't have an Auxiliary "AUX" input [[jack (connector)|jack]] or [[List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_.28A2DP.29|Bluetooth audio connectivity]]. They are also used to broadcast a stationary audio source, like a computer or a television, around a home. They can also be used for [[low-power broadcasting]] and [[pirate radio]] but only to a very limited audience in near proximity. They can also be used as a "talking sign" in [[real estate]] sales or similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeFelice|first1=Bill|title=Micro-Broadcasting: Getting The Most Out Of Part 15 Radio|url=https://www.hobbybroadcaster.net/resources/Micro-Broadcasting-02.php|website=hobbybroadcaster.net|accessdate=14 October 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
The legality and maximum permitted power levels or field strengths of these devices varies by country. In 2006 these devices became legal in most countries in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Standards, Regulations and Law|url=http://lpra.org/resources/european-standards-regulations-and-law/|website=Low Power Radio Association|publisher=Low Power Radio Association|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK Stautory Instrument IR2030/26/2 2011/0401/UK (from December 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ofcom document IR2030 |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/spectrum-management/research-guidelines-tech-info/interface-requirements/IR_2030-june2014.pdf|website=Ofcom|publisher=ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; permits unlicenced use of devices that can be shown to radiate less than 50 nanowatts (-43dBm), on a 0.2MHz raster in the range 87.5–108MHz.

[[Industry Canada]] permits transmitters that have an output lower than 100 µV/m at 30 meters (approximately 1 microwatt output).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Low-Power FM Broadcasting from Industry Canada|url=https://sites.google.com/site/lowpowerradio2/canadian-low-power-radio/ric40e.pdf|publisher=Industry Canada|accessdate=14 October 2014|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[United States]], Part 15 of the [[Federal Communications Commission|U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] rules specifies that no license is needed if FM transmitters have a Maximum Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of 0.01 microwatts or 250 µV/m measured at 3 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permitted Forms of Low Power Broadcast Operation|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297510A1.pdf|website=fcc.gov|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal Information ==

=== Life ===
Gardner LaClede Bishop was a barber and activist remembered for his contributions to the school integration movement in the [[District of Columbia]] in the 1940s and 1950s. He was born on January 20, 1909 in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;  He learned how to express his opinions early on, winning prizes as a high school debater in his home state.  Although he attended a year of college at [[Shaw University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], he did not graduate.  In 1930 he moved to Washington, D.C.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;  He lived east of the [[Anacostia River]] and, like his father, began working as a barber.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;  After challenging the comments of racist customers on multiple occasions, he was fired. Not cowed, he opened B&amp;D Barber Shop at 1515 U Street NW in 1940, which he owned and operated through his retirement in 1985.  His black clientele could get both “a haircut and an earful” from the “barber of U Street.”&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;  He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and was married for 58 years to Thelma Crutchfield Bishop, who died in 1989.  They had three children: Judine Bishop Johnson, Anita Harley, and Gardner L. Bishop Jr.  He died of kidney failure on November 25, 1992 at age 82.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== More Than Just Black and White ===
Bishop focused not only on the inequalities between black schools and white schools, but also on the differences between upper and lower class black schools and attitudes.  He was appalled by the snobbishness of the elite black Washingtonians.  Part of his motivation for organizing a strike at Browne Junior High School came from his rebuffed requests to transfer his daughter to [[Benjamin Banneker Academic High School|Banneker Junior High]].  Middle class black officials informed him that because he was only a barber, his daughter could not go to Banneker, a school meant for the middle class.  This rebuke infuriated Bishop, and fueled his mistrust of some of the activist organizations he saw as furthering the agendas of the upper classes of society, including the [[NAACP]].  Bishop verbalized his sense of frustration and oppression, saying, “We were on the bottom shelf.  I’m black and I’m poor, so I’m segregated twice.”&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

== The Fight Against Segregated Schools ==

=== Overcrowded Schools ===
When Bishop came to the nation’s capital, the public school system was segregated, and the facilities for black children and white children were far from equal.  As the population of the city expanded in the post World War II years, the schools, particularly the black schools, became overcrowded.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;  Between 1930 and 1950 the African American population alone doubled to 280,000 people, about 35% of D.C.’s total population.&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;  The shifting demographics of the city, with whites fleeing to the suburbs and the proportion of the black population steadily increasing, led to an unequal distribution of students amongst the available facilities.  Taxes were allocated to fund black schools and white schools based on population statistics collected in the decennial census, so by the end of the 1940s the black schools were receiving far less than their fair share of tax dollars based on the numbers of black children enrolled because of the outdated census data.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

	The situation at Browne Junior High School exemplified the failure of the school system to educate its constituents.  By the late 1940s, Browne was operating at double its intended capacity.  To accommodate the inflated student body, the school adopted a schedule of shifts that resulted in students receiving only 4 and a half hours of schooling per day.  Because the law required that students attend school for a minimum of six hours per day, this restriction was particularly galling to parents.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;   In an attempt to remedy the situation, which many people objected to, the school implemented the use of two abandoned white elementary schools, Blow and Webb. With this plan 1146 students would move between Browne, Blow and Webb to receive a full day of instruction, and the other 680 students would continue with the shortened school day.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;  To make matters worse, nearby white schools were operating under capacity and had plenty of room to accommodate more students.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Consolidated Parents Group ===

Gardner Bishop was unwilling to accept a substandard education for his children.  His oldest daughter, Judine, attended Browne in 1947.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;  He was outraged by the use of schools that whites had abandoned, not to mention the long walks that students had to take in the middle of their school day to move to a different building. Bishop did not see this shifting schedule as an acceptable solution to the overcrowding.  He and other disgruntled parents began holding meetings at Jones Memorial Church to discuss how to present their grievances to the school board.  They eventually became known as the Consolidated Parents Group.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Bishop took charge as the most visible and vocal member of the group, but came to rely on a set of leaders within the group that grew to have hundreds of members. With Bishop as president, there were two vice presidents, Marie W. Smith and Burma Whitted, a secretary, Unity T. Macklin, and a treasurer, James Haley Sr. At one of their first meetings they voted to stage a student “sit-out” to boycott the situation at Browne Junior High School.&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;

	The boycott started on December 3, 1947.  For two months, parents of Browne students refused to send their children to school.  They picketed outside the school and the Board of Education offices at the Franklin Administration Building, protesting the insufficient resources being provided for their students.  Eventually, due to pressure from the conservative black community and dwindling support, the boycott partially ended. The students returned to Browne but the boycott of Blow and Webb continued. When the boycott did come to an end on February 3, 1948 the Board of Education began using five school buildings so students would not have to switch buildings and could attend a full day of school.&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Bolling v. Sharpe ==
Bishop’s organizational efforts did not stop at Browne.  In 1949, he took a group of black students to the newly opened [[John Philip Sousa Junior High School|Sousa Junior High School]], a school for whites with many amenities.  The students were given a tour, but they were not allowed to enroll.  This incident resulted in a lawsuit, with Spotswood Bolling, one of the students on the tour, as a plaintiff.  The case was later argued in front of the Supreme Court with four other cases as part of the historic [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision.  [[Bolling v. Sharpe]] was unique because it introduced the argument that segregation itself was unconstitutional.  Additionally, the NAACP was not involved in the Bolling case because of Bishop’s continued suspicion of middle class black organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Legacy ==
Bishop’s activism made an impact because his efforts were broad yet focused.  He targeted specific injustices in the school system on a variety of fronts.  The strike made a social statement and allowed people to see the problem up close.  The court case attacked segregation from a legal standpoint, aimed at changing the laws themselves.  In addition, Bishop wrote Letters to the Editor of the Washington Post, on topics including school buildings and high school capacity, putting his arguments into print.&lt;sup&gt;[18]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; He was determined to ensure that whites did not become complacent because of the concessions allowed for middle class blacks in the school system.  He worked for the lowest members of society, those whose voices and rights were consistently ignored by the established powers. Although Gardner Bishop was not the most prominent civil rights activist of his time, he serves as a reminder that no matter what background people come from, if they speak their minds and fight for what they believe in they can leave a lasting impact.

{{Corporatism sidebar|expanded=Related}}
'''''Gemeinschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈmaɪnʃaft}}) and '''''Gesellschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|}}), generally translated as "[[community]] and [[society]]", are categories which were used by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in order to categorize social ties into two dichotomous sociological types which define each other. [[Max Weber]], who is generally recognized as being a founding figure in sociology, also wrote extensively about the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft''. Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy==
The ''Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft'' [[dichotomy]] was proposed by Tönnies as a purely conceptual tool rather than as an [[ideal type]] in the way it was used by [[Max Weber]] to accentuate the key elements of a historic/social change. According to the dichotomy, social ties can be categorized, on one hand, as belonging to personal [[social interaction]]s, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]"), or on the other hand as belonging to indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag.  An English translation of the 8th edition 1935 by Charles P. Loomis appeared in 1940 as ''Fundamental Concepts of Sociology (Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft)'', New York: American Book Co.;  in 1955 as ''Community and Association (Gemeinschaft und gesellschaft''[sic]'')'', London:  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul;  and in 1957 as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State U.P.  Loomis includes as an Introduction, representing Tönnies' "most recent thinking", his 1931 article "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft" in ''Handwörterbuch der Soziologie'' (Stuttgart, Enke V.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tönnies was a [[Thomas Hobbes]] scholar{{mdash}}he edited the standard modern editions of Hobbes's ''The Elements of Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=The Elements of Law Natural and Politic|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=Behemoth or the Long Parliament|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his study of Hobbes that encouraged Tönnies to devote himself wholly to the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. And it has been argued that he derived both categories from Hobbes's concepts of "concord" and "union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hont|first1=Istvan|editor1-last=Kapossy|editor1-first=Béla|editor2-last=Sonenscher|editor2-first=Michael|title=Politics in Commercial Society: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith|date=2015|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition, published in 1912, of the work in which Tönnies further promoted the concepts turned out to be an unexpected but lasting success&lt;ref&gt;Published with a more abstract subtitle ''Basic Terms of Pure Sociology'' (In German: "Grundbegriffe der reinen Soziologie").&lt;/ref&gt; after the first edition was published in 1887 with the subtitle "Treatise on Communism and Socialism as Empirical Patterns of Culture".&lt;ref&gt;In German: ''Abhandlung des Communismus und des Socialismus als empirischer Culturformen''&lt;/ref&gt; Seven more German editions followed, the last in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;  The 1935 edition was reprinted in 2005 by Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became part of the general stock of ideas with which pre-1933 German intellectuals were quite familiar. The book sparked a revival of [[Corporatism|corporatist]] thinking, including the rise of [[neo-medievalism]], the rise of support for [[guild socialism]], and caused major changes in the field of sociology.&lt;ref name="Peter F. Klarén 1986. Pp. 221"&gt;Peter F. Klarén, Thomas J. Bossert. ''Promise of development: theories of change in Latin America''. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 1986. P. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' were also used by Max Weber in ''Economy and Society'', which was first published in 1921.  Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weber 1968:4, and 40-43)&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is rooted in a "subjective feeling" that may be "affectual or traditional". ''Gesellschaft''-based relationships, according to Weber, are rooted in "rational agreement by mutual consent", the best example of which is a commercial contract.  To emphasize the fluidity and amorphousness of the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'', Weber modified the terms in German to ''Vergemeinschaftung'', and ''Vergesellschaftung'', which are the [[gerund]] forms of the German words.&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion see Waters and Waters 2015:3-6, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Weber's distinction between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' is highlighted in the essay "Classes, Stände, Parties",&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:37-58 in Weber's ''Rationalism and Modern Society'', Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters eds. New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basis for Weber's [[three-component theory of stratification]].

Having propounded his conception of the ''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy, Tönnies was drawn into a sharp polemic with [[Émile Durkheim]]. In a review of Tönnies' book in 1889, Durkheim interpreted ''Gemeinschaft'' as an organic community, and ''Gesellschaft'' as a mechanical one, reproaching Tönnies for considering the second type of social organisation artificial, and not seeing the transition from the one type to the other. Tönnies did not agree with such an interpretation of his views, and in turn, when reviewing Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1896), wrote that Durkheim's whole sociology was a modification and variant of Spencer's, which was also unjust.{{clarify |date=December 2017 |reason= How was Tönnies wrong? }}

==Globalization==

[[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that, as [[globalization]] turns the entire planet into an increasingly remote kind of ''Gesellschaft'', so too collective [[identity politics]] seeks for a fictitious remaking of the qualities of ''Gemeinschaft'' by artificially reforging group bonds and identities.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism'' (2007) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] highlights the ambivalent envy felt by those constructed by ''Gesellschaft'' for remaining enclaves of ''Gemeinschaft'', even as they inevitably corrode their existence.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside sociology ==
In [[business]] usage, ''Gesellschaft'' is the German term for "[[company]]", as in ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]'' or ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (''GmbH'').  "Gemeinschaft" is used to identify groups which have or are claimed to have an element of affective loyalty. One important usage is in the German name for the [[European Economic Community]], ''Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft''.

The German phrase for "mutual insurance company" includes both words, "mutual" and "company." In the 1980's, the Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company, headquartered in the German-American city of Frankenmuth, Michigan, released various promotional items such as matchbooks, featuring, in a traditional German Fraktur font, a translation of their company's name, "Frankenmuth Gemeinschafts Versicherinungs Gesellschaft."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5195">The '''generalized other''' is a concept introduced by [[George Herbert Mead]] into the [[social sciences]], and used especially in the field of [[symbolic interactionism]]. It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Any time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other.

==Precursors==

Mead's concept of the generalised other has been linked to [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the impartial spectator&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, ''Methodological Individualism'' (2001) p. 367n&lt;/ref&gt; – itself rooted in the earlier thinking of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]] and [[Epictectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Phillipson, ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' (2011) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote: "We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillipson, p. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role-play and games==

Mead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: "in the latter", he stated, "the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game".&lt;ref&gt;George H. Mead, ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (Chicago 1962) p. 159 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others' attitudes toward the (changing)  common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead argued that "in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself....in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters – as an organized process or social activity – into the experience of any one of the individual members of it".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 160 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others – the viewpoint of the generalized other.

The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society.

==Multiple generalized others==

Arguably,  a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings:&lt;ref&gt;F. C. da Silva, ''G. H. Mead'' (2007) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; as Mead put it, "every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt;

With rising levels of socialisation and [[individuation]], more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Voelz, ''Transcendental Resistance'' (2010) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic equivalents==

As a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian [[superego]]. It has also been compared to [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s use of the [[Name of the Father]], as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Crapanzano, ''Hermes' Dilemma and Hamlet's Desire'' (1992) p. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to Bakhtin's (Superaddressee) "superaddressee" presumed to receive and understand human communication.

'''Gift wrapping''' is the act of [[Packaging and labelling|enclosing]] a [[gift]] in some sort of material. '''Wrapping paper''' is a kind of [[paper]] designed for gift wrapping. An alternative to gift wrapping is using a gift [[box]] or bag. A wrapped or boxed gift may be held closed with [[ribbon]] and topped with a decorative bow (an ornamental [[knot]] made of ribbon).

==History==
[[File:Chinese hemp paper western han.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hemp]] [[wrapping paper]], China, circa 100 BC.]]
The use of wrapping paper is first documented in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], where paper was invented in 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name="Tsien"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |series=Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume= 5 part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Southern Song]] dynasty, monetary gifts were wrapped with paper, forming an [[envelope]] known as a ''chih pao''. The wrapped gifts were distributed by the Chinese court to government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Paper and Printing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx-9mS6Aa4wC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=16 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08690-5|page=122|quote=In the Southern Sung dynasty, gift money for bestowing upon officials by the imperial court was wrapped in paper envelopes (chih pao)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese text ''Thien Kung Khai Wu'', Sung Ying-Hsing states that the coarsest wrapping paper is manufactured with rice straws and [[bamboo]] fiber.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Hall brothers Rollie and Joyce Hall, founders of [[Hallmark Cards]], did not invent gift wrapping, their innovations led to the development of modern gift wrapping. They helped to popularize the idea of decorative gift wrapping in the 20th century, and according to [[Joyce Hall]], "the decorative gift-wrapping business was born the day Rollie placed those French envelope linings on top of that showcase."&lt;ref name="Regan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Regan|title=Hallmark: A Century of Giving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwczWM4D9o4C&amp;pg=PA45|date=15 December 2009|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-9240-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
Gift wrapping has been shown to positively influence the recipient who are more likely to rate their gifts positively if they had traditional gift wrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/129687-why-do-we-wrap-gifts-a-brief-history-of-wrapping-paper|title=Why Do We Wrap Gifts?

==By culture==
[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Gift wrapped presents beneath the Christmas tree]]
===Western cultures===
In Western culture, gifts are often wrapped in wrapping paper and accompanied by a gift note which may note the occasion, the receiver's name and the giver's name.

Modern patterned wrapping paper was introduced to the American market by the [[Hall Brothers]] in 1917.  The Kansas City stationery store had run out of traditional white, red, and green monocolor tissue papers, and started selling colorful envelope liners from France. Proving popular, the company promoted the new designs in the subsequent decades, adding ribbons in the 1930s, and Hallmark remains one of the largest American producers of gift wrap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/12/23/573217009/the-history-of-gift-wrap "The History Of Gift Wrap"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste====
In the United States, an additional five million tons of waste are generated over the [[Christmas]] gift-giving period; four million tons of this is wrapping paper and [[shopping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanair.org/Waste/wasteFacts.html |title=Waste Facts and Figures |website=cleanair.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people attempt to avoid this by unwrapping gifts with care to hopefully allow the paper to be reused, while others use decorated [[cloth]] gift sacks that can be easily reused many times; both of these concepts are part of the [[Green Gifting]] trend that encourages [[recycling]]. Additionally, some people use old newspapers instead of wrapping paper.

===Asian cultures===
In Chinese culture, [[Color in Chinese culture|red wrapping]] denotes luck.

In Japanese culture, wrapping paper and boxes are common. However, the traditional cloth wrapping called ''[[furoshiki]]'' is increasing in popularity, particularly as an [[Environmental movement|ecologically friendly]] alternative to wrapping paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/060403.html Minister Koike created the "Mottainai Furoshiki" as a symbol of Japanese culture to reduce wastes], [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korean culture, ''[[bojagi]]'' are sometimes used for gift wrapping. A ''yedanbo'' is a ceremonial gift bojagi used to wrap wedding gifts from the bride's family to the members of the groom's.&lt;ref name="koreanet"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527124028/http://www.korea.net/korea/kor_loca.asp?code=H080406 About Korea - Bojagi], korea.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good Deeds Day''' is an international day of [[volunteering]]. Beginning in 2007, its mission is to unite people from around the world in doing good deeds for others and the planet.

==Background==

This day of [[community service]] was launched in 2007 in [[Israel]] by businesswoman and [[philanthropist]], [[Shari Arison]], through [[Ruach Tova]], a [[Nonprofit organization]] that connects between people who want to volunteer and organizations in need of assistance.

Speaking about the day, initiator Shari Arison said: 
{{Quote|text= I believe that if people will think good, speak good and do good, the circles of goodness will grow in the world. Good Deeds Day has become the leading day of giving and this year individuals, school children, students, soldiers and employees from many businesses are joining in for the annual Good Deeds Day with the aim of doing a good deed for others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/900000-people-take-part-in-good-deeds-day/ 900,000 people take part in Good Deeds Day (Israel21c)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

Approximately 7,000 people participated in Israel in 2007. The day became global in 2011, with participants from around the world, including in the USA, [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. In 2012, project organizers teamed up with [[MTV]] Global for a six-week-campaign on its online and TV platforms, exposing the message to 24 million viewers around the world. In 2014, [[NASDAQ]] invited Shari Arison to kick off Good Deeds Day in the trading day closing bell ceremony. 2017 marked the fourth year in a row of the NASDAQ and Good Deeds Day collaboration.

Good Deeds Day 2018 will be on Sunday, April 15, 2018.

In 2017, the 11th annual Good Deeds Day, approximately 2,500,000 participants from 93 countries volunteered, marking it the largest and most global day yet. To celebrate, project organizers held mega events in Kenya, Portugal, Italy, Poland and more.

Good Deeds Day and Ruach Tova are part of The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927194639/http://www.arison.co.il/AFFHome.aspx?Lang=2 Ted Arison Family Foundation], the philanthropic arm of the Arison Group.

==Around the world==

In 2011, international companies [http://en.shikunbinui.co.il/ Shikun &amp; Binui] and [[Bank Hapoalim]] were among the first international participants in Good Deeds Day outside of Israel. As of 2016, Good Deeds Day is celebrated in 75 countries worldwide, and has collaborated with major cities such as Rome, São Paulo, Kaohsiung City, and New York City to create special events. In the Good Deeds Day event at Herald Square, New York City, actor and activist [[Adrian Grenier]] supported the day by speaking at the event:
{{Quote|It’s important to have a day in which we acknowledge wonderful people who are dedicated to doing good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtlwCohKXqY&amp;&amp;t=58s/ Adrian Grenier speaks in the 2016 Good Deeds Day Event at Herald Square, New York City (Youtube)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pope Francis]] endorsed the day in his Sunday sermon prior to Good Deeds Day 2015 in Rome and said:
{{Quote|I send my wishes to the numerous groups of volunteers that have united to show solidarity by doing good deeds that promote a better society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shariarison.com/en/content/pope-honors-good-deeds-day/ Pope honors Good Deeds Day (Shari Arison)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016 Good Deeds Day collaborated with [[Brazil]] based volunteering center Atados on a nationwide activation. Together they reached 10,000 volunteers around the country, and 40 cities across Brazil including major cities like [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasília]], and [[São Paulo]].

In [[Latin America]], major Good Deeds Day events took place in Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and 16 other countries in the region.

In [[Taiwan]], Good Deeds Day collaborated with TAVE (Taiwan Association for Volunteer Effort) to create major citywide activities in [[Kaohsiung City]], Taiwan in 2016. Taiwan’s Vice President, [[Chen Chien-jen]], and Kaohsiung’s Mayor, [[Chen Chu]], were among the government officials honoring the day in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwanhot.net/?p=81289 (TaiwanHot, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taoyuan City]] also hosted citywide activities, arranged by Taoyuan City Volunteer Service Association and other partnering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nownews.com/n/2016/05/05/2089169 (Now News, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest collaborations in [[Europe]] include SPES (Associazione Promozione e Solidarietà) in Italy, who organized a major Good Deeds Day event in Rome in 2016. Good Deeds Day invited runners in the [[Rome Marathon]] to join the “Roma Fun Run” and visit the Good Deeds Day fair of non-profits at the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insiemeperilbenecomune.org/ (Insieme per il bene comune, in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===

Good Deeds Day (Hebrew: יום מעשים טובים) first began in Israel in 2007 with 7,000 participants and grew to 1,500,000 in 2016. Local municipalities, companies, and nonprofit organizations all around the country participate by organizing special activities in their communities, renovating or painting buildings, building community gardens, and volunteering in many other ways for populations in need. Cities such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] also host special Good Deeds Day events that are open to the public, such as the 2016 “Counselor’s Boulevard” that took place on [[Rothschild Boulevard]], Tel Aviv. Professionals gave free counseling sessions to passersby. Other public events include the 2015 Good Deeds Day nonprofit Fair at [[Rabin Square]], Tel Aviv, and [[Ashkelon]], which included hair donation stands, dog adoption area, and a give-and-take market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5303">The '''government speech''' doctrine, in American [[constitutional law]], says that the government is not infringing the free speech rights of individual people when the government declines to use [[viewpoint neutrality]] in its own speech.&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;Hudson, David.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NBHgQfWaXhUC&amp;pg=PA91 The Rehnquist Court: Understanding Its Impact and Legacy]'', p. 91 (Greenwood Publishing 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;   More generally, the degree to which governments have free speech rights remains unsettled, including the degree of free speech rights that states may have under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] versus federal speech restrictions.&lt;ref name=Fagundes&gt;Fagundes, David.  "State Actors as First Amendment Speakers", ''Northwestern University Law Review'', Vol. 10, p. 1637 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volokh, Eugene.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/24/do-state-and-local-governments-have-free-speech-rights/ "Do state and local governments have free speech rights?"], [[Volokh Conspiracy]] (June 24, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual free speech rights versus government speech==
The government speech doctrine establishes that the government may advance its own speech without requiring viewpoint neutrality when the government itself is the speaker.  Thus, when the state is the speaker, it may make content based choices. The simple principle has broad implications, and has led to contentious disputes within the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt;

The doctrine was implied in ''[[Wooley v. Maynard]]'' in 1977, when the Supreme Court acknowledged a legitimate government interest in communicating an official, ideologically partial message to the public.  In the 1991 case of ''[[Rust v. Sullivan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rust v. Sullivan'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1391.ZO.html 500 U.S. 173] (1991).  See also ''Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia'', {{ussc|515|819|1995}}, as well as ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'', {{ussc|544|550|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; government-funded doctors in a government health program were not allowed to advise patients on obtaining abortions, and the doctors challenged this law on Free Speech grounds.&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt; However, the Court held that because the program was government-funded, the doctors were therefore speaking on behalf of the government.  Therefore, the government could say what it wishes, and “the Government has not discriminated based on viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Puiszis, Steven.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kOn2rCdcIGUC&amp;pg=PT837 Illinois Governmental Tort and Section 1983 Civil Rights Liability]'', p. 837 (Matthew Bender, Third Edition, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez]]'', the Supreme Court held that, although providing government-funded legal services appeared similar to government-funded doctors, the speech of the lawyers was private speech because lawyers spoke on behalf of their clients.  As a result, the government could not prevent these attorneys from filing constitutional suits against the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, John and Rotunda, Ronald.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DHaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT919 Nowak and Rotunda's Principles of Constitutional Law]'', p. 919 (West Academic, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free speech rights of states versus federal speech restrictions==
When one sovereign tries to limit the speech of another sovereign, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] may protect the latter from the former.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt;  David Fagundes has argued that government speech deserves constitutional protection only where the speech is intrinsic to a
public function and furthers democratic self-government.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt;

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]]. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on [[International Mother Earth Day]] on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hungry ghost''' is a concept in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Chinese traditional religion]] representing  beings who are driven by intense emotional needs in an [[Animals in Buddhism|animalistic]] way.
The term  {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:餓鬼|餓鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|èguǐ}}'', literally "'''hungry ghost'''", is the Chinese translation of the term ''[[preta]]'' in [[Buddhism]].
"Hungry ghosts" play a role in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] as well as in [[Chinese folk religion]].
The term is not to be confused with the generic term for "[[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]", {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:鬼|鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|guǐ}}'' (i.e. the spirit of a deceased ancestor). The understanding is that all people become such a regular ghost when they die,&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Venerable Yin-shun. ''The Way to Buddhahood''. Massachusetts: Wisdom Publications: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and would then slowly weaken and eventually die a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfnn.org/book/article2/1323.htm 目次：冥報記白話]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Eberhard, Stephen F. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. New Jersey: Princeton University Press: 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Hungry ghosts, by contrast, are a much more exceptional case, and would only occur in very unfortunate circumstances, such as if a whole family were killed or when a family no longer venerated their ancestors.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

With the rise in popularity of [[Buddhism]], the idea became popular that [[soul]]s would live in space until reincarnation.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; In the [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition it is believed that hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; and Taoism&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Oldstone-Moore, Jennifer. ''Taoism''. USA: Oxford University Press: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the [[Flower Garland Sutra|Hua-yen Sutra]] evil deeds will cause a soul to be reborn in one of six different realms.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Baroni, Helen J. Ph.D. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism''. New York: The Rosen Publishing Group, Incorporated: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be reborn as a denizen of [[Diyu|hell]], a lower degree of evil will cause a soul to be reborn as an animal, and the lowest degree will cause a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Gregory, Peter N., ed. ''Inquiry Into the Origin of Humanity''. Hawaii: University of Hawaii Press: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition, evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost are killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;

==Myths of origin ==
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 2.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Image from a Japanese scroll which describes the realm of the hungry ghosts and how to placate them. Currently housed at the [[Kyoto National Museum]], artist unknown.]]
There are many legends regarding the origin of hungry ghosts. In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition there are stories from ''Chuan-chi po-yuan ching'' ("Sutra of One Hundred Selected Legends") that is from the early third century.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Eberhardt, Wolfram. ''Chinese Festivals''. New York: Abelard-Schuman Ltd.: 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of these stories are as follows:

One story is of a rich man who traveled selling [[sugar-cane]] juice. One day a [[Buddhist monk|monk]] came to his house looking for some juice to cure an illness. The man had to leave, so he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence. Instead of doing this, she secretly urinated in the monk's bowl, added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived, he poured out the bowl and left. When the wife died she was reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Another such tale is of a man who was giving and kind. One day he was about to leave his house when a monk came by begging. The man instructed his wife to give the monk some food. After the man left his house his wife was overcome with greed. She took it upon herself to teach the monk a lesson, so she locked the monk in an empty room all day with no food. She was reborn as a hungry ghost for innumerable lifetimes.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Most times the legends speak of hungry ghosts who in a previous lifetime were greedy women who refused to give away food.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt; Other stories in the Buddhist tradition come from ''Kuei wen mu-lien ching'' ("The Sutra on the Ghosts Questioning Mu-lien"). One of the stories tells of a man who was a diviner who constantly misled people due to his own avarice and is now a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; There is another story in "The Legend of Mu-lien Entering the City and Seeing Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts". The story is about five hundred men that were sons of elders of the city they lived in. When monks came begging to the city for food, the sons denied them because they thought the monks would keep coming back and eventually take all their food. After the sons died they were reborn as hungry ghosts.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

==Celebrations and practices ==
[[File:Ghost Festival in Ping Chou.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Offerings are prepared for hungry ghosts during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{see also|Ghost Festival}}
In Chinese [[ancestor worship]]  鬼法界, 鬼界 is "the realm of hungry ghosts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/indexes/term-en.html Buddhism-dict.net] (accessed: October 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a belief of the [[oral tradition]] of Chinese villagers that the ghosts of the ancestors may be granted permission to return to the world of the living at a certain time of the year, hungry and ready to take what they can from there, if these spirits had not been given sufficient offerings by their living relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Martin | first = Emily | author2 = Emíly M. Ahern | title = The cult of the dead in a Chinese village| publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1973 | pages = | isbn =9780804708357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[festival]] called the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]] (TC: 盂蘭盆, SC: 盂兰盆 Yúlánpén) is held to honor the hungry ancestor ghosts and food and drink is put out to satisfy their needs.
The Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated during the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[[Stephen F. Teiser]]. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. Princeton University Press, 1996 .&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, during this month, the gates of [[Diyu|hell]] are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment.  These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who have forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their families. Tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn "[[hell money]]". It is believed that "hell money" is a valid currency in the underworld and helps ghosts to live comfortably in the afterlife. People also burn other forms of [[joss paper]] such as paper houses, cars and televisions to please the ghosts.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;"Hungry Ghost Festival". Essortment, 2002. Retrieved Oct 20, 2008. [http://www.essortment.com/all/hungryghostfes_opi.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune.  A big feast is held for the ghosts on the 15th day of the 7th month, where people bring samples of food and place them on the offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Live shows are also put on and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats is always empty as this is where the ghosts are supposed to sit to better enjoy the live entertainment. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes, so that the sound attracts and pleases the ghosts.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;[http://www.chinese-culture.net/html/hungry_ghost_festival.html "Chinese Culture: Hungry Ghost Festival"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These acts were better known as "Merry-making".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;"Ghost Festival" ChinaVoc 2001-2007 , {{cite web |url=http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608143719/http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest of the town wears an ornate crown of five gold and red panels, a practice borrowed from [[Buddhism]]. This represented the five most powerful deities (The [[Jade Emperor]], [[Guan Yu]], [[Tu Di Gong]], [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] and [[Xi Wangmu]]). He is believed to become their voice on earth.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

A sacrificial altar and a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or in front of the village. The [[Bodhisattva]] Ksitigarbha sits in front of the chair. Under the chair are plates of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

During the evening, [[incense]] is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity, the more incense burnt, the greater one's prosperity.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;  During the festival, shops are closed to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it. Behind the altar,  monks will sing songs that it is believed only the ghosts can understand. This rite is called ''shi ge'r'', meaning "singing ghost songs".&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Fifteen days after the feast, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to [[Diyu|hell]], people float lanterns on water and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a piece of board. Hungry ghosts are believed to have found their way back when the lanterns go out.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

It is believed that the [[soul]] contains elements of both [[yin and yang]]. The yin is the ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kui]]'', or demon part, and the yang is the ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', or spirit part. When death occurs, the ''kui'' should return to earth, and the ''shen'' to the grave or family shrine. If a ghost is neglected, it will become a ''kui''. The ''shen'', or ancestral spirit watches over its descendants, and can bring good fortune if properly worshipped.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;"Zhongyua Festival - Hungry Ghost Festival". China Daily. 2004 Aug 30. Retrieved 2008 Oct 20. [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/30/content_370126.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungry ghosts are different from the [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts of Chinese traditions]], which all people are believed to become after death. According to the [[Buddha Dharma]], there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;  Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The ghosts with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The ghosts with great wealth also have three subgroups: the ghosts of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the ghosts of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the ghosts of great powers, like ''[[yaksha]]s'' and ''[[rakshasa]]s'', who are the powerful rulers of ghosts. The ghosts of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the ghosts of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.

Sixteen hungry ghosts are said to live in [[Diyu|hell]] or in a region of hell. Unlike other hell dwellers, they can leave hell and wander. They look through garbage and human waste on the outskirts of human cities. They are said to be invisible during the daylight hours but visible at night. Some hungry ghosts can only eat corpses, or their food is burnt up in their mouths, sometimes they have a big belly and a neck as thin as a needle (this image is the basic one for hungry ghosts in [[Buddhism in Asia|Asian Buddhism]]).&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Folk beliefs and customs ==
[[File:GhostFestivalsMalaysia002.jpg|thumb|300px|A performance held during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. People are not supposed to sit in the red chairs at the front because they are reserved for the "hungry ghosts."]]
There are many folk beliefs and taboos surrounding the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]]. Spirits are thought to be dangerous, and can take many forms, including snakes, moths, birds, foxes, wolves, and tigers. Some can even use the guise of a beautiful man or woman to seduce and possess. One story refers to a ghost which takes the form of a pretty girl and seduces a young man until a priest intervenes and sends the spirit back to hell. It is believed that [[Demonic possession|possession]] can cause illness and/or mental disorders.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

During the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]] children are advised (usually by an elder in the family) to be home before dark, and not to wander the streets at night for fear a ghost might possess them. Swimming is thought to be dangerous as well, as spirits are believed to have drowned people. People will generally avoid driving at night, for fear of a "collision", or spiritual offence, which is any event leading to illness or misfortune.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;DeBernardi, Jean Elizabeth, and Jean DeBernardi. ''Rites of Belonging: Memory, Moderninity &amp; Identity in a Malaysian Chinese Community''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  While "ghost" is a commonly used term throughout the year, many people use the phrase "backdoor god" or "good brother" instead during the 7th month, so as not to anger the ghosts.  Another thing to avoid is sampling any of the food placed on the offering table, as doing this can result in "mysterious illness".  Any person attending a show at indoor entertainment venues (''[[getai]]s'') will notice the first row of chairs is left empty. These seats are reserved for the spirits, and it is considered bad form to sit in them. After an [[Joss paper|offering]] has been burnt for the spirits, stepping on or near the burnt area should be avoided, as it is considered an "opening" to the spirit world and touching it may cause the person to be possessed.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The English term has often been used metaphorically to describe the insatiable craving of an addict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Mark Epstein]] in '' Thoughts Without a Thinker'', pp. 29, 30, {{ISBN|0-465-08585-7}}, of the compulsive [[infidelity]] of a patient.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with Buddhism outside China==
The [[desire realm#Preta Realm|World of the Hungry Ghosts]] ''(preta)'' is one of the six domains of the [[desire realm]] of Buddhism.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Preta}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] Hungry Ghosts (Tib. ཡི་དྭགས་, Wyl. yi dwags, {{lang-sa|[[pretas]]}}) have their own realm depicted on the [[Bhavacakra]] and are represented as teardrop or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]]-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food such that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having "mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.

According to the [[History of Buddhism]], as elements of Chinese Buddhism entered a dialogue with Indian Buddhism in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], this synthesis is evident in the compassion rendered in the form of blessed remains of food, etc., offered to the ''pretas'' in rites such as [[Ganachakra]].  {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

===Japanese Buddhism===
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1.tif|thumb|475px|Section of the Hungry Ghosts Scroll depicting one of the thirty-six types of hungry ghosts who constantly seeks water to drink and explaining how those who have been born as such are saved by the offerings of the living. Kyoto Museum]]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], two such creatures{{Ambiguous|date=November 2016}} exist: the '''gaki''' and the '''[[jikininki]]'''.  Gaki (餓鬼) are the [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of [[jealousy|jealous]] or greedy people who, as punishment for their mortal vices, have been cursed with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as human [[corpse]]s or [[feces]], though in more recent legends, it may be virtually anything, no matter how bizarre. Jikininki (食人鬼 "people-eating ghosts") are the spirits of greedy, [[selfishness|selfish]] or [[impiety|impious]] individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. They do this at night, scavenging for newly dead bodies and food offerings left for the dead. They sometimes also loot the corpses they eat for valuables. Nevertheless, jikininki lament their condition and hate their repugnant cravings for dead human flesh. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

The Hungry Ghosts Scroll kept at the [[Kyoto National Museum]] depicts the world of the hungry ghosts, the suffering of these creatures and contains tales of salvation of these ghosts. The whole scroll has been designated as National Treasure of Japan and it was possibly part of a set of scrolls depicting the six realms which was kept at [[Sanjūsangen-dō]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hungry_Ghosts_Scroll_Kyoto_1.tif Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Is a Dream''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|La vida es sueño}} {{IPA-es|la ˈβiða es ˈsweɲo|}}) is a [[Spanish-language]] play by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]. First published in 1635 (or possibly in early 1636) during the Spanish Baroque period (NADV1),&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/  Introduction to Pedro Calderon De La Barca's, "The Wonder-Working Magician" on barca.classicauthors.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }} Retrieved 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it is a philosophical allegory regarding the human situation and the mystery of life.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The play has been described as "the supreme example of [[Spanish Golden Age theatre|Spanish Golden Age drama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Racz | first=Gregary | year=2006 | title=Pedro Calderón de la Barca: Life Is a Dream | publisher=Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-310482-7|page= viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the fictional Segismundo, Prince of Poland, who has been imprisoned in a tower by his father, King Basilio, following a dire prophecy that the prince would bring disaster to the country and death to the King.  Basilio briefly frees Segismundo, but when the prince goes on a rampage, the king imprisons him again, persuading him that it was all a dream.

The play's central themes are the conflict between [[free will]] and [[Destiny|fate]], as well as restoring one's honor (NADV1). It remains one of Calderón's best-known and most studied works.  Other themes include dreams vs. reality and the conflict between father and son.  The play has been adapted for other stage works, in film and as a novel.

==Historical context==
[[File:Lope de vega 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title page of a comedy by Spanish playwright [[Lope de Vega]]]]
[[Spanish Empire|Catholic Spain]] was the most powerful European nation by the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cowans, Jon (ed). ''Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History'', University of Pennsylvania Press (2003), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by England in 1588, however, while Spain was trying to defend the northern coast of Africa from the expansion of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drama for students [Volume 23]: presenting analysis, context and criticism on commonly studied dramas|year=2006| location=Detroit| isbn=978-0-7876-8119-7| url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE%7C5FCO&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_main&amp;it=aboutBook&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1| editor=Sara Constantakis|format=Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gold and silver that Spain took from its possessions in the [[New World]] were not adequate to sustain its subsequent decades of heavy military expenses. Spain's power was rapidly waning by the time Calderón wrote ''Life Is a Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream| year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado| pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, "Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age" (Ch. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of Calderón was also marked by deep religious conviction in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd| first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic church had fostered Spanish pride and identity, to the extent that "speaking Christian" became, and remains, synonymous with speaking Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado| location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}} This religious fervor permeated the theatre of the time in that a prevalent theme was free will versus predestination.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another current that permeated Spanish thinking was the radical departure from the medieval ideal that royal power resided in God's will, as noted in [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Prince]]'' (1532). [[Francisco Suárez|Francisco Suarez’s]] treatise ''On the Defense of Faith'' (''De defensio fidei'', 1613) stated that political power resided in the people and rejected the divine rights of kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suarez| first=Francisco| title=DEFENSA DE LA FE (DEFENSIO FIDEI)|year=1971|publisher=Instituto de Estudios Politicos de Madrid| location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juan Mariana]]'s ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599) went even further by stating that the people had the right to murder despotic kings.&lt;ref&gt;Mariana, Jaun. ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}}

Amidst these developments during the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain experienced a cultural blossoming referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. [http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm "The Spanish Empire" (Ch. 13)] in ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', vol. 1, The Library of Iberian Resources Online (1973), accessed December 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Golden Age was brought about by the colonization of Americas, as they took advantage of the newfound resources. It saw the birth of notable works of art: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] (1605), played with the vague line between reality and perception.&lt;ref&gt;Constantakis, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lope de Vega]], in his play ''[[Fuente Ovejuna]]'' (1619), talks about a village that rebels against authority. 
==Synopsis==

===Act I===
[[File:La vida es sueño, en el 35 Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico (16).jpg|thumb|''La vida es sueño'', 35th Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico, [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]] (2012)]]
Rosaura walks through the mountains of Poland, dressed as a man. She finds Clarín, a jester, who tries to make her forget how miserably Poland receives visitors. They arrive at a tower, where they find Segismundo imprisoned, bound in chains. He tells them that his only crime was being born. Clotaldo, Segismundo's old warden and tutor, arrives and orders his guards to disarm and kill the intruders, but he recognizes Rosaura's sword as his own that he had left behind in [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muskovy]] (for a favor that he owed) years ago for his child to bear. Suspecting that Rosaura is his child (he thinks she is male), he takes Rosaura and Clarín with him to court. Fife also appears in this play, who is Rosaura's friend.

[[File:Royal Castle in Warsaw during the reign of John Sobieski.jpg|left|thumb|The royal palace in medieval Poland]]
At the palace, Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, discusses with his cousin, Princess Estrella (Segismundo's cousin), that as they are the nephew and niece of King Basilio of Poland, they would be his successors if they married each other. Estrella is troubled by the locket that Astolfo wears, with another woman's portrait. Basilio reveals to them that he imprisoned his infant son, Segismundo, due to a prophecy by an oracle that the prince would bring disgrace to Poland and would kill his father, but he wants to grant his son a chance to prove the oracle wrong. If he finds him evil and unworthy, he will send him back to his cell, making way for Astolfo and Estrella to become the new king and queen. Clotaldo enters with Rosaura, telling Basilio that the intruders know about Segismundo. He begs for the king's pardon, as he knows he should have killed them. The king says he should not worry, for his secret has already been revealed. Rosaura tells Clotaldo that she wants revenge against Astolfo, but she won't say why. Clotaldo is reluctant to reveal that he thinks he is Rosaura's father.

===Act II===
Clotaldo gives Segismundo a sedative that "robs one in his sleep of his sense and faculties" (109), which puts him in a sleep similar to death. In the Royal Palace of the capital city of Warsaw, Clotaldo has learned that Rosaura is a woman; Clarín explains that Rosaura is Princess Estrella's maid but has been going by the name of Astrea. When Segismundo is awakened and arrives at court, Clotaldo tells him that he is the prince of Poland and heir to the throne. He resents Clotaldo for keeping this secret from him for all those years. He finds Duke Astolfo irritating and is dazzled by Estrella's beauty.  When a servant warns him about the princess's betrothal to Astolfo, Segismundo is enraged by the news and throws the servant from the balcony.

The king demands an explanation from his son. He tries to reason with him, but Segismundo announces he will fight everyone, for his rights were denied him for a long time. Basilio warns him that he must behave, or he might find out he's dreaming. Segismundo interrupts a conversation between Rosaura and Clarín. Rosaura wants to leave, but Segismundo tries to seduce her. Clotaldo steps up to defend his child, but Segismundo pulls out a dagger threatening to kill him. As Clotaldo begs for his life, Astolfo challenges Segismundo to a duel. Before they proceed, the king sedates the prince again and sends him back to his cell.

The king dreams he is a king,
And in this delusive way
Lives and rules with sovereign sway;
All the cheers that round him ring,
Born of air, on air take wing.
And in ashes (mournful fate!)
Death dissolves his pride and state:
Who would wish a crown to take,
Seeing that he must awake
In the dream beyond death's gate?

....

'Tis a dream that I in sadness
Here am bound, the scorn of fate;
'Twas a dream that once a state
I enjoyed of light and gladness.
What is life? 'Tis but a madness.
What is life? A thing that seems,
A mirage that falsely gleams,
Phantom joy, delusive rest,
Since is life a dream at best,
And even dreams themselves are dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Denis Florence Mac-Carthy in ''Calderon's Dramas'', pp. 78-79. London: Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Segismundo.ogg|title=Segismundo's soliloquy (in Spanish)|format=[[Ogg]]}}
After recriminating Astolfo for wearing another woman's portrait around his neck, Estrella commands Rosaura (still going by Astrea) to fetch this locket for her. When she approaches Astolfo for the locket, he says he recognized her as Rosaura and refuses to give her the locket, because the portrait inside is hers. Estrella walks in and demands to see it immediately, but, afraid of being discovered, Rosaura says the locket in Astolfo's hand is actually her own, and that he has hidden the one she was sent to fetch. Estrella leaves furious. Meanwhile, Clotaldo sends Clarín to prison, believing that Clarín knows his secret.

Segismundo mutters in his sleep about murder and revenge. When the prince wakes up, he tells Clotaldo about his "dream". Clotaldo tells him that even in dreams, people must act with kindness and justice. When he leaves, Segismundo is left reflecting on dreams and life.

===Act III===
The people find out that they have a prince and many rebel, breaking him out of his prison tower, although at first they comically mistake Clarin for the prince. Segismundo finds Clotaldo, who is afraid of his reaction. Segismundo forgives him, asking to join his cause, but Clotaldo refuses, swearing allegiance to the king. Back in the palace, everyone prepares for battle, and Clotaldo speaks with Rosaura. She asks him to take Astolfo's life, as he had taken her honor before leaving her. Clotaldo refuses, reminding her that Duke Astolfo is now the heir to the throne. When Rosaura asks what will be of her honor, Clotaldo suggests that she spend her days in a nunnery. Disheartened, Rosaura runs away.

As war nears, Segismundo sees Rosaura, who tells him that she was the youth who found him in his prison and also the woman who he tried to seduce in court. She tells him that she was born in Muscovy of a noble woman who was disgraced and abandoned. She had the same fate, falling in love with Astolfo and giving him her honor before he abandoned her to marry Estrella. She followed him to Poland for revenge, finding that Clotaldo is her father, but he is unwilling to fight for her honor. Rosaura compares herself to female warriors Athena and Diana. She wants to join Segismundo's battle and to kill Astolfo or to die fighting. Segismundo agrees. While soldiers cheer for Segismundo, Rosaura and Clarín are reunited, and the king's soldiers approach.

Segismundo's army is winning the battle. Basilio, Clotaldo and Astolfo are preparing to escape when Clarín is killed in front of them. Segismundo arrives and Basilio faces his son, waiting for his death, but Segismundo spares his life. In light of the Prince's generous attitude, the King proclaims Segismundo heir to his throne. As King, Segismundo decides that Astolfo must keep his promise to marry Rosaura to preserve her honor. At first Astolfo is hesitant because she is not of noble birth, but when Clotaldo reveals that she is his daughter, Astolfo consents. Segismundo then claims Estrella in marriage himself. Segismundo resolves to live by the motto that "God is God", acknowledging that, whether asleep or awake, one must strive for goodness.

==Themes and motifs==
[[File:Pedro Calderón de la Barca 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Calderón]]
;Dreams vs. reality
The concept of life as a dream is an ancient one found in Hinduism and Greek philosophy (notably Heraclitus and the famous Platonic [[Allegory of the Cave]]), and is directly related to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' [[dream argument]]. It has been explored by writers from [[Lope de Vega]] to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ De La Barca, Pedro Calderón. Introduction to "The Wonder-Working Magician"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }}, barca.classicauthors.net. Retrieved 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Key elements from the play may be derived from the Christian legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]], which Lope de Vega had brought to the stage.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia Reidy|first=Alejandro|title=Las posibilidades dramaticas de Barlaam y Josafat: De Lope de Vega a sus epigonos |url=https://www.academia.edu/825478/Las_posibilidades_dramaticas_de_la_historia_de_Barlaam_y_Josafat_de_Lope_de_Vega_a_sus_epigonos|publisher=Universidad de Santiago de Compostela|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This legend is, itself, a derivation of the story of the early years of [[Siddharta Gautama]], which serves as the basis for the film ''[[Little Buddha]]'' that illustrates the [[maya (Hinduism)|Hindu-Buddhist concept of reality as illusion]].&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; 

;Father vs. son conflict
One of the major conflicts of the play is the opposition between king and prince, which parallels with the struggle of Uranus vs. Saturn or Saturn vs. Jupiter in classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;De Armas, Frederick A. "The Critical Tower", ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of La vida es sueño'', pp. 3–14, Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle is a typical representation of the opposition in baroque comedy between the values represented by a fatherly figure and those embodied by the son.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; An opposition which, in this case, may have biographical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Alexander A. "The Father-Son Conflict in the Drama of Calderón", ''Forum for Modern language Studies'', 2 (1966), pp. 99–113&lt;/ref&gt;

;Honor
The theme of honor is major to the character Rosaura. She feels she has been stripped of her honor, and her aim is to reclaim it. She feels that both her and her mother were subjected to the same fate. She pleads to Clotaldo about earning her honor back, which he denies and sends her to a nunnery.

;Other motifs and themes
Motifs and themes derived from a number of traditions found in this drama include the [[labyrinth]], the monster, free will vs. predestination, the four elements, original sin, pride and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Timothy. "Calderón and Borges: Discovering Infinity in the Labyrinth of Reason", ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'', (ed.) Frederick A. de Armas, pp. 197–218.

==Analysis and interpretations==

===Rosaura subplot===
[[File:Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca.jpg|thumb|upright|Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca]]
The Rosaura subplot has been subjected to much criticism in the past as not belonging to the work. Menéndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, ''Calderón y su teatro''. Madrid: A. Perez Dubrull, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Sloman, "The Structure of Calderón's ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón''," ed. Bruce W. Wardropper, 90–100. New York: New York University Press, 1965"&lt;/ref&gt; Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Wilson, "On ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Whitby "Rosarura's Role in the Structure of ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 101–13&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse/hippogriff to the plot of [[Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For [[Frederick de Armas]], Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of ''auroras'', "dawns") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. de Armas, ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderón''. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Segismundo's conclusions===
There have been many different interpretations of the play’s ending, where Segismundo condemns the rebel soldier who freed him to life imprisonment in the tower. Some have suggested that this scene is ironic – that it raises questions about whether Segismundo will in fact be a just king. Others have pointed out that Calderón, who lived under the Spanish monarchy, could not have left the rebel soldier unpunished, because this would be an affront to royal authority.

It is worth considering that Segismundo’s transformation in the course of the play is not simply a moral awakening, but a realization of his social role as the heir to the throne, and this role requires him to act as kings act. For some, the act of punishing the rebel soldier makes him a Machiavellian prince.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Hall, "Segismundo and the Rebel Soldier," Bulletin of Hispanic Studies 45 (1968): 189–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, while this action may seem unjust, it is in keeping with his new social status as the king. Daniel L. Heiple traces a long tradition of works where treason seems to be rewarded, but the traitor or rebel is subsequently punished.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Heiple, "The Tradition Behind the Punishment of the Rebel Soldier in ''La vida es sueño''," ''Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'' 50 (1973): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may well be that, rather than intending his audience to see this action as purely right or wrong, Calderón purposefully made it ambiguous, creating an interesting tension in the play that adds to its depth.

Her researches and works are all based around the survivors (and current patients) suffering from cancer, with issues varying from computerized online screening for distress to survivorship issues. Much of her attention is also towards the implementation and evaluation of Integrative Oncology interventions, including [[mindfulness]]-based programs ''viz.'' [[yoga]], [[meditation]], [[reiki]], [[acupuncture]], [[smoking cessation]] and other natural health products.

She also studies the effects of [[psychosocial]] interventions on [[Psychoneuroimmunology|psychoneuroimmunological]] [[biomarker]]s in cancer patients and has published over 240 research papers and books.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ErMV4UkAAAAJ|title=Linda E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21286">'''Medicalization''' or '''medicalisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|see spelling differences]]) is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as [[medical conditions]], and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], or treatment. Medicalization can be driven by new evidence or hypotheses about conditions; by changing social attitudes or economic considerations; or by the development of new medications or treatments.

Medicalization is studied from a [[sociology|sociologic perspective]] in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a [[medical model of disability]] tends to be used in place of a [[social model of disability|social model]]. Medicalization may also be termed "'''pathologization'''" or (pejoratively) "[[disease mongering]]". Since medicalization is the social process through which a condition becomes a medical disease in need of treatment, medicalization may be viewed as a benefit to human society. Upon identification of a condition as a disease, certain symptoms and conditions can be treated, and this will improve the overall quality of life.

==Development of the concept==
The concept of medicalization was devised by sociologists to explain how medical knowledge is applied to behaviors which are not self-evidently medical or biological.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''medicalization'' entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of [[Irving Zola]], [[Peter Conrad (sociologist)|Peter Conrad]] and [[Thomas Szasz]], among others. According to Dr. Cassell's book, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine (2004),'' the expansion of medical social control is being justified as a means of explaining deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173843216|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine|last=1928-|first=Cassell, Eric J.,|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156164|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's "The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance", published in 1973 ([[Hyperkinetic disorder|hyperkinesis]] was the term then used to describe what we might now call [[ADHD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad P |title=The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on the medicalization of deviant behavior |journal=Soc Probl |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=12&amp;ndash;21 |date=October 1975 |pmid=11662312 |doi= 10.1525/sp.1975.23.1.03a00020|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[opium]] was used to pacify children in ancient Egypt before 2000 BC.

These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz,1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of "psychotechnology" (Chorover,1973).

In the 1975 book ''Limits to medicine: Medical nemesis'' (1975), [[Ivan Illich]] put forth one of the earliest uses of the term "medicalization". Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through [[iatrogenesis]], a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the ''clinical'', involving serious [[side effects]] worse than the original condition; the ''social'', whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the ''structural'', whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively "medicalized" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these "natural" processes.

The concept of medicalization dovetailed with some aspects of the 1970s [[feminist]] movement. Critics such as [[Barbara Ehrenreich|Ehrenreich]] and English (1978) argued that women's bodies were being medicalized by the predominantly male medical profession. Menstruation and pregnancy had come to be seen as medical problems requiring interventions such as [[hysterectomies]].

[[Marxist]]s such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive [[capitalist]] society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as [[social inequality]] and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Culture, Health and Illness|last = Helman|first = Cecil|publisher = Arnold|year = 2007|isbn = 9780340914502|location = London|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/?id=C3BoQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including the use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others.

Tiago Correia (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Correia |first=Tiago |year=2017 |title=Revisiting Medicalization: A Critique of the Assumptions of What Counts As Medical Knowledge |journal=Front. Sociol. |volume=2 |issue=14 |doi=10.3389/fsoc.2017.00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers an alternative perspective on medicalization. He argues that medicalization needs to be detached from biomedicine to overcome much of the criticism it has faced, and to protect its value in contemporary sociological debates. Building on [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]'s hermeneutical view of medicine, he focuses on medicine's common traits, regardless of empirical differences in both time and space. Medicalization and social control are viewed as distinct analytical dimensions that in practice may or may not overlap. Correia contends that the idea of "making things medical" needs to include all forms of medical knowledge in a global society, not simply those forms linked to the established (bio)medical professions. Looking at "knowledge", beyond the confines of professional boundaries, may help us understand the multiplicity of ways in which medicalization can exist in different times and societies, and allow contemporary societies to avoid such pitfalls as "demedicalization" (through a turn towards [[complementary and alternative medicine]]) on the one hand, or the over-rapid and unregulated adoption of biomedical medicine in non-western societies on the other. The challenge is to determine what medical knowledge is present, and how it is being used to medicalize behaviors and symptoms.

== Professionals, patients, corporations and society ==
Several decades on the definition of medicalization is complicated, if for no other reason than because the term is so widely used. Many contemporary critics position [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the space once held by doctors as the supposed [[catalysts]] of medicalization. Titles such as ''"The making of a disease"'' or ''"Sex, drugs, and marketing"'' critique the [[pharmaceutical industry]] for shunting everyday problems into the domain of professional [[biomedicine]]. At the same time, others reject as implausible any suggestion that society rejects [[drugs]] or [[drug companies]] and highlight that the same drugs that are allegedly used to treat [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]s from [[societal norms]] also help many people live their lives. Even scholars who critique the societal implications of brand-name drugs generally remain open to these drugs' curative effects — a far cry from earlier calls for a revolution against the biomedical establishment.  The emphasis in many quarters has come to be on "overmedicalization" rather than "medicalization" in itself.

Others, however, argue that in practice the process of medicalization tends to strip subjects of their social context, so they come to be understood in terms of the prevailing biomedical [[ideology]], resulting in a disregard for overarching social causes such as unequal distribution of power and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15210098 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.003 | volume=59 | issue=6 | title=The medical text: between biomedicine and hegemony |date=September 2004 | author=Filc D | journal=Soc Sci Med | pages=1275–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of publications by [[Mens Sana Monographs]] have focused on medicine as a [[corporate]] capitalist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=2;spage=19;epage=51;aulast=Singh "Medicine as a corporate enterprise, patient welfare centered profession, or patient welfare centered professional enterprise?"] Mens Sana Monographs, 3(2), p19-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=5;epage=35;aulast=Singh "The connection between academia and industry"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p5-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=41;epage=80;aulast=Singh "Public welfare agenda or corporate research agenda?"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p41-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Relación Médico Paciente.png|thumb|right|Conversation between doctor and patient]]

The physician's role in this present-day notion of medicalization is similarly complex. On the one hand, the doctor remains an authority figure who [[prescribes]] [[pharmaceuticals]] to [[patient]]s. However, in some countries, such as the USA, ubiquitous [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] encourages patients to ask for particular drugs by name, thereby creating a conversation between consumer and drug company that threatens to cut the doctor out of the loop. Additionally, there is a widespread concern regarding the extent of the [[pharmaceutical marketing]] direct to doctors and other healthcare professionals. Examples of this direct marketing are visits by salespeople, funding of journals, training courses or conferences, incentives for prescribing, and the routine provision of "information" written by the pharmaceutical company.

The role of patients in this economy has also changed. Once regarded as passive victims of medicalization, patients can now occupy active positions as [[advocates]], [[consumer]]s, or even agents of change.

The antithesis of medicalization is the process of [[paramedicalization]], where human conditions come under the attention of [[alternative medicine]], [[traditional medicine]] or any of numerous non-medical health approaches. Medicalization and paramedicalization can sometimes be contradictory and conflicting, but they also support and strengthen each other since they both ensure that questions of health and illness stay in sharp focus in defining human conditions and problems.

== Areas ==
A 2002 editorial in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. The authors noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inappropriate medicalisation carries the dangers of unnecessary labelling, poor treatment decisions, iatrogenic illness, and economic waste, as well as the opportunity costs that result when resources are diverted away from treating or preventing more serious disease. At a deeper level it may help to feed unhealthy obsessions with health, obscure or mystify sociological or political explanations for health problems, and focus undue attention on pharmacological, individualised, or privatised solutions.&lt;ref name=Moynihan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Ray|last2=Heath|first2=Iona|last3=Henry|first3=David|title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering|journal=[[BMJ]]|date=13 April 2002|volume=324 | issue = 7342 |pages=886–891|pmid=11950740|pmc=1122833|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For many years, marginalized psychiatrists (such as [[Peter Breggin]], [[Paula Caplan]], [[Thomas Szasz]]) and outside critics (such as [[Stuart A. Kirk]]) have "been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality". More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (e.g., [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], [[Allen Frances]]).&lt;ref name=stuarta&gt;{{cite book |author= Kirk, S. A., Gomory, T., &amp; Cohen, D. |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page= 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Rush]], the father of American psychiatry, claimed that Black people had black skin because they were ill with hereditary leprosy. Consequently, he considered [[vitiligo]] as a "spontaneous cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Manufacture of Madness | publisher=Syracuse University Press | year=1970 | pages=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Franco Basaglia]] and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.&lt;ref name="Sapouna"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sapouna|first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann|first2=Peter|title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&amp;pg=PA70|publisher=Nova Publishers |location=Hauppauge|year=2006|page=70|isbn=1-59454-812-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances.&lt;ref name="Metzl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Metzl|first=Jonathan|title=The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease|year=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-8592-8|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1Bg9QEiCAMC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

The [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] allegedly caused from the 1980s a "profound re-medicalization of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Aggleton, Peter |author2=Parker, Richard Bordeaux |author3=Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-520-21838-8 |oclc= |doi=}} p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carole S.

According to Kittrie, a number of phenomena considered "deviant", such as [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]], [[prostitution]], [[pedophilia]], and [[masturbation]] ("self-abuse"), were originally considered as moral, then legal, and now medical problems.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Nick |title=The therapeutic community movement: charisma and routinization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lc4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1989 |page=1 |isbn=0-415-02913-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Kittrie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittrie |first=Nicholas |title=The right to be different: deviance and enforced therapy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIVqAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |location= |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-1319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable other conditions such as obesity, smoking cigarettes, draft malingering, bachelorhood, divorce, unwanted pregnancy, kleptomania, and grief, have been declared a disease by medical and psychiatric authorities who hold impeccable institutional credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Theology of Medicine | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1977 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these perceptions, peculiar deviants were subjected to moral, then legal, and now medical modes of social control.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Similarly, Conrad and Schneider concluded their review of the medicalization of deviance by identifying three major paradigms that have reigned over deviance designations in different historical periods: deviance as sin; deviance as crime; and deviance as sickness.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad|first1=Peter|last2=Schneider |first2=Joseph |title=Deviance and medicalization: from badness to sickness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYpZjDD67dkC&amp;pg=PA36|publisher=Temple University Press|location=|year=1992|page=36|isbn=0-87722-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the [[gay liberation]], [[anti-psychiatry]], and [[feminist movement]]s of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mike|title=From ‘nanny state’ to ‘therapeutic state’|journal=[[The British Journal of General Practice]]|date=August 2004|volume=1|issue=54(505)|pages=645|pmid=15517694|pmc=1324868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt; Feminists, who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt;

According to [[Thomas Szasz]], "the [[Therapeutic State|therapeutic state]] swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion".&lt;ref name="Szasz, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=The Therapeutic State: The Tyranny of Pharmacracy|journal=[[The Independent Review]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=V|issue=4|pages=485–521|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_05_4_szasz.pdf|accessdate=20 January 2012|issn=1086-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|515}}

A '''modular vehicle''' is one in which substantial components of the vehicle are interchangeable. This modularity is intended to make repairs and maintenance easier, or to allow the vehicle to be reconfigured to suit different functions.

Another application of modular vehicle design is to enable the exchange of batteries in an electric vehicle.

In a modular electric vehicle, the power system, wheels and suspension can be contained in a single module or chassis. When the batteries need recharging, the vehicle's body is lifted off and placed onto a fresh power module. By using this ''Modular Vehicle'' system, the vehicle's batteries do not have to be removed or reinstalled, and their connections remain intact.

==History of the modern modular vehicle==
[[File:Ridek3 modular electric vehicle.jpg|thumb|The Ridek III body and chassis can be separated to change body styles or to put the same body on a chassis with fully charged batteries.]]
The world's first road-licensed quick-change modular electric vehicle, based on a patent awarded to Dr Gordon E Dower in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Gordon E, 2000, US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-6059058.html "Modular vehicle construction and transportation system"]&lt;/ref&gt; was shown at the [[World Electric Vehicle Association]] 2003 Electric Vehicle Symposium EVS-20 in Long Beach, California, USA. 

Dower described the vehicle's two parts as its motorized deck, shortened to ''Modek'', and its "containing module" or ''Ridon''. When attached to each other, the vehicle thus formed was dubbed the ''Ridek''. Mechanical connections between the modules for braking and steering automatically engage when the body is lowered on to the chassis.
 
In 2004, General Motors attempted to patent a modular vehicle called ''Autonomy''&lt;ref&gt;Patent application 10/966,548, filed 10/15/2004, assigned General Motors, lead inventor Adrian B Chernoff&lt;/ref&gt; but the attempt was unsuccessful because Dower’s patent already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Patent 10/966/548,denied 2/23/2006, Attorney docket no: GP -3015791/GM0268PUS-1&lt;/ref&gt; 

A team at GM did, however, continue to work on Autonomy, which was intended to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. They unveiled a non-drivable version of their modular vehicle in January 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;King, Ralph, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/10/01/349458/index.htm "GM's Race to the Future - the inside story of how the world's biggest automaker came to see the hydrogen car as its salvation - and took the lead in the engineering challenge of the century"], ''Business 2.0'' Magazine, Oct 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; GM unveiled a drivable prototype, called [[General Motors Hy-wire|Hy-wire]] at the Paris Auto Show in September, 2002.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The name referred to the Hydrogen fuel and the "drive-by-wire" system that electronically connected the vehicle modules for steering, braking and controlling the 4 wheel motors. Hy-wire did not go into production.

==Flexibility==

Modular vehicles make it possible to use different types of bodies, e.g. sedan, sports car or pickup truck, on one standardized chassis.&lt;ref&gt;Chernoff, Adrian B et al, 2003 US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-20030094319.html "Vehicle body interchangeability"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the modular chassis, with its batteries and motor, are relatively easy to work on, since there is no vehicle body to impede access.

==History==
The concept for ''Moon Museum'' was brainstormed by Forrest "Frosty" Myers. He stated that "My idea was to get six great artists together and make a tiny little museum that would be on the moon."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Myers attempted several times to get his project sanctioned by [[NASA]]. He claims the agency gave him the runaround and, Myers states, "They never said no, I just could not get them to say anything."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Instead of going through the official channels, he was forced to take the back route and try to smuggle it on board.
[[File:Moon museum nyt.jpg|thumb|left|Image of the Moon Museum from the original ''New York Times'' article. The thumb obscures Warhol's drawing.]]

Myers contacted [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (E.A.T.), a non-profit group that was linking artists with engineers to create new works. Through E.A.T., Myers was introduced to some scientists from [[Bell Laboratories]], specifically [[Fred Waldhauer]]. Using techniques normally used to produce telephone circuits, the scientists etched the drawings Myers had gathered onto small ceramic wafers. Either 16 or 20 of these wafers were created,&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; with one going on the lunar lander and the rest, copies of the original, handed out to the artists and others involved in the project.&lt;ref name="AOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542 |title=Warhol in Space: Apollo 12 Secretly Carried Art to the Moon |last1=Moye |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=17 June 2010 |website=Aol News |publisher= |access-date=14 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232925/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542|archivedate=18 June 2010|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When NASA dithered whether the wafer would be allowed onto the module, Waldhauer devised another plan. Waldhauer knew a [[Grumman Aircraft]] engineer who was working on the Apollo 12 lander module, and he proved willing to place the wafer on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/aboutpbs/news/20100607_historydetectivesandywarholartonmoon.html PBS' HISTORY DETECTIVES PUTS A QUESTION TO THE NATION: IS ANDY WARHOL’S ART ON THE MOON?]. PBS. June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Myers asked Waldhauer how he would know if the art actually made it onto the lander, and was told that the person who worked for Grumman would send him a [[telegram]] when the wafer was in place. At 3:35 p.m. on November 12, 1969, less than two days before Apollo 12 took off, Myers received a telegram at his house from [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] stating "YOUR ON' A.O.K. ALL SYSTEMS GO," and signed "JOHN F."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The existence of the work was not revealed until Myers informed ''[[The New York Times]]'' which ran an article on the story two days after Apollo 12 left the Moon and two days before they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;[http://greg.org/archive/2008/02/28/the_moon_museum.html Holy ^%$&amp;!

There are six artworks located on the ceramic tile, each one in black and white. Starting in the top center is a single line by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. To its right is a black square with thin white lines intersecting, resembling a piece of circuitry, by David Novros. Below it is  [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]]'s contribution, a template pattern which also resembles circuitry. In the lower middle is a geometric variation on [[Mickey Mouse]], by [[Claes Oldenburg]], a popular motif for the artist at that time.

'''''Otium''''', a [[Latin]] abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's [[retirement]] after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing "active public life". ''Otium'' can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (''negotium'') or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (''i.e.'' speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Julia Conaway |last1=Bondanella |year=2008 |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/clj/BondanellaAbstract.html |title=Petrarch's Rereading of Otium in ''De vita solitaria'' |journal= Comparative Literature |publisher=[[American Comparative Literature Association]] |volume=60 |number=1 |pages=14–28 |accessdate=9 November 2011 |doi=10.1215/-60-1-14 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
In ancient Roman culture ''otium'' was a military concept as its first Latin usage. This was in Ennius' ''Iphigenia.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17–24&lt;/ref&gt;

He who does not know how to use leisure &lt;br&gt; has more of work than when there is work in work. &lt;br&gt; For to whom a task has been set, he does the work, &lt;br&gt;desires it, and delights his own mind and intellect: &lt;br /&gt;in leisure, a mind does not know what it wants.&lt;br /&gt; The same is true (of us); we are neither at home nor in the battlefield; &lt;br /&gt;we go here and there, and wherever there is a movement, we are there too.&lt;br /&gt;

According to historian Carl Deroux in his work ''Studies in Latin literature and Roman history'', the word ''otium'' appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia.&lt;ref&gt;Deroux, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius' first use of the term ''otium'' around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed ''otium negotiosum'' (free time to do what one wanted) and ''otium otiosum'' (idle wasteless free time).&lt;ref name="Langis2"&gt;''[http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S&amp;R_2008_Langis.pdf Leisure, Idleness and Virtuous Activity in Shakespearean Drama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514084059/http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S%26R_2008_Langis.pdf# |date=14 May 2014 }}'' by Unhae Langis, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]], while discussing the word ''praeterpropter'' ("more or less") quotes a fragment of [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', which contrasts ''otium'' with ''negotium'' repeatedly.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0071:book=19:chapter=10 19, 10]. For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as "more or less" ''living''.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant appearance of the word in [[Latin literature]] occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the ''Iphigenia'' of [[Ennius]], where it is contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Ennius, frg. XCIX in the edition of Jocelyn, ''otio qui nescit uti | plus negoti habet quam cum est negotium in negotio'', rendered by Jocelyn: "the man who has no job to do and does not know how to employ the resulting leisure has more difficulty than when there is difficulty in a job on hand". For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of ''otium'' was never a direct translation of the Greek word "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. ''Otium'' is an example of the usage of the term "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war.&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"&gt;Sadlek, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (''i.e.'', winter months, weather not permitting war).&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"/&gt; This was associated with ''otium otiosum'' (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was ''otium negotiosum'' (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying [[hobby]] or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was ''otium privatum'' (private leisure), equal to ''negotium'' (a type of business).&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract "Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium" by Brian Vickers], p. 6 ''The first recorded use of the term is in a fragment from a soldiers' chorus in Ennius' Iphigenia (c. 190 BC), whose preservation we owe to that philologian's ragbag, the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (c. 150 AD) - he cites it as an example of the usage of the word praeterpropter (19.10.12). The soldiers are unoccupied, resting and bored, wanting to return home. They distinguish between otium negotiosum, leisure with a satisfying occupation, which takes place in the city, around the hearth, and otium otiosum, unoccupied and pointless leisure, such as their prolonged stay in the countryside, which they find disorientating. Andre argues that otium originally had military, not pastoral associations, referring to the enforced inactivity that coincided each year with the dead months of winter (especially January and February), unsuitable for war, farming or fishing.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest citation for ''otium'' is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17-24, The tragedy is [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', ''apud'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0071%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D10 19, 10] (a discussion of a different word in the same fragment).&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (''otium'') than to be idle doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons&lt;ref name="Bernard16"&gt;Bernard, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; - a time for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Even though originally ''otium'' was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons,&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"&gt;Bright, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, pp 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of ''otium'' as a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of ancient Roman considered ''otium'' a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paoli, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and [[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]] point out the only legitimate form of ''otium'' was transpired with intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Almasi, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otium'' was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (''negotium'') and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek philosophers ==
[[File:Epikur2.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]] ]]

The favorable sense of ''otium'' in [[Cicero]]nian Latin reflects the Greek term {{lang|grc|σχολή}} (''skholē'', "leisure", a meaning retained in [[Modern Greek]] as σχόλη, ''schólē''); "leisure" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the [[kalos kagathos|Athenian gentleman]]: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became "discussion", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. [[Plato]] (and his contemporaries, if the ''[[Greater Hippias]]'' be not authentic) brought ''schole'' into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the ''Greater Hippias'', it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henry Smith, ''The new nobility: A prolegomenon to Plato's "Greater Hippias"'' 2007; pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the [[Academy]], they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the [[New Academy]] of [[Carneades]] practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy lasted nearly a thousand years; different authors divide its history differently. For the text, see, ''inter permulta alia'', R. J. Hankinson, ''The Skeptics'', pp. 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] and [[Dicaearchus]], students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"/&gt;

Roman Epicureans used ''otium'' for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"&gt;Haase, p. 2265&lt;/ref&gt; An Epicurean proverb {{cquote|
''It is better to lie on the naked ground and be at ease, than to have a golden coach and a rich table and be worried.''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenmeyer, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The phrase "to be at ease" can have the meaning "to be of good cheer" or "to be without fear" {{mdash}} these being interdependent. The [[Epicurean]] idea of ''otium'' favors contemplation,&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (''i.e.'' sailors). The rustic ''otium'' concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism.  The active city public life of ''negotium'' and an ''otium'' of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].

[[Epicurus]]'s philosophy was contrary to [[Stoicism|Hellenistic Stoicism]]. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of ''otium''.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"/&gt; The concept of the Epicurean ''otium'' (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in [[Epicureanism|Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden]]. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in "The Garden" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean ''otium'' and the  Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of ''otium'' (''i.e.'' private or public; contemplation or "employment"; ''otium'' or ''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Republic ==
In early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, ''otium'' is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to ''officium'', "office, duty" than to ''negotium'' ('business"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then ''otium'' meant "leisure" while ''negotium'' meant "non-leisure" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of ''otium'' was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. ''Otium '' and ''negotium'' was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of ''otium'' was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter,&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 20-22,  35-36, 79-81, 421, 434-437&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the business (''negotium'') of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual ''otium.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows that the beauty of the individual ''otium'' poses rest.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 514 ''beaute de l'otium individuel poesie du repos.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Maccius Plautus]] in his play ''[[Mercator (play)|Mercator]]'' says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim ''tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames'' (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0102%3Aact%3D3%3Ascene%3D2 T. Maccius Plautus, Mercator (3.2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroEpistulaeAdFamiliaresVenice1547page329Detail.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Cicero busy at work]]

[[Cicero]] speaks of himself, with the expression ''otium cum dignitate'', that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Chaim |last1=Wirszubski |journal=The [[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=44|year=1954 |pages=1–13|title=Cicero's CVM Dignitate Otivm: A Reconsideration |jstor=637589 |doi=10.2307/297549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/637589 AUCTORITAS, DIGNITAS, OTIUM]&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ousted from  each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for "worthy leisure". During this time he composed ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', a series of books on [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"&gt;Stroup, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero defines ''otium'' as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of "public health".&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt; It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book ''On Duties'' that when the city life becomes [[Frustration|too much]], one should retreat to the country for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Prosperetti, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''otium cum dignitate'' in Cicero's ''Pro Sestio'' was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some.&lt;ref&gt;Wirszubski, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero says in ''Pro Sestio'', XLV., 98{{cquote|
''Id quod est praestantissimum, maximeque optabile omnibus sanis et bonis et beatis, cum dignitate otium.''&lt;br /&gt;That which stands first, and is most to be desired by all happy, honest and healthy-minded men, is ease with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Harbottle, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and ''otium''. In one passage of ''[[De Oratore]]'' he explains that [[Philistus]] spent his retirement writing history as his ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book ii. 13.57&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say in ''De Oratore'' Book iii that other men passed their ''otium'' of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, [[knucklebones]], dice games or just games they made up. Others that were "retired" from public life for whatever reason devoted their ''otium cum seritio'' (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book iii.15.57&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Klaus Bringmann]] shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a [[hypocrite]] while in ''otium''  because of his sense of duty to serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, pp. 77-78 ''Cicero on "otium"...   Bringmann presents a view of Cicero in which his unwavering sense of duty ...''

It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (''desidia'') had derogatory implications and unqualified ''otium'' was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with ''negotia publica'', participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''off.'' 3.1; ''Brut.'' 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish between plain "idleness" and aristocratic ''otium homestum'', ''otium liberale'' or ''otium cum dignitate'', writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to ''res publica'' (the general public).  These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc. 1.5; 5.105; ''fam'' 1.9.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Cat.'' 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero praises [[Cato the Elder]] for his respectful use of ''otium'' in  his expression ''non minus otii quam negotii'' (no less for doing nothing than business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x | volume=4 | title=Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium | year=1990 | journal=Renaissance Studies | pages=1–37 [7] | last1 = Vickers | first1 = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero was associating ''otium'' with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed he was ''never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.''&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Cicero in his ''[[De Officiis]]'' (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus ''Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a [[goad]].''  Cicero's idea of ''otium cum dignitate'' (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of "free time" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (''otium'') available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of [[hobby|hobbies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bereday, p. 60 &amp; 156&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero has a number of different concept versions for ''otium''. In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (''maximos labores'') should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Vasaly, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catullus]], a late [[Roman Republic]] poet, in his poems shows that the significance of ''otium'' of the middle Republican time of [[autonomy]] into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark ''otium'' with erotic influence.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt;

=== Imperial Rome ===
[[File:GNM - Römische Villa.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reconstruction of a Roman villa]]
The imperial dictatorship by [[Augustus]] during the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (''otium'') because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 123, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The home of choice (''domus'') then became the countryside [[villa]] as the rise of the [[Roman Empire]] made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-style architecture became their new [[Roman villa|villa otium]] outside of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/arts/12iht-otium.1.16069552.html?pagewanted=all |title=The pursuit of leisure and the rise of the Roman villa|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times the "otium villa " was a [[Dionysian]] idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (''otium'') in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The "villa with a garden" and "villa by the sea" was associated with ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
The life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a "superior world" of living.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Roman poet [[Statius]] writes of a "otium villa" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work ''[[Silvae]]'': ''It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure,  non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...''&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 3.5.85-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in ''otium'' of the time by the life he lived from his "otium villas". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |title=The Roman Villa |access-date=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620235350/http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |archive-date=20 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibullus]] was an [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac]] poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his [[Tibullus#Extant works|existing first two books of poetry]] he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]] as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, ''adsiduus labor'', and military service (''militia''). He shows in his poetry that originally ''otium'' was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons.&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"/&gt; Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (''interdum'') and therefore inserts ''otium'' (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life.&lt;ref name="Myers73"&gt;Myers, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ''ignobile otium'' (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee-Stecum, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of ''otium''. He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]] as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward ''otium''. The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that ''otium'' is not really "free time", but a study of other matters (''i.e.'', reading, writing) other than political and career gains.&lt;ref&gt;Trapp, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by ''otium liberale'' (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De otio, De brevitate vitae, De tranquillitate animi, ep.'' 82.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''epp.'' 1.22; 9.3&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of ''otium ruris'' (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''epod.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''g.'' 2.475–540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''dial.'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'' describes retirement from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Erskine, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on ''otium'' (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref name="Bernard16"/&gt;

These are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'':
# virtue, freedom and happiness by reasoning.
# the military metaphor.
# that the virtuous person chooses ''statio'', a specific place for doing one's 'employment'.
# ''otium'' (leisure) is still ''negotium'' (business) even if withdrawal from public activity.
# that the virtuous person's ''otium'', as a citizen of the universe, is the field for the performance of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later writers ===

[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|125px|&lt;center&gt;Augustine studying]]

While Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of [[Athenodorus of Soli|Athenodorus]]'s ''De Tranquillitate'' it is basically different. In ''De Otio 3.5'' Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in ''De Tranquillitate'' the theme is peace of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] reminded Romans of ''otium philosophandi'', a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that ''otium'' was the prerequisite for contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of ''otium'' that [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described ''Christianae vita otium'' as the Christian life of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of ''otium'' as the [[deadly sin]] of [[acedia]] (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated ''otium'' as meaning to serve God through deep thought.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary, ''Trin.'' 1.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; These same Christian writers also showed ''otium ruris'' (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic ''propositum''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulinus of Nola, ''ep.'' 5.4; ''carm.'' 10.166&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine describes the monastic life as ''otium sanctum'' (sanctified leisure or approved leisure).&lt;ref name="Enarrations"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/augustine/textstrans.html |title=Enarrations on the Psalms |page=220.3 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - ''negotium'') and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - ''otium'').&lt;ref name="Prosperetti 48"&gt;Prosperetti, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]], 14th-century poet and [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]], discusses ''otium'' in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees ''otium'' not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|100 px|left|&lt;center&gt;Petrarca]]

Petrarch considered solitude (''i.e.'', rural setting, "villa otium", [[Philippe de Cabassoles#The best friend of Petrarch|his Vaucluse home]]) and its relationship to ''otium'' as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said "no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it."&lt;ref&gt;Kleist, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of ''otium'':

{{cquote|''...&amp;nbsp;ought it not to be my first aim to have my leisure as remote from idleness as my life is from active affairs?''&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;}}
Petrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in ''otium'' (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's ''Vetus Itala'' in ''De otio religioso'' where in [[Christianity]] it was associated with contemplation and ''vacatio'' (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with ''videre'' (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of ''otium'' as ''vacate et videte'' (be still and see—a form of [[meditation]], contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Marvell]]’s seventeenth-century poem [[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]] is a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] of nine [[stanzas]] in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to ''otium''. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows ''otium'' to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized ''otium'' with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.&lt;ref name="Vickers5"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}; page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

What wondrous life is this I lead! &lt;br /&gt;
Ripe apples drop about my head; &lt;br /&gt;
The luscious clusters of the vine &lt;br /&gt;
Upon my mouth do crush their wine; &lt;br /&gt;
The nectarine and curious peach &lt;br /&gt;
Into my hands themselves do reach; &lt;br /&gt;
Stumbling on melons as I pass,&lt;br /&gt;
Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.

Meanwhile, mind, from pleasure less, &lt;br /&gt;
Withdraws into its happiness: &lt;br /&gt;
The mind, that ocean where each kind &lt;br /&gt;
Does straight its own resemblance find; &lt;br /&gt;
Yet it creates, transcending these, &lt;br /&gt;
Far other worlds, and other seas; &lt;br /&gt;
Annihilating all that's made &lt;br /&gt;
To a green thought in a green shade.

Here at the fountain's sliding foot, &lt;br /&gt;
Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root, &lt;br /&gt;
Casting the body's vest aside, &lt;br /&gt;
My soul into the boughs does glide: &lt;br /&gt;
There like a bird it sits and sings, &lt;br /&gt;
Then whets and combs its silver wings; &lt;br /&gt;
And, till prepared for longer flight, &lt;br /&gt;
Waves in its plumes the various light.

Such was that happy garden-state, &lt;br /&gt;
While man there walked without a mate: &lt;br /&gt;
After a place so pure and sweet, &lt;br /&gt;
What other help could yet be meet! &lt;br /&gt;
But 'twas beyond a mortal's share &lt;br /&gt;
To wander solitary there: &lt;br /&gt;
Two paradises 'twere in one &lt;br /&gt;
To live in Paradise alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/marvell/garden.htm The Garden by Andrew Marvell]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]], a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of ''otium'' in his 1878 publication ''[[Human, All Too Human|Menschliches, Allzumenschliches]]'':{{cquote|
Scholars are ashamed of ''otium.'' But there is something noble about leisure and idleness. {{mdash}} If idleness really is the beginning of all vice, then it is at any rate in the closest proximity to all virtue; the idle man is always a better man than the active. {{mdash}} But when I speak of leisure and idleness, you do not think I am alluding to you, do you, you sluggards?&lt;ref name="Vickers1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}; page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Nietzsche, ''Menschliches, Allzumenschliches.'' 1.284, 'Zu Gunsten der Müssigen', in Friedrich Nietzsche, Sämtliche Werke, ed.

If idleness is really the beginning of all vice, it finds itself, therefore, at least in near neighbourhood of all the virtues; the idle man is still a better man than the active. You do not suppose that in speaking of idleness and idlers I am alluding to you, you sluggards?''&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Private life and public life meanings ==
Private life meaning of ''otium'' meant personal [[retirement]]—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of "active public life". One would not be a historian in this case.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=637589 |title= Auctoritas, Dignitas, Otium |first1=J. P. V. D. |last1=Balsdon |authorlink= |doi= |publisher= Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=43–50 |date=May 1960 }}; page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In public life ''otium'' meant public peace and relief after war.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war).&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the ''[[status quo]]'': acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Sestio'' 98; cf. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]], '''parametric polymorphism''' is a way to make a language more expressive, while still maintaining full static [[type-safety]]. Using parametric [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], a function or a data type can be written generically so that it can handle values ''identically'' without depending on their type.{{sfn|Pierce|2002}} Such functions and data types are called '''generic functions''' and '''generic datatypes''' respectively and form the basis of [[generic programming]].

For example, a function &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; that joins two lists can be constructed so that it does not care about the type of elements: it can append lists of integers, lists of real numbers, lists of strings, and so on. Let the ''type variable a'' denote the type of elements in the lists. Then &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; can be typed 
:&lt;code&gt;forall a. [a] &amp;times; [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt; denotes the type of lists with elements of type ''a''. We say that the type of &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; is ''parameterized by a'' for all values of ''a''. (Note that since there is only one type variable, the function cannot be applied to just any pair of lists: the pair, as well as the result list, must consist of the same type of elements.) For each place where &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; is applied, a value is decided for ''a''.

Following [[Christopher Strachey]],{{sfn|Strachey|1967}} parametric polymorphism may be contrasted with [[ad hoc polymorphism]], in which a single polymorphic function can have a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. Thus, ad hoc polymorphism can generally only support a limited number of such distinct types, since a separate implementation has to be provided for each type.

== History ==
Parametric polymorphism was first introduced to programming languages in [[ML programming language|ML]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, R., Morris, L., Newey, M. "A Logic for Computable Functions with reflexive and polymorphic types", ''Proc. Conference on Proving and Improving Programs'', Arc-et-Senans (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Today it exists in [[Standard ML]], [[OCaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]], [[Visual Prolog]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], and others. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[Object Pascal|Delphi]] have each introduced "generics" for parametric polymorphism. Some implementations of type polymorphism are superficially similar to parametric polymorphism while also introducing ad hoc aspects. One example is [[C++]] [[template specialization]].

The most general form of polymorphism is "higher-rank [[impredicative]] polymorphism". Two popular restrictions of this form are restricted rank polymorphism (for example, rank-1 or ''prenex'' polymorphism) and predicative polymorphism. Together, these restrictions give "predicative prenex polymorphism", which is essentially the form of polymorphism found in ML and early versions of Haskell.

== Higher-ranked polymorphism ==

=== Rank-1 (prenex) polymorphism ===
In a ''[[prenex]] polymorphic'' system, type variables may not be instantiated with polymorphic types. This is very similar to what is called "ML-style" or "Let-polymorphism" (technically ML's Let-polymorphism has a few other syntactic restrictions).
This restriction makes the distinction between polymorphic and non-polymorphic types very important; thus in predicative systems polymorphic types are sometimes referred to as ''type schemas'' to distinguish them from ordinary (monomorphic) types, which are sometimes called ''monotypes''. A consequence is that all types can be written in a form that places all quantifiers at the outermost (prenex) position.
For example, consider the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; function described above, which has type 
:&lt;code&gt;forall a. [a]&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;[a]&amp;nbsp;-&gt;&amp;nbsp;[a]&lt;/code&gt;
In order to apply this function to a pair of lists, a type must be substituted for the variable ''a'' in the type of the function such that the type of the arguments matches up with the resulting function type. In an ''impredicative'' system, the type being substituted may be any type whatsoever, including a type that is itself polymorphic; thus &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; can be applied to pairs of lists with elements of any type—even to lists of polymorphic functions such as &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; itself.
Polymorphism in the language ML and its close relatives is predicative. This is because predicativity, together with other restrictions, makes the [[type system]] simple enough that [[type inference]] is possible. In languages where explicit type annotations are necessary when applying a polymorphic function, the predicativity restriction is less important; thus these languages are generally impredicative.

=== Rank-''k'' polymorphism ===
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
For some fixed value ''k'', rank-''k'' polymorphism is a system in which a quantifier may not appear to the left of ''k'' or more arrows (when the type is drawn as a tree).{{sfn|Pierce|2002}}

[[Type inference]] for rank-2 polymorphism is decidable, but reconstruction for rank-3 and above is not.{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=359}}

=== Rank-''n'' ("higher-rank") polymorphism ===
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
Rank-''n'' polymorphism is polymorphism in which quantifiers may appear to the left of arbitrarily many arrows.

== Predicativity and impredicativity ==

=== Predicative polymorphism ===
In a predicative parametric polymorphic system, a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; containing a type variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; may not be used in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is instantiated to a polymorphic type. Predicative type theories include [[Intuitionistic Type Theory|Martin-Löf Type Theory]] and [[NuPRL]].

=== Impredicative polymorphism ===
''Impredicative polymorphism'' (also called ''first-class polymorphism'') is the most powerful form of parametric polymorphism.{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=340}} A definition is said to be [[impredicativity|impredicative]] if it is self-referential; in type theory this allows the instantiation of a variable in a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; with any type, including polymorphic types, such as &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; itself. An example of this is the [[System F]] with the type variable ''X'' in the type &lt;math&gt;T = \forall X. X \to X&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' could even refer to ''T'' itself.

In [[type theory]], the most frequently studied impredicative [[typed lambda calculus|typed λ-calculi]] are based on those of the [[lambda cube]], especially [[System F]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002}}

== Bounded parametric polymorphism ==
{{main|Bounded quantification}}
In 1985, [[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]] recognized the advantages of allowing ''bounds'' on the type parameters.{{sfn|Cardelli|Wegner|1985}} Many operations require some knowledge of the data types, but can otherwise work parametrically. For example, to check whether an item is included in a list, we need to compare the items for equality. In [[Standard ML]], type parameters of the form ''’’a'' are restricted so that the equality operation is available, thus the function would have the type ''’’a'' × ''’’a'' list → bool and ''’’a'' can only be a type with defined equality. In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], bounding is achieved by requiring types to belong to a [[type class]]; thus the same function has the type &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle Eq \, \alpha \, \Rightarrow \alpha \, \rightarrow \left[\alpha \right] \rightarrow Bool}&lt;/math&gt; in Haskell. In most object-oriented programming languages that support parametric polymorphism, parameters can be constrained to be [[subtype]]s of a given type (see [[Subtype polymorphism]] and the article on [[Generic programming]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1230">The '''principle of distributivity''' states that the algebraic [[distributive law]] is [[Validity (logic)|valid]] for [[classical logic]], where both [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] are distributive over each other so that for any [[proposition]]s ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]]s
:&lt;math&gt;A \land (B \lor C) \iff (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;A \lor (B \land C) \iff (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Problem-solving courts''' (PSC) address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior and are a current trend in the legal system of the [[United States]]. In 1989, a judge in Miami began to take a hands-on approach to drug addicts, ordering them into treatment, rather than perpetuating the revolving door of court and prison. The result was creation of [[drug court]], a [[diversion program]]. That same concept began to be applied to difficult situations where legal, social and human problems mesh.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=In Problem-Solving Court, Judges Turn Therapist| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/nyregion/26courts.html |accessdate=10 April 2012| newspaper=New York Times|date=April 26, 2005| author=Kaufman, Leslie| author2=Eaton, Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=A New Way of doing Business|journal=Journal of Court Innovation|date=Summer 2009|format=PDF|pages=1|url=https://www.bja.gov/publications/cci_ps_roundtable.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce [[recidivism]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Efforts ==
[[Judith Kaye]] was [[Chief Judge]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1993–2008 where she was most responsible for implementing court reform utilizing problem-solving courts in her state, one of the first in the nation. She also co-founded the [[Center for Court Innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org |title=The Center for Court Innovation |publisher=Courtinnovation.org |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a non-profit [[think tank]] headquartered in New York that helps courts and criminal justice agencies decrease crime, provide aid to victims and increase the public's confidence in the justice system.&lt;ref name="Center for Court Innovation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/10th_Anniversary1.pdf |title=A Decade of Change: The First 10 Years of the Center for Court Innovation|format=PDF |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Center for Court Innovation researchers explored whether problem-solving justice always requires a specialized court or if core principles and practices from these specialized courts are transferable to conventional courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/Applying%20Problem-SolvingModel.pdf|title=Applying the problem-solving model outside of problem-solving courts |format=PDF |publisher=Judicature}}&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing judges, attorneys and representatives from probation departments and service providers, researchers concluded that a number of principles—such as judicial monitoring and linking offenders to services—could be transferable. The study, conducted in cooperation with the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee of the Judicial Council of California, was the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/California_Story.pdf|title=California's Collaborative Justice Courts|publisher=Courtinfo.ca.gov|format=PDF|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, [[The New Press]] published ''Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman |first=Greg |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565849736/ |title=Good Courts: The Case For Problem-solving Justice (9781565849730): Greg Berman, John Feinblatt, Sarah Glazer: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to describe the problem-solving court movement in detail, ''Good Courts'' features profiles of Center demonstration projects. The book is being used in law schools and public policy schools, due in part to a law school course on problem-solving justice that the Center piloted at [[Fordham Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research/Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/research/good-courts-case-problem-solving-justice-0|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PSJ-course&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/psjlawschoolcourse.pdf |title=Problem-Solving Justice: A Law School Course |format=PDF |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Association of Drug Court Professionals]] had more than 25,000 members working in 2,663 drug courts and 1,219 other problem-solving courts as of late 2011. Their annual conference offers education and training from experts for problem-solving professionals world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NADCP 18th Annual Training Conference|url=http://www.policyoptions.org/camden/article/nadcp-18th-annual-training-conference|publisher=Policy Options, Inc.|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both problem-solving courts and the use of [[therapeutic jurisprudence]] greatly improved the outcomes of most cases. Programs have been established for [[teen court]], [[DWI court]], re-entry court&lt;ref name=Re&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=Reentry Courts: Looking Ahead|url=https://www.bja.gov/Publications/CCI_ReentryCourts.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Justice Assistance|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community court]], [[Domestic violence court]], Sex offense court,&lt;ref name=SEX&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Kristine|title=Sex Offense Courts: The Next Step in Community Management?|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/research/sex-offense-courts-next-step-community-management|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental health court]], and [[veterans' court]].&lt;ref name=VETS&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMichael|first=William H.|title=The Battle on the Home Front: Special Courts Turn to Vets to Help Other Vets|journal=ABA Journal|date=November 1, 2011|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_battle_on_the_home_front_special_courts_turn_to_vets_to_help_other_vets/|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
According to the Center for Court Innovation, there are six principles required for problem-solving courts to be effective. There must be ''better information'' available to the staff through training, and comprehensive defendant information for justice officials.
''Community engagement'' with the public will encourage cooperation of witnesses, jurors, &amp; community watch groups, and foster trust.
''Collaboration'' between legal officials (judges/prosecutors/attorneys/probation officers), social service providers, victim groups and schools will keep everyone focused on the goal.
''Individualized Justice'' links offenders to the services they need and provides services for victims to aid in their recovery.
Offenders must be held ''accountable'' with compliance monitoring and consequences for non-compliance.
''Outcomes'' need to be analyzed for cost versus benefit, and to provide continuous improvement of the process.&lt;ref name=Prin&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=Principles of Problem Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/topic/problem-solving-justice |publisher=Bureau of Justice Assistance|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences ==
Problem-solving courts look just like traditional courts, but defendants are referred to as "clients" and the judge has extensive knowledge about the client and talks with them directly. A client placed in a treatment program is monitored by the judge for months or years, and will return to court periodically to assess progress and/or problems. The judge can order the client to serve jail time as a punishment while in a treatment program, and the judge decides when the client is to be released from the program.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Criticism ==
A 2005 article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that because judges have total discretion, the results can be inconsistent. When that situation existed in the criminal justice system, mandatory sentencing guidelines were instituted. Legal scholars have warned that judges may also force their values upon defendants from different cultures. Those critical of the system say many treatment programs are unnecessarily harsh, and any deviation from the rules is punished.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Some public defenders have criticized the use of problem-solving courts because accused persons who accept intervention are implicitly treated as guilty; the courts do not allow an accused person to receive a determination of innocence or guilt.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; New York Supreme Court Judge James A. Yates has characterized their use as a trend toward "an inquisitorial system of justice".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Judges in problem-solving courts need other skills beyond a knowledge of the law; they also must sometimes function as a social worker, therapist, and accountant. Law schools have only recently begun to provide courses on problem-solving justice,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=PSJ-course /&gt; and New York Judge Fern Fisher commented that not all judges have the patience and attitude necessary to be effective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Federal guidance ==
The [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]] (BJA) is the branch of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] tasked with proving the concept and providing guidelines to state court systems that seek to implement a program. The BJA identified ten projects and provided funding to demonstrate the theories in practice and document their results. They also provide hands-on assistance for any judicial entity seeking to establish a problem-solving court.&lt;ref name=PSJ-site&gt;{{cite web|title=Problem-Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/topic/problem-solving-justice|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Disk to Sphere using Quotient Space.gif|thumb|Illustration of quotient space, [[N-sphere|{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], obtained by ''gluing'' the boundary (in blue) of the [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} together to a single point.]]
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''quotient space''' (also called an '''identification space''') is, intuitively speaking, the result of identifying or "gluing together" certain points of a given [[topological space]]. The points to be identified are specified by an [[equivalence relation]]. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones. The '''quotient topology''' consists of all sets with an [[open set|open]] [[preimage]] under the [[canonical projection map]] that maps each element to its equivalence class.

== Definition ==
Let {{math|(''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a [[topological space]], and let {{math|~}} be an [[equivalence relation]] on {{math|''X''}}. The '''quotient space''', {{math|1=''Y'' = ''X'' / ~}} is defined to be the set of [[equivalence class]]es of elements of {{math|''X''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \Big\{ [x] : x \in X \Big\} = \Big\{\{v \in X : v \sim x\} : x \in X\Big\},&lt;/math&gt;
equipped with the topology where the open sets are defined to be those sets of equivalence classes whose unions are open sets in ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y = \Bigl\{ {\textstyle U \subseteq Y : \bigcup U = \bigl( \bigcup_{ [a] \in U} [a] \bigr) \in \tau_X }\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, we can define them to be those sets with an open preimage under the surjective map {{math|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X'' / ~}}, which sends a point in {{math|''X''}} to the equivalence class containing it:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y=\left\{ U \subseteq Y : q^{-1}(U) \in \tau_X \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The quotient topology is the [[final topology]] on the quotient space with respect to the  map {{math|''q''}}.

== Quotient map ==
A map &lt;math&gt;f: X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''quotient map''' (sometimes called an '''identification map''') if it is [[surjective function|surjective]], and a subset ''U'' of ''Y'' is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map if it is onto and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with the [[final topology]]  with respect to  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Given an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map &lt;math&gt;q: X \to X/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map.

== Examples ==
*'''Gluing'''.  Topologists talk of gluing points together.  If ''X'' is a topological space and points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt; are to be "glued", then what is meant is that we are to consider the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}} or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''x'', ''b'' = ''y''}} (or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''y'', ''b'' = ''x''}}).
*Consider the unit square {{nowrap|1=''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,1] × [0,1]}} and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then ''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[sphere|unit sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*'''[[Adjunction space]]'''. More generally, suppose ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. One can identify all points in ''A'' to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of ''A'' equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted ''X''/''A''. The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to the unit disc with its boundary identified to a single point: &lt;math&gt;D^{2}/\partial{D^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Consider the set &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of all [[real number]]s with the ordinary topology, and write {{nowrap|1=''x'' ~ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|''x'' − ''y''}} is an [[integer]]. Then the quotient space ''X''/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to exp(2π''ix'').
*A generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a [[topological group]] ''G'' [[group action|acts]] continuously on a space ''X''. One can form an equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]. The quotient space under this relation is called the '''orbit space''', denoted ''X''/''G''. In the previous example {{nowrap|1=''G'' = '''Z'''}} acts on '''R''' by translation. The orbit space '''R'''/'''Z''' is homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

''Note'': The notation '''R'''/'''Z''' is somewhat ambiguous. If '''Z''' is understood to be a group acting on '''R''' via addition, then the [[Quotient group|quotient]] is the circle. However, if '''Z''' is thought of as a subspace of '''R''', then the quotient is a countably infinite [[bouquet of circles]] joined at a single point.

== Properties ==
Quotient maps {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if ''Z'' is any topological space and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is any function, then ''f'' is continuous if and only if {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''q''}} is continuous.

[[Image:QuotientSpace-01.svg|center|Characteristic property of the quotient topology]]

The quotient space ''X''/~ together with the quotient map {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X''/~}} is characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''Z''}} is a continuous map such that {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b'')}} for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', then there exists a unique continuous map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''/~ → ''Z''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''q''}}. We say that ''g'' ''descends to the quotient''.

The continuous maps defined on ''X''/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on ''X'' that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is copiously used when studying quotient spaces.

Given a continuous surjection {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if ''q'' is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that ''q'' be [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]]. Note that these conditions are only [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], not [[necessary condition|necessary]]. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps that are neither open nor closed. For topological groups, the  quotient map is open.

== Compatibility with other topological notions ==
* [[Separation axioms|Separation]]
** In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of ''X'' need not be inherited by ''X''/~, and ''X''/~ may have separation properties not shared by ''X''.
** ''X''/~ is a [[T1 space]] if and only if every equivalence class of ~ is closed in ''X''.
** If the quotient map is [[open map|open]], then ''X''/~ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the [[product space]] ''X''&amp;times;''X''.
* [[Connectedness]]
** If a space is connected or [[path connected]], then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[simply connected]] or [[contractible]] space need not share those properties.
* [[Compact space|Compactness]]
** If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[locally compact]] space need not be locally compact.
* [[Dimension]]
** The [[topological dimension]] of a quotient space can be more (as well as less) than the dimension of the original space; [[space-filling curve]]s provide such examples.

''Rapid serial visual presentation'' is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm requires participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are placed inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items known as distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.

==Overview==
There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds. A person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one. The first number which is an important target, would be caught by the person, however, the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed. RSVP asks the question, What would reading be like if there were no eye movements? A text is delivered at a spot on the screen, like a series of flash cards. The user can set how long each card is to be displayed. The readers are liberated from having to decide how much time to spend on each word because that is set in advance, and saccades, regressive eye movements, line sweeps, and page turning have been eliminated. A reader can fully concentrate on comprehending the text as it flashes through, however, with longer texts the reading experience is found to be monotonous and exhausting. There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception. The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times. With the attentional blink, the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend, interpret, and store the information properly. The human brain is capable of processing complex tasks, but it has restrictions. The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information. An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag, but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag.  The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target.

==History==

Potter (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.2.5.509| title = Short-term conceptual memory for pictures| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 509–522| year = 1976| last1 = Potter | first1 = M. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the amount people who are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli. Potter had participants search for the RSVP series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target. This was depicted before the appearance of the RSVP series. Results showed that participants performed well on this task. Here, the RSVP rate was eight items per second; however, participants were still able to accurately find the target on 75% of the trials. Performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described. Each picture was acknowledged within 125 milliseconds. However, Potter &amp; Levy (1969) found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the RSVP sequence. The results showed that the participants’ performance accurately scored 10% in the task when the RSVP rate was eight items per second.

Sperling and colleagues  examined the RSVP paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention (e.g., Reeves &amp; Sperling, 1986; Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.180| pmid = 3714927| title = Attention gating in short-term visual memory| journal = Psychological Review| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 180–206| year = 1986| last1 = Reeves | first1 = A. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=G|author2=Weichselgartner, E. |title=Episodic theory of the dynamics of spatial attention|journal=Psychological Review|year=1995|volume=102|pages=503–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004). Sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two RSVP series were presented altogether. There was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point. One series contained letters and the other series contained numbers. The object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter. Results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around 400 milliseconds after the cue. They concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one RSVP series. Participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter. Results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around 400 milliseconds after the letter was presented. No spatial shift of attention was required. Participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item.

Broadbent and Broadbent (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03210498| title = From detection to identification: Response to multiple targets in rapid serial visual presentation| journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 105–13| year = 1987| last1 = Broadbent | first1 = D.

P. | pmid=3627930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discovered the attentional blink when they used a rapid serial visual presentation task to look at the recognition of multiple target words. Results showed that following the presence of a target, attentional processing is restricted and people can’t report the items that came after the target, however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness. This concludes that when two targets are shown within 500 milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors, the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen.

[[Inattentional blindness]] as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation. Rees, Russell, Frith, and Driver (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5449.2504| pmid = 10617465| title = Inattentional Blindness Versus Inattentional Amnesia for Fixated but Ignored Words| journal = Science| volume = 286| issue = 5449| pages = 2504–7| year = 1999| last1 = Rees | first1 = G.| last2 = Russell| first2 = C| last3 = Frith| first3 = C.

Participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed. They found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing.

==Modes==

There are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Robert|title=Rapid Serial Visual Presentation: Design for Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447150855|author2=Witkowski, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modes is the static mode. Here, the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving. The other mode, the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially, move about the display and then disappear.

===Static mode===
The pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations.  Pictures are shown one by one at the same rate. Here, participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds. This is an advantage of this static mode. A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen.  The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300-400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen. The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: steady gaze, search to steady and visual search.

===Moving modes===
We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane. These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth. The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world. This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects. The moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: diagonal, stream and ring.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Advantages over conventional reading==
The unique method used by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/571985.572014| chapter = Web ''Thumb''| title = Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02| pages = 205| year = 2002| last1 = Wobbrock | first1 = J. O. | last2 = Forlizzi | first2 = J. | last3 = Hudson | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Myers | first4 = B. A. | isbn = 1581134886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45756-9_18| chapter = Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation| title = Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices| volume = 2411| pages = 225| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2002| last1 = Öquist | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-44189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by about 20% versus display at 250 WPM, from a score of 74.6 to 52.1, resulting in an effective 82% increase in words comprehended per minute, assuming the scoring is linear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D. G.| last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. A.| last3 = Freeman | first3 = J.| last4 = Su | first4 = M.| last5 = Berger | first5 = T. D.| last6 = Majaj | first6 = N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and limitations==

Several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation. The RSVP can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand. The memory load for each individual differs and can be high, because using RSVP, more attention is needed. Also, RSVP allows us to miss vital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 3672124

| pages = 778–80
| last2 = Sperling
| first2 = G
 | doi=10.1126/science.3672124
}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP also often results with [[repetition blindness]] during use. When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other disadvantages include [[attentional blink]], in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence, {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as [[temporal masking]], causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Web browsing on small-screen devices===

Using RSVP-based browsers offers a space–time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDAs. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like 'Where am I', 'Where can I usefully go', 'Where have I been' and 'How do I get back to X', need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007790200024| title = RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices| journal = Personal and Ubiquitous Computing| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 245–252| year = 2002| last1 = De Bruijn | first1 = O.| last2 = Spence | first2 = R.| last3 = Chong | first3 = M. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.

===Peripheral reading===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D.

===Adolescent sexual offenders===
Limited existing previous research by Beech et al. suggests that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink.  A stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  However, this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1079063208328677| title = Applying Rapid Serial Visual Presentation to Adolescent Sexual Offenders: Attentional Bias as a Measure of Deviant Sexual Interest?| journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 135–148| year = 2009| last1 = Crooks | first1 = V.

'''Root cause analysis''' ('''RCA''') is a method of [[problem solving]] used for identifying the [[root cause]]s of faults or problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Paul F.|last2=Dell|first2=Larry D.|last3=Anderson|first3=Gaylord F.|title=Root Cause Analysis: A Tool for Total Quality Management|date=1993|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87389-163-5|pages=8–17|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A factor is considered a root cause if removal thereof from the problem-fault-sequence prevents the final undesirable outcome from recurring; whereas a causal factor is one that affects an event's outcome, but is not a root cause.  Though removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence with certainty.

Essentially it is based on four general principles,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended throughout this article:

* Define and describe properly the event or problem ([[5 Whys|'five whys' technique]]).
* Establish a timeline from normal situation until the final crisis or failure.
* Distinguish between root causes and causal factor.
* Once implemented (and with constant execution), RCA is transformed into a method of problem prediction.

== Uses ==
RCA is applied to methodically identify and correct the root causes of events, rather than to simply address the symptomatic result.  Focusing correction on root causes has the goal of entirely preventing problem recurrence.  Conversely, RCFA (Root Cause Failure Analysis) recognizes that complete prevention of recurrence by one corrective action is not always possible.

RCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. Analysis is done ''after'' an event has occurred. Insights in RCA make it potentially useful as a preemptive method. In that event, RCA can be used to ''forecast'' or predict probable events even ''before'' they occur. While one follows the other, RCA is a completely separate process to [[incident management]].

== Examples ==
For example, imagine a fictional segment of students who received poor testing scores. After initial investigation, it was verified that students taking tests in the final period of the school day got lower scores. Further investigation revealed that late in the day, the students lacked ability to focus. Even further investigation revealed that the reason for the lack of focus was hunger. So, the root cause of the poor testing scores was hunger, remedied by moving the testing time to soon after lunch.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

As another example, imagine an investigation into a machine that stopped because it overloaded and the fuse blew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taiichi Ohno|title=Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production|page=17|year=1988|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Productivity Press|ISBN=0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation shows that the machine overloaded because it had a bearing that wasn't being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the  automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump which was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows that it has a worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there isn't an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump, and damage it. The root cause of the problem is therefore that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events recurring. Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the lubrication pump will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. But there is a risk that the problem will simply recur, until the root cause is dealt with.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Note that "root causes" are likely to have many levels, and the analysis terminates at a level that is "root" only to the eyes of the current investigator.  Looking at the second example, a deeper level root cause is that the maintenance procedures at the plant included periodic inspection of the lubrication subsystem every two years, while the current lubrication subsystem vendor's product specified a 6-month period.  Switching vendors may have been due to management's desire to save money, and a failure to consult with cognizant engineering staff on the implication of the change, and so on.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Thus, while the "root cause" shown above may have prevented the quoted recurrence, it would not have prevented other{{snd}} perhaps more severe{{snd}} future failures.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Quite often, "engineering-type" root cause analysis stops at the engineering level, and fails to go down to deeper, organizational roots.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Root cause analysis is used in [[ITIL]], a set of detailed practices for [[IT service management]], where the analysis is performed to resolve a recurring incident by the problem manager. Within [[computer security incident management]], root cause analysis may be called security investigation and analysis.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Classification ==
Rather than one sharply defined methodology, RCA comprises many different tools, processes, and philosophies. However, several very-broadly defined approaches or "schools" can be identified by their basic approach or field of origin: safety-based, production-based, assembly-based, process-based, failure-based, and systems-based.

* Safety-based RCA arose from the fields of [[Accident Analysis|accident analysis]] and [[occupational safety and health]].
* Production-based RCA has roots in the field of [[quality control]] for industrial [[manufacturing]].
* Process-based RCA, a follow-on to production-based RCA, broadens the scope of RCA to include [[business process]]es.
* Failure-based RCA originates in the practice of [[failure analysis]] as employed in [[engineering]] and [[Maintenance, Repair and Operations|maintenance]].
* Systems-based RCA has emerged as an amalgam of the preceding schools, incorporating elements from other fields such as [[change management]], [[risk management]] and [[systems analysis]].

Despite the different approaches among the various schools of root cause analysis, all share some common principles. Several general processes for performing RCA can also be defined.

==General principles==
# The primary aim of root cause analysis is: to identify the factors that resulted in the nature, the magnitude, the location, and the timing of the harmful outcomes (consequences) of one or more past events; to determine what behaviors, actions, inactions, or conditions need to be changed; to prevent recurrence of similar harmful outcomes; and to identify lessons that may promote the achievement of better consequences. ("Success" is defined as the near-certain prevention of recurrence).
# To be effective, root cause analysis must be performed systematically, usually as part of an investigation, with conclusions and root causes that are identified backed up by documented evidence. A team effort is typically required.
# There may be more than one root cause for an event or a problem, therefore the difficult part is demonstrating the persistence and sustaining the effort required to determine them.
# The purpose of identifying all solutions to a problem is to prevent recurrence at lowest cost in the simplest way. If there are alternatives that are equally effective, then the simplest or lowest cost approach is preferred.
# The root causes identified will depend on the way in which the problem or event is defined. Effective problem statements and event descriptions (as failures, for example) are helpful and usually required to ensure the execution of appropriate analyses.
# One logical way to trace down root causes is by utilizing [[hierarchical clustering]] [[data mining|data-mining]] solutions (such as [[graph theory|graph-theory-based]] data mining). A root cause is defined in that context as "the conditions that enable one or more causes". Root causes can be deductively sorted out from upper groups of which the groups include a specific cause.
# To be effective, the analysis should establish a [[sequence of events]] or [[timeline]] for understanding the relationships between contributory (causal) factors, root cause(s) and the defined problem or event to be prevented.
# Root cause analysis can help transform a reactive culture (one that reacts to problems) into a forward-looking culture (one that solves problems before they occur or escalate). More importantly, RCA reduces the frequency of problems occurring over time within the environment where the process is used.
# Root cause analysis as a force for change is a threat to many cultures and environments. Threats to cultures are often met with resistance. Other forms of management support may be required to achieve effectiveness and success with root cause analysis. For example, a "non-punitive" policy toward problem identifiers may be required.

==General process for performing and documenting an RCA-based corrective action==
RCA (in steps 3, 4 and 5) forms the most critical part of successful corrective action, directing the corrective action at the true root cause of the problem. Knowing the root cause is secondary to the goal of prevention, as it is not possible to determine an absolutely effective corrective action for the defined problem without knowing the root cause.

# Define the problem or describe the event to prevent in the future. Include the qualitative and quantitative attributes (properties) of the undesirable outcomes. Usually this includes specifying the natures, the magnitudes, the locations, and the timing of events. In some cases, "lowering the risks of reoccurrences" may be a reasonable target. For example, "lowering the risks" of future automobile accidents is certainly a more economically attainable goal than "preventing all" future automobile accidents.
# Gather data and evidence, classifying it along a timeline of events to the final failure or crisis. For every behavior, condition, action and inaction, specify in the "timeline" what should have been done when it differs from what was done.
# In data mining Hierarchical Clustering models, use the clustering groups instead of classifying: (a) peak the groups that exhibit the specific cause; (b) find their upper-groups; (c) find group characteristics that are consistent; (d) check with experts and validate.
# Ask "why" and identify the causes associated with each sequential step towards the defined problem or event. "Why" is taken to mean "What were the factors that directly resulted in the effect?"
# Classify causes into two categories: causal factors that relate to an event in the sequence; and root causes that interrupted that step of the sequence chain when eliminated.
# Identify all other harmful factors that have equal or better claim to be called "root causes". If there are multiple root causes, which is often the case, reveal those clearly for later optimum selection.
# Identify corrective action(s) that will, with certainty, prevent recurrence of each harmful effect and related outcomes or factors. Check that each corrective action would, if pre-implemented before the event, have reduced or prevented specific harmful effects.
# Identify solutions that, when effective and with consensus agreement of the group: prevent recurrence with reasonable certainty; are within the institution's control; meet its goals and objectives; and do not cause or introduce other new, unforeseen problems.
# Implement the recommended root cause correction(s).
# Ensure effectiveness by observing the implemented solutions in operation.
# Identify other possibly useful methodologies for problem solving and problem avoidance.
# Identify and address the other instances of each harmful outcome and harmful factor.

==New York art world==
Pivar earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] in chemistry at [[Hofstra University]]. An inventor, he made a large fortune in plastics, founding Chem-Tainer industries in 1959. The business specialised in bulk-storage [[plastic container]]s. While remaining active in the [[plastics industry]], he became an independently wealthy investor and buyer on the art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alexander, ''Death and disaster: the rise of the Warhol empire and the race for Andy's millions'', Villard Books, 1994, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Pivar soon met [[Andy Warhol]], becoming one of his closest longtime friends. With Warhol he would go on regular shopping trips to buy "masterpieces", which could be objects bought anywhere, from a high-end auction house to a fleamarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

We used to go shopping together for it for a few hours practically every day in the past couple of years."&lt;ref&gt;Russell W. Belk, ''Collecting in a consumer society'', Psychology Press, 1995, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Pivar was a collector of 19th-century [[academic art]] at a time when it was unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;''Art &amp; antiques'', Volume 22, 1999, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; A scholar of the work of the sculptor [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], he wrote "The Barye Bronzes: A Catalogue Raisonne" in 1974, a collation of critical commentary on all the sculptor's known works.&lt;ref&gt;

Pivar wished to reintroduce traditional skills to the teaching of art, including human and animal anatomy. With Warhol, he helped to found the [[New York Academy of Art]] in 1979, becoming one of its board members. The academy opposed [[abstract art]] and promoted traditional skills. According to [[Eliot Goldfinger]], Pivar "strongly supported the acquisition of an anatomical collection of comparative skeletons, related artwork, anatomical models and charts, and the use of dissection as part of the curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Goldfinger, ''Animal anatomy for artists: the elements of form'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He donated over $1.2 million to the Academy during his involvement with it.&lt;ref name = "conn"/&gt;

He resigned from the Academy in 1994, complaining that he had been "lied to and outmaneuvered" by other senior figures at the institution. A report placed most of the blame on his "disruptive, angry and abusive" behavior for problems at the institution.&lt;ref name = "conn"&gt;

==Biological theories==
Beginning with his book ''Lifecode'' in 2004 Pivar has published novel claims about the evolution of species. He asserts that the body form of [[species]] are encoded not in [[DNA]] but in the patterned structure of a primordial [[germ plasm]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Origin of Form: Evolution by Self-Organization, Stuart Pivar, North Atlantic Books, 2009 {{ISBN|1-55643-886-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macmenamin&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:CU2gyUDK2twJ:www.ilasol.org.il/ILASOL/uploads/files/ILASOLintroductionV6.pdf+stuart+pivar+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgA0o56t0DdMsclymOItS6OIWzPV56kTS3wQLD-PR3oVeFoSq65ffq6ao3hpRCK2uIO_Xa2GIXgXb5FRAQtfEmXVnsEKZbjvoN4FK6Toiybb6Y2855TZQhmxR0tCF84NG0A9cFc&amp;sig=AHIEtbRqUvyz5yqYuyyf9A9wINXZDT3ynQ ILAOL introduction by Mark Macmenamin]&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics have stated that Pivar's proposed developmental sequences bear no resemblance to anything actually observed during embryological development.&lt;ref name=Macmenamin /&gt; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] says that Pivar's ideas constitute [[pseudoscience]].

A '''torture murder''' is a murder where death was preceded by the [[torture]] of the victim. In many legal jurisdictions, a murder involving "exceptional brutality or cruelty" will attract a harsher sentence.

==Frequency==

Notable individual incidents and successfully prosecuted cases are listed below but torture murder is much more common than this list may suggest. [[Lynching in the United States]]—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by [[human trophy collecting]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan |date=September 27, 2016 |title= U.S. owes black people reparations for a history of ‘racial terrorism,’ says U.N. panel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/27/u-s-owes-black-people-reparations-for-a-history-of-racial-terrorism-says-u-n-panel/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date=May 1, 2017|quote="Lynching was a form of racial terrorism that has contributed to a legacy of racial inequality that the United States must address.

Many were carnival-like events, with vendors selling food, printers producing postcards featuring photographs of the lynching and corpse, and the victim’s body parts collected as souvenirs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, since industrial acid became available in quantity during the 19th century, [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]] have become a globally widespread method of murder.

In the 21st century, many of the [[Killing of captives by ISIL|murders]] of foreigners in and citizens of [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] committed by members of the terrorist organization [[Daesh]] were preceded by torture.  Film footage of the [[persecution of Muslims in Myanmar]] documents the aftermath and testimony of torture murder by government forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Myanmar's Killing Fields |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/ |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[PBS]] |date=2018-05-08 |season=36 |transcript=transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/transcript/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence has demonstrated torture murder associated with many other [[massacre]]s, [[war crime]]s, and [[genocide]]s, both contemporary and historical.

==Punishment==

[[Murder#Country-specific_murder_law|Murder laws worldwide]] vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions. In the laws of [[Murder (Italian law)|Italy]], [[Murder in German law|Germany]], [[Murder (Norwegian law)|Norway]], and many parts of the [[Murder (United States law)|United States]], there are two or more "degrees" of murder, with wording such as: "''...inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim's death''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAW|Penal Law § 235.20 PEN Part 3 Title H]&lt;/ref&gt; typically used to rule that the highest degree should apply. In other jurisdictions, it may be that even if there was just one crime of murder, the sentencing practices and guidelines are such that the [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstance]] of any torture will nevertheless allow for a harsher than normal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentencing - Mandatory life sentences in Murder cases|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_-_mandatory_life_sentences_in_murder_cases/#an08|website=CPS|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the offence involved gratuitous cruelty|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/section_21a.html|website=Sentencing Bench Book|publisher=Judicial Commission of New South Wales|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''turnpike model of money'''  explains valued money as a way to facilitate trade between agents who meet as strangers in spatially separated isolated markets with no communication or transactions between the markets at any time.

In the standard [[Frictionless market|frictionless]] [[Arrow-Debreu model]], since the nonmonetary competitive equilibria are already [[Pareto optimal]], money can't facilitate exchange or is at best useless. A common approach in [[monetary economics]] is to either require that agents hold money for institutional reasons (for example, to pay taxes, or because the government forces individuals to accept it), to enter money holdings directly into individual's utility functions (the so-called "money in utility" or [[Miguel Sidrauski|Sidrauski model]]), or to impose an arbitrary [[Cash-in-advance constraint]] (the so-called [[Robert Clower|Clower constraint]]). However all of these approaches are somewhat ad hoc and do not explain why intrinsically worthless money can have value as medium of exchange. The turnpike model of money is one of the possible resolutions of this theoretical problem.&lt;ref name=freshwater&gt;Townsend R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">An '''unobservable''' (also called '''impalpable''') is an [[entity]] whose existence, nature, properties, qualities or relations are not directly [[perception|observable]] by humans. In [[philosophy of science]], typical examples of "unobservables" are [[atom|atomic particles]], the [[gravity|force of gravity]], [[causality|causation]] and [[belief]]s or [[Motivation|desires]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotodman.com/FodorPsychoSemanticsChap1.pdf] Fodor, Jerry Psychosemantics p. 7 &lt;/ref&gt;However, some philosophers ([[George Berkeley]] for example) also characterize all [[object (philosophy)|objects]]—trees, tables, other minds, microorganisms, every thing to which humans ascribe as the thing causing their perception—as unobservable.

"Unobservables" is a reference similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s distinction between [[noumenon|noumena]] (things-in-themselves, i.e., raw things in their necessarily unknowable state,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Radical Unknowability of Kant's 'Thing in Itself'", ''Cogito'' 3:2 (March 1985), pp.101-115; reprinted as Appendix V of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives] (University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; before they pass through the formalizing apparatus of the senses and the mind in order to become perceived objects) and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] (the perceived object). According to Kant, humans can never know noumena; all that humans know is the phenomena. Kant's distinction is similar to [[John Locke]]'s distinction between [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary/secondary_quality_distinction primary and secondary qualities].  Secondary qualities are what humans perceive such as redness, chirping, heat, mustiness or sweetness.  Primary qualities would be the actual qualities of the things themselves which give rise to the secondary qualities which humans perceive.

The [[ontology|ontological nature]] and [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues concerning unobservables is a central topic in philosophy of science.  The notion that a given unobservable exists is referred to as [[scientific realism]], in contrast to [[instrumentalism]], the notion that unobservables such as atoms are useful models but don't necessarily exist.

W. V. Metcalf distinguishes three kinds of unobservables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalf |first=W. V. |date=1940 |title=The Reality of the Unobservable |jstor=184849 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=337–341 |doi=10.1086/286640}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is the logically unobservable, which involves a contradiction. An example would be a length which is both longer and shorter than a given length. The second is the practically unobservable, that which we can conceive of as observable by the known sense-faculties of man but we are prevented from observing by practical difficulties. The third kind is the physically unobservable, that which can never be observed by any existing sense-faculties of man.

'''Vernacular orientation''' refers to the status that a language is afforded by one of its [[mother-tongue]] speakers (Tiessen, 2003).  This status is exhibited through the [[sociolinguistic]] behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker.  A speaker who exhibits positive [[vernacular]] orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, [[social network]]s and even levels of [[language proficiency]].  Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.

An example of research into vernacular orientation as expressed in a community can be found at [http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2003Tiessen.PDF].  This is a study on vernacular orientation in the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] community of the city of [[Sumgayit]] in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes.  Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made. This analysis of influential factors demonstrates the interaction between vernacular orientation as described in the typology and the contextual elements of the family, socio-economic dynamics and individual attitudes.

The '''''Vira Nirvana Samvat''''' (era) is a [[calendar era]] beginning on 15 October 527 BCE. It commemorates the [[nirvana]] of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]]. This is one of the oldest system of chronological reckoning which is still used in [[India]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=24}}

== History ==

The earliest text to mention 527 BCE as the year of [[Mahavira]]'s [[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]] is [[Yati-Vrishabha]]'s ''[[Tiloya-Pannatti]]'' (5th century CE).{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=84}} Subsequent works such as [[Jinasena]]'s ''[[Harivamsa Purana|Harivamśa]]'' (783 CE) mention the Vira Nirvana era, and give the difference between it and the [[Shaka era]] (beginning in 78 CE) as 605 years and 5 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. C. Sircar |title=Indian Epigraphy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXMB3649biQC&amp;pg=PA321 |year=1965 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-1166-9 |pages=321–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1974 the 2500th Nirvana Mahotsava was celebrated by the Jains throughout India.&lt;ref name="N. Upadhye, Review 1982 pp. 231-232"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mahavira and His Teachings|first=A.

==Usage==

The Jain year Vira Nirvana Samvat is obtained by adding 470 years to the Kartikadi Vikram samvat. For example, The Vira Nirvana Samvat 2544 started right after Diwali of October 20, 2017 on Vikram 2074, Kartika Krishna Amavasya (Chaitradi and Purnimanta).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinejainpathshala.com/images/jf/gallery/tithi_darpan_2018.jpg  Jain Tithi Darpan, Vir Nirvan Samvat 2044]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herenow4u.net/fileadmin/pics/ext/fb/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15591324_1219042171509416_2745373736079847221_o.jpg___aHR0cHM6Ly9zY29udGVudC54eC5mYmNkbi5uZXQvdi90MzEuMC04LzE1NTkxMzI0XzEyMTkwNDIxNzE1MDk0MTZfMjc0NTM3MzczNjA3OTg0NzIyMV9vLmpwZw==___.jpg  Shri Guru Pushkar Jain Devendra Calendar, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Chaitradiadi Vikram samvat (common in North India) starts seven months earier in Chaitra, thus during Chaitra-Kartika Krishna, the difference between Vikram and Vir Nivana samvat is 469 years.

The Jain business people traditionally started their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:&lt;ref&gt;Jain Sahitya aur Itihas par Vrihad Prakash, Jugalkishor Mukhtar, July 1956 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.

==Jain Calendar==
The Jain calendar ([[Panchangam|Panchāng]]) is a [[lunisolar calendar]], just like the traditional Vikarm or Saka calendars .  The months based on the position of the [[Moon]] with respect to the Earth and it is adjusted by adding an extra month (adhika masa) once every three years, to coincide with the [[Sun]] to bring month in phase with the season.  Its day or date which is known as Tithi, indicates the moon phase and the month indicates the approximate season of the [[solar year]].

The [[lunisolar calendar]] has the following arrangement:
A regular or normal year has 12 months; a leap year has 13 months.
A regular or normal year has 353, 354, or 355 days; a leap year has 383, 384, or 385 days.

The average number of days in a month is 30 but the average number of days in a Lunisolar year is 354 and not 360 (12 months in a year) because it takes the Moon about 29.5 days (not 30 days) to complete the circle around the Earth.  Hence one Tithi is eliminated in about duration of two months.
The [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] lunar, [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]], and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan]] calendars are all lunisolar, and so were the Japanese calendars until 1873 and the Chinese calendars until 1912.

The Islamic calendar is a pure Lunar Calendar because its date (Tithi) indicates the moon phase but its months are not in phase with the time of the solar year or the season.  It does not adjust its calendar to coincide with the sun or the season.  Hence no extra month is added every three years.

[[Gregorian calendar|The Gregorian calendar]] (English CE) is a pure [[Solar calendar|Solar Calendar]] and its date indicates the time of the solar season but not the moon phase.

'''''Who Speaks for the Negro?''''' is a 1965 book of interviews by [[Robert Penn Warren]] conducted with [[Civil Rights Movement]] activists.  The book was reissued by [[Yale University Press]] in 2014. The Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities at Vanderbilt University created the [https://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/ "''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' Digital Archive,"] featuring digitized versions of the original reel-to-reel recordings that Warren compiled for each of his interviewees as well as print materials related to the project, including the transcripts of those recordings, letters written between Warren and the interviewees, and contemporary reviews of the book.

==Interviews==

==Background==
In preparation for Random House's 1965 publication of his book ''Who Speaks for the Negro?'', Warren traveled throughout the United States in early 1964 and spoke with large numbers of men and women who were involved in the Civil Rights Movement. He interviewed nationally-known figures as well as people working in the trenches of the movement whose names might otherwise be lost to history. In each case, he recorded their conversations on a reel-to-reel tape recorder.

Often, Warren would begin by asking about the speakers' backgrounds, which often prompted them to talk about the inequalities that they had experienced that led to their participation in the Civil Rights Movement. Warren would also often ask the interviewees to respond to works from other writers, mainly [[W. E. B. Dubois]]'s ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', [[Kenneth Clark (psychologist)|Kenneth Clark]]'s essays about the detrimental effects of segregation on children, [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s ''The American Dilemma'', and [[James Baldwin]]'s ''[[Nobody Knows My Name]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xvii-xviii|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Warren would ask his interviewees their opinion on a number of key historical American figures, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], and [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xx|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Warren was able to interview an impressive number of people, there are very few women in the collection, as well as some notable figures missing from the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] ([[Ralph Abernathy]], [[James Bevel]], [[Dorothy Cotton]], and [[Fred Shuttlesworth]]), the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] ([[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], [[Diane Nash]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], and [[Julian Bond]]), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xx-xxi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The published volume contains sections of transcripts from the conversations as well as Warren’s reflections on the individuals he interviewed and his thoughts on the state of the Civil Rights Movement. In the foreword to the volume, Warren insists on the book being a record of his desire to find out more about the Civil Rights Movement rather than an unbiased or comprehensive volume. Warren states in the foreword, {{quote | This book is not a history, a sociological analysis, an anthropological study, or a ''Who's Who'' of the Negro Revolution. It is a record of my attempt to find out what I could find out. It is primarily a transcript of conversations, with settings and commentaries. That is, I want to make my reader see, hear, and feel as immediately as possible what I saw, heard, and felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Robert Penn|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an oral history of the Civil Rights Movement, ''Who Speaks'' may be compared to, among others, ''The New World of Negro Americans'' by [[Harold Isaacs]], ''My Soul is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered'' by [[Howell Raines]], and ''My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience'' by [[Juan Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Harold R.|title=The New World of Negro Americans|date=1964|publisher=Phoenix House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raines|first1=Howell|title=My Soul Is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered|date=1977|publisher=Putnam|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Juan|title=My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience|date=2004|publisher=AARP/Sterling|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' was reviewed widely by newspapers, cultural critics, and the general public. The tenor of the reviews varied greatly. Many news reviews—including those from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''—gave the book very positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolbier|title=Review|first1=Maurice|journal=New York Herald Tribune|date=May 28, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coughlin|first1=Francis|title=Review|journal=Chicago Tribune|date=June 4, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Atlantic Monthly|date=July 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Joseph|title=Review|journal=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=June 13, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Poore, in the ''New York Times,'' wrote that "a boon this book confers is to remind us that a main thrust in civilization can never cease to be toward decency and courtesy and justice for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poore|first1=Charles|title=Review|journal=New York Times|date=June 1, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Warren received hate-mail from writers accusing him of "Communist 'propaganda' [and] advocacy of 'racial mixing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Newsweek]]'' article called Warren "paternalistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Newsweek|date=June 7, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; More moderately, Albert Murray called ''Who Speaks'' the "very best inside report on the Negro Civil Rights Movement by anyone so far" while still acknowledging Warren's segregationist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though widely and for the most part positively reviewed, ''Who Speaks'' was not a commercial success, which disappointed Warren greatly. The book was out of print for decades until Yale University Press republished it in 2014 based largely on the traffic generated by the ''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' Digital Archive.

==Archive==

Much of the original material related to the book is still in existence, held at the University of Kentucky and Yale University Libraries. [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History|The Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky digitized their portion of the archival collection and provides searchable and streaming access to the online interviews using OHMS ([[Oral History Metadata Synchronizer]]).

===In the Book===

Warren grouped his interviews partly by geography and partly by theme. Each of the chapters consists of both narrativized and transcripted interviews and Warren's descriptions of setting, as well as deeper reflections inspired by the intervewees.

'''Zermelo set theory''' (sometimes denoted by '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''-'''&lt;/sup&gt;), as set out in an important paper in 1908 by [[Ernst Zermelo]], is the ancestor of modern [[set theory]].  It bears certain differences from its descendants, which are not always understood, and are frequently misquoted.  This article sets out the original axioms, with the original text (translated into English) and original numbering.

== The axioms of Zermelo set theory ==

Zermelo's axioms are stated for a model some (but not necessarily all) of whose objects are called sets, and the remaining objects are [[urelements]] and do not contain any elements. Zermelo's  language implicitly includes a membership relation ∈, an equality relation = (if it is not included in the underlying logic), and a unary predicate saying whether an object is a set. Later versions of set theory often assume that all objects are sets so there are no urelements and there is no need for the unary predicate.

: AXIOM I. [[Axiom of extensionality]] (''Axiom der Bestimmtheit'') "If every element of a set ''M'' is also an element of ''N'' and vice versa ... then ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; ''N''.  Briefly, every set is determined by its elements."
: AXIOM II. Axiom of elementary sets (''Axiom der Elementarmengen'') "There exists a set, the null set, ∅, that contains no element at all. If ''a'' is any object of the domain, there exists a set {''a''} containing ''a'' and only ''a'' as an element.  If ''a'' and ''b'' are any two objects of the domain, there always exists a set {''a'', ''b''} containing as elements ''a'' and ''b'' but no object ''x'' distinct from them both."  See [[Axiom of pairing|Axiom of pairs]].
: AXIOM III. [[Axiom of separation]] (''Axiom der Aussonderung'') "Whenever the [[propositional function]] &amp;ndash;(''x'') is definite for all elements of a set ''M'', ''M'' possesses a subset ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' containing as elements precisely those elements ''x'' of ''M'' for which &amp;ndash;(''x'') is true."
: AXIOM IV.  [[Axiom of power set|Axiom of the power set]] (''Axiom der Potenzmenge'') "To every set ''T'' there corresponds a set ''T'&amp;nbsp;'', the [[power set]] of ''T'', that contains as elements precisely all subsets of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM V. [[Axiom of union|Axiom of the union]] (''Axiom der Vereinigung'') "To every set ''T'' there corresponds a set ''∪T'', the union of ''T'', that contains as elements precisely all elements of the elements of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM VI. [[Axiom of choice]] (''Axiom der Auswahl'') "If ''T'' is a set whose elements all are sets that are different from ∅ and mutually disjoint, its union ''∪T'' includes at least one subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; having one and only one element in common with each element of ''T''&amp;nbsp;."
: AXIOM VII.  [[Axiom of infinity]] (''Axiom des Unendlichen'') "There exists in the domain at least one set ''Z'' that contains the null set as an element and is so constituted that to each of its elements ''a'' there corresponds a further element of the form {''a''}, in other words, that with each of its elements ''a'' it also contains the corresponding set {''a''} as element."

== Connection with standard set theory ==

The most widely used and accepted set theory is known as ZFC, which consists of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the addition of the [[axiom of choice]].  The links show where the axioms of Zermelo's theory correspond.  There is no exact match for "elementary sets".  (It was later shown that the singleton set could be derived from what is now called "Axiom of pairs".  If ''a'' exists, ''a'' and ''a'' exist, thus {''a'',''a''} exists.  By extensionality {''a'',''a''} = {''a''}.)  The empty set axiom is already assumed by axiom of infinity, and is now included as part of it.

Zermelo set theory does not include the axioms of [[axiom of replacement|replacement]] and [[axiom of regularity|regularity]]. The axiom of replacement was first published in 1922 by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]], who had independently discovered that Zermelo's axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...} where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[power set]] of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. They both realized that the axiom of replacement is needed to prove this. The following year, [[John von Neumann]] pointed out that this axiom is necessary to build [[von Neumann ordinal|his theory of ordinals]]. The axiom of regularity was stated by von Neumann in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreirós 2007, pp. 369, 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern ZFC system, the "propositional function" referred to in the axiom of separation is interpreted as "any property definable by a first order formula with parameters", so the separation axiom is replaced by an axiom scheme.   The notion of "first order formula" was not known in 1904 when Zermelo published his axiom system, and he later rejected this interpretation as being too restrictive. Zermelo set theory is usually taken to be a first-order theory with the separation axiom replaced by an axiom scheme with an axiom for each first-order formula. It can also be considered as a theory in [[second-order logic]], where now the separation axiom is just a single axiom. The second-order interpretation of Zermelo set theory is probably closer to Zermelo's own conception of it, and is stronger than the first-order interpretation.

In the usual [[Von Neumann universe|cumulative hierarchy]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of ZFC set theory (for ordinals α), any one of the sets
''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; for α a limit ordinal larger than the first infinite ordinal ω (such as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&amp;middot;2&lt;/sub&gt;) forms a model of Zermelo set theory. So the consistency of Zermelo set theory is a theorem of ZFC set theory. Zermelo's axioms do not imply the existence of &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; or larger infinite cardinals, as the model ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&amp;middot;2&lt;/sub&gt;  does not contain such cardinals. (Cardinals have to be defined differently in Zermelo set theory, as the usual definition of cardinals and ordinals does not work very well: with the usual definition it is not even possible to prove the existence of the ordinal &amp;omega;2.)

The [[axiom of infinity]] is usually now modified to assert the existence of the first infinite
von Neumann [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;;  the original Zermelo
axioms cannot prove the existence of this set, nor can the modified Zermelo axioms prove Zermelo's
axiom of infinity.  Zermelo's axioms (original or modified) cannot prove the existence of &lt;math&gt;V_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; as a set nor of any rank of the cumulative hierarchy of sets with infinite index.

Zermelo allowed for the existence of [[urelements]] that are not sets and contain no elements; these are now usually omitted from set theories.

==Mac Lane set theory==

Mac Lane set theory, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Mac Lane|year=1986|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane}}, is Zermelo set theory with the axiom of separation restricted to first-order formulas in which every quantifier is bounded,
Mac Lane set theory is similar in strength to [[topos theory]] with a [[natural number object]], or to the system in [[Principia mathematica]]. It is strong enough to carry out almost all ordinary mathematics not directly connected with set theory or logic.

== The aim of Zermelo's paper ==
The introduction states that the very existence of the discipline of set theory "seems to be threatened by certain contradictions or "antinomies", that can be derived from its principles &amp;ndash; principles necessarily governing  our thinking, it seems &amp;ndash; and to which no entirely satisfactory solution has yet been found".  Zermelo is of course referring to the "[[Russell's paradox|Russell antinomy]]".

He says he wants to show how the original theory of [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] can be reduced to a few definitions and seven principles or axioms.  He says he has ''not'' been able to prove that the axioms are consistent.

A non-constructivist argument for their consistency goes as follows. Define ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; for &amp;alpha; one of the [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] 0, 1, 2, ...,&amp;omega;, &amp;omega;+1, &amp;omega;+2,..., &amp;omega;·2 as follows:
* V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the empty set.
* For &amp;alpha; a successor of the form &amp;beta;+1, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the collection of all subsets of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt;.
* For &amp;alpha; a limit (e.g. &amp;omega;, &amp;omega;·2) then ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the union of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt; for &amp;beta;&lt;&amp;alpha;.
Then the axioms of Zermelo set theory are consistent because they are true in the model ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;·2&lt;/sub&gt;. While a non-constructivist might regard this as a valid argument, a constructivist would probably not: while there are no problems with the construction of the sets up to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;, the construction of  ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;+1&lt;/sub&gt; is less clear because one cannot constructively define every subset of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;. This argument can be turned into a valid proof in Zermelo–Frenkel set theory, but this does not really help because the consistency of Zermelo–Frenkel set theory is less clear than the consistency of Zermelo set theory.

== The axiom of separation ==
Zermelo comments that Axiom III of his system is the one responsible for eliminating the antinomies.  It differs from the original definition by Cantor, as follows.

Sets cannot be independently defined by any arbitrary logically definable notion.  They must be constructed in some way from previously constructed sets. For example, they can be constructed by taking powersets, or they can be ''separated'' as subsets of sets already "given".  This, he says, eliminates contradictory ideas like "the set of all sets" or "the set of all ordinal numbers".

He disposes of the [[Russell paradox]] by means of this Theorem:  "Every set &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; possesses at least one subset &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; that is not an element of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; ".  Let &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; be the subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for which, by AXIOM III, is separated out by the notion "&lt;math&gt;x \notin x&lt;/math&gt;".  Then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; cannot be in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  For

# If &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; contains an element ''x'' for which ''x'' is in ''x'' (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; itself), which would contradict the definition of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''M'', then &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''M'' that satisfies the definition "&lt;math&gt;x \notin x&lt;/math&gt;", and so is in &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is wrong, proving the theorem.  Hence not all objects of the universal domain ''B'' can be elements of one and the same set.  "This disposes of the Russell [[antinomy]] as far as we are concerned".

This left the problem of "the domain ''B''" which seems to refer to something.  This led to the idea of a [[proper class]].

== Cantor's theorem ==
Zermelo's paper is notable for what may be the first mention of [[Cantor's theorem]] explicitly and by name.  This appeals strictly to set theoretical notions, and is thus not exactly the same as Cantor's [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]].

Cantor's theorem: "If ''M'' is an arbitrary set, then always ''M'' &lt; P(''M'') [the power set of ''M''].  Every set is of lower cardinality than the set of its subsets".

Zermelo proves this by considering a function φ: ''M'' → P(''M'').  By Axiom III this defines the following set ''M'&amp;nbsp;'':

:''M'&amp;nbsp;''  =  {''m'':  ''m'' ∉ φ(''m'')}.

But no element ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' of ''M&amp;nbsp;'' could correspond to ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', i.e. such that φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') = ''M'&amp;nbsp;''.  Otherwise we can construct a contradiction:

:1) If ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' then by definition ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' ∉ φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') = ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', which is the first part of the contradiction

:2) If ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is not in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' but in ''M&amp;nbsp;'' then by definition ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' ∉ ''M'&amp;nbsp;'' = φ(''m'&amp;nbsp;'') which by definition implies that ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' is in ''M'&amp;nbsp;'', which is the second part of the contradiction.

so by contradiction ''m'&amp;nbsp;'' does not exist. Note the close resemblance of this proof to the way Zermelo disposes of Russell's paradox.
