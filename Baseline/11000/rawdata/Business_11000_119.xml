Abdoulaye's companies have created employment and business opportunities for more than 800 people in [[Zambia]] and [[Senegal]], this in turn contributes significantly towards government revenue, in terms of various taxes.&lt;ref name="EITI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jo.gouv.sn/spip.php?article8941 Ministere de l’economie et des finances  - Arrete ministeriel n° 228 mef-dgid-dedt en date du 5 janvier 2011] ''Journal officiel de Senegal'' Retrieval date 5 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Aziz bin Fahd received a bachelor of arts degree in administrative sciences from [[King Saud University]].&lt;ref name=webpage&gt;{{cite web|title=Index |url=http://www.abdulazizbinfahad.com/en_index.html |publisher=Web page dedicated to Abdul Aziz bin Fahd |accessdate=23 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502233511/http://www.abdulazizbinfahad.com/en_index.html |archivedate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional experience==
Prince Abdul Aziz was first appointed as minister of state without portfolio in May 1998.&lt;ref name=sonline&gt;{{cite web|title=The Council of Ministers|url=http://www.saudia-online.com/Government%20Council%20of%20Ministers.htm|publisher=Saudia Online|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he was made head of the Office of the Council of Ministers in January 2000, when he was 28 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakr|first=Naomi|authorlink=Naomi Sakr|title=Whys and Wherefores of Satellite Channel Ownership|journal=Satellite Realms: Transnational Television, Globalization and the Middle East|year=2001|url=http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=13&amp;reading_id=1029&amp;sequence=3|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that after [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]'s death, he began to live in [[Switzerland]] and came to [[Saudi Arabia]] to participate in the meetings of the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prens Abdülaziz bin Fahd'ın çöküşü (The Fall of Abdulaziz bin Fahd) |url=http://www.diplomatikgozlem.com/TR/belge/1-7316/prens-abdulaziz-bin-fahdin-cokusu.html |publisher=Diplomatik Gözlem (Turkish, Diplomatic Observation) |accessdate=12 April 2012 |date=14 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615022826/http://www.diplomatikgozlem.com/TR/belge/1-7316/prens-abdulaziz-bin-fahdin-cokusu.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2011, he was relieved from his position as head of the court of Cabinet affairs by a royal decree.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Abdul Ghafour (26 June 2011):[http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article462235.ece "Cabinet court merged with royal court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630104155/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article462235.ece |date=30 June 2011 }}. Arab News.&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared that he resigned from his posts of minister of State and member of the Council of Ministers at his own request in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fahd bin Abdul Aziz’s exemption from the Presidency of the Prime Ministry Cabinet Office|url=http://www.islamtimes.org/vdcg3y97.ak9t74j5ra.html|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=Islam Times|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
His ties with [[Saudi Oger]] were well known in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The company was founded by [[Rafik Hariri]], who built Saudi Oger into a large company with the assistance of [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. Hariri said ‘The meat on my shoulder is from King Fahd,’ according to [[As'ad Abu Khalil]], a professor of political science at [[California State University Stanislaus]], who has written several books and runs the blog [[The Angry Arab News Service]]. Hariri, also a former prime minister of [[Lebanon]], was assassinated in 2005. His son, [[Saad Hariri]], took over Saudi Oger and became Lebanon’s prime minister for 14 months before he was ousted in 2011. Saad Hariri and Prince Abdul Aziz are known to be close.&lt;ref name=russ&gt;{{cite news|last=Buettner|first=Russ|title=At a Rape Trial, Two Views of a Prince’s Wealth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/nyregion/at-rape-trial-2-views-of-a-saudi-princes-wealth.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Aziz bin Fahd  owned fifty percent of the [[MBC Group|MBC]], of which the remainder is owned by his maternal uncle [[Waleed bin Ibrahim al Ibrahim]]. It is reported that Prince Abdul Aziz dealt with both the profits and the ideology of MBC Channels, including [[al Arabiya]].&lt;ref name=wikileaks09&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideological and Ownership Trends in the Saudi Media|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|publisher=Cablegate|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=11 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116083750/http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|archive-date=16 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged in a [[New York Supreme Court]] affidavit that he was the secret owner of a $1 billion property portfolio in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Foley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-saudi-royals-secret-1bn-us-empire-7817936.html|title=Revealed: Saudi royals' secret $1bn US empire|publisher=The Independent|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which owns the American headquarters of the oil giant [[BP]] and the defence contractor [[BAe Systems]]. In January 2002 The Daily Telegraph newspaper valued the portfolio at £4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8272597/Former-Credit-Suisse-executive-Pierre-Rolin-owes-43m.html |title=Former Credit Suisse executive Pierre Rolin 'owes £43m'|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affidavit, which was subsequently partially sealed by the judge but had already become available on internet blogs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96621795/Secret-1B-Saudi-Property-Empire|title=Secret $1B Saudi Property Empire|publisher=Scribd|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sethhettena.com/2012/documents-reveal-secret-1b-saudi-property-empire/ |title=Docs Reveal Secret $1B Saudi Property Empire"Seth Hettena |publisher=Seth Hettena |date=10 June 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815081659/http://www.sethhettena.com/2012/documents-reveal-secret-1b-saudi-property-empire/ |archivedate=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the properties were being managed by a group which included Sheikh Majid Al Ibrahim, Prince’s maternal uncle, and that total control of the portfolio was ultimately seized by Interventure Capital Group and Interventure Advisers, both of [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. According to a press release issued by Hyatt Hotels Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.hyatt.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=228969&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1656251&amp;highlight=|title=Hyatt Hotels Corporation|publisher=Investors|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventure Capital Group is run by Jaber Al Ibrahim and is an adviser to Naseel Holding Company, the Al Ibrahim family investment vehicle chaired by Sheikh Majid Al Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naseel.com/message.asp|title=Chairman Message|publisher=Naseel|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in October 2010, Interventure Capital Group is also behind another major portfolio of properties which had been controlled by a UK-based company, StratREAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8057153/Tory-donor-Pierre-Rolin-accused-of-stealing-30m-from-Gulf-investor.html|title=Tory donor Pierre Rolin accused of stealing £30m from Gulf investor |publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assets purchased by StratREAL on behalf of Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd included Fifth Street Towers, a Minneapolis office complex, for $294 million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StratREAL|url=http://www.bensoncairns.com/stratreal/images/5_news/pr2007/Minnesota.pdf|publisher=Srtrategic Real Estate Advisors|accessdate=24 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122035626/http://www.bensoncairns.com/stratreal/images/5_news/pr2007/Minnesota.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, following a foreclosure on the complex for mortgage default, Fifth Street Towers was sold at a sheriff's auction for $1 over the outstanding debt of $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Webber|first=Maura |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577390702752284054|title=Venture Pays $1 Over Debt To Win Minneapolis Tower|work=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mansion at 5 Palace Green, on London's [[Kensington Palace Gardens]] (nicknamed "Billionaires' Row"), was reported to be being offered for sale by Abdul Aziz in July 2013 for £100 million.&lt;ref name='Hipwell 2013'&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/property/article3827926.ece Billionaire Saudi’s £100m London home up for sale], ''[[The Times]]'', 29 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliances==
Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was previously one of [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]]'s closest aides. However, later, he seemed to have had a falling out with the monarch and to have been close to his uncle, the late [[Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Crown Prince Nayef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapoor|first=Talal|title=Nayif's Return – A Lame Duck Crown Prince?|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=79251&amp;pageNum=2|publisher=Datarabia|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fortune==
Abdul Aziz received exactly half of all profits of the successful Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC).&lt;ref name=wikileaks09/&gt; He had a number of palaces in Saudi Arabia and around various other parts of the world which have cost over $2 billion&lt;ref&gt;[http://syrianthinkers.org/countries/saudi/articles/TheSaudiTrap.pdf The Saudi Trap]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728080139/http://syrianthinkers.org/countries/saudi/articles/TheSaudiTrap.pdf |date=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

* A very large private stately residential complex with the replica of [[Alhambra]] and several other famous forts set within well maintained splendid gardens covering an area of 134 acres in the exclusive area overlooking Wadi Hanifa in Riyadh. {{Coord|24.645808|N|46.643202|E}}

* In [[Jeddah]] he has several palaces with private yacht berths and each palace has more than twenty guest houses .{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is the largest in its field in Iceland and the 9th largest in the [[Nordic countries]]. Advania has corporate clients in the public and private sector. It provides a wide range of IT-services, platforms, cloud [[solution]]s and support to multinational enterprises, governments, big, small and medium-sized businesses.

==History==
Advania traces its roots to three Nordic countries, [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. Over a long period of time each country generated a component of what eventually was braided into one company, Advania AB, in 2012.

=== The first branch was EJS ===
In 1939 the Icelandic entrepreneur Einar J. Skúlason founded '''EJS''', an office equipment repair workshop in Reykjavik. He soon expanded his business, opened a store and started importing office machinery, cash registers etc.  During [[World War II]] the company also repaired guns and [[lighter]]s. EJS eventually became a dominant IT business in Iceland. In 1952 the [[Icelandic Government|Icelandic government]] and the city of [[Reykjavík|Reykjavik]] founded '''Skýrr''', an IT company whose purpose was to take a leading role in computing and recordkeeping in Iceland. The company was privatized in 1995 and later became the core element in a group of companies – including EJS – that merged under the Skýrr brand.

=== The Swedish branch was next to evolve ===
In 1971 the IT company Nokia Elektronic AB – later renamed Datapoint Svenska AB – was founded in Sweden. The company sold [[Datapoint]] computer terminals but later became a network pioneer and a key system integrator in Sweden. In 2003 Datapoint merged with Virtus AB, an IT-company which was founded in 1994 and grew rapidly. Virtus soon became a key player in the Swedish market, focusing on [[Microsoft]] based solutions and offering storage &amp; backup services. In 2003 one the strongest and most comprehensive system integrators in Sweden was created when Datapoint and Virtus merged. The new company was named Kerfi AB.

=== And the Norwegian was third ===
In 1991 Merkantildata Applikasjon was founded in Norway, originally as a business unit within Merkantildata (later ATEA). The company focused on implementing ERP solutions in the Nordic market, industry solutions for retail, property management, logistics, legal and transport &amp; waste management. In 2000 the company changed its name to Hands and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In 2005 Hands was unlisted, as it was acquired by the Icelandic company Kögun which later merged with Skýrr (see above). Despite changes in ownership Hands kept its Norwegian identity and acquired Nett.2.3 and Completo in 2005.

In 2012 Advania AB was born, when Skýrr from Iceland, Kerfi from Sweden and Hands from Norway merged and became a key challenger in the Scandinavian IT-market.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Since then four companies have been acquired and merged with Advania, the listed Swedish IT company Caperio included.

== Business Areas ==

'''Alona Barkat''' ({{lang-he-n|אלונה ברקת}}; born 24 June 1969) is an Israeli [[Businessperson|businesswoman]], and owner of the [[Association football|football]] team [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Beer Sheva]].

==Biography==
Barkat was born and raised in [[Ashkelon]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/A-victory-for-social-change-457475 A victory for social change - ''The Jerusalem Post''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14 she moved to [[Jerusalem]] to {{what|study [[atelier]]|date=January 2018}}. Four years later she returned to national service in her hometown. She then studied at [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/hapoel-beersheva-becomes-israel-s-leicester-city-1.57639 "Hapoel Beersheva becomes Israel's Leicester City"]&lt;/ref&gt; performing undergraduate and graduate studies in the history of the [[Middle East]]. During her studies she met Eli Barkat,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; then a student in Mathematics and Computer Science, and the two married.

In 1996 she moved to [[Silicon Valley]] in the United States with her husband, who became a businessman with his brother [[Nir Barkat]]. He was an early investor in [[Check Point]] and set up the [[venture capital]] fund BRM and IVN. In the eight years in which the family lived in the United States, Barkat started in the field of philanthropy. Among other things, the fund management company IVN also funded social projects, and has been active in organizations such as [[AIPAC]] and the [[Jewish Federation]] of [[San Francisco]].

In 2004, she moved back to Israel with her family. Relations with the businessman Lonnie Herzikovic, then-owner of the football team [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], led her to consider entering a partnership with Maccabi Tel Aviv. She was involved in establishing a research institute at the [[University of Tel Aviv]], together with the Rashi Foundation, where she met [[Eli Alaluf]], CEO of the Fund at the time. Alaluf convinced her to buy the football team [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Beer Sheva]], which played in the second division at the time.

In the summer of 2007, just weeks before the opening of the season, the acquisition of the group from the previous owner, Eli Zino, was completed. Barkat became the first woman in Israel to own a football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{cite web|title=Obstacles have been removed, Alona Barkat Hapoel Be'er Sheva acquired|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3421188,00.html|website=Ynet|accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barkat's management team put special emphasis on a youth department, educational activities, and community connection. In March 2010, the group announced their departure at the end of the season, after a number of fans of the group tried to attack the coach, [[Guy Azouri]]. Two months later, after seeing a dramatic improvement in fan behavior, she announced that she had changed her mind and that she intended to stay with the group.

In May 2016 the team won the [[2015–16 Israeli Premier League|Football League Championship]] in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{cite web|title=After 40 years: Hapoel Beer Sheva has won the state championship with a 1-3 for Bnei Sakhnin|url=http://sports.walla.co.il/item/2963216|website=WallaSport|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkat lives with her husband and three children in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.

{{Big Five Hawaii}}
'''Amfac, Inc.''', formerly known as '''American Factors''' and originally '''H. Hackfeld and Company''', was a [[land development]] company in Hawaii. Founded in 1849 as a retail and sugar business, it was considered one of the so-called [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]] companies in the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. At its peak it owned {{convert|60000|acre}} of land, and was a dominant sugar company in Hawaii as well the founder of one of its best known department stores, [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]]. 
It now&lt;!-- when? --&gt; owns {{convert|5000|acre}} of land in [[Kaanapali]] on the island of [[Maui]]. Since 2005 it is known as Kaanapali Land, LLC ({{OTC Pink|KANP}}).

==History==

German immigrant Heinrich Hackfeld and his brother-in-law J. C. Pflueger founded a dry goods store called H. Hackfeld and Company in 1849 in [[Honolulu]]. Hackfeld later&lt;!-- when??  --&gt; became the business agent for [[Old Sugar Mill of Koloa|Kōloa Plantation]] on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]]. [[Paul Isenberg]] (1837–1903) became a partner in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher=[[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg34bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Paul  |accessdate=August 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Pioneer Mill, DCCA #207, was seized by the U.S. government [[Alien Property Custodian]]. It was later sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to "American Factors". In 1966, the name was further shortened to "Amfac". 
Henry Alexander Walker became president in the 1930s. The family estate known as the [[H. Alexander Walker Residence]], was developed into a showcase garden.&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{cite web |title= H. Alexander Walker Residence nomination form |author=Dorothy Riconda |author2= Robert M.

From 1968 to 1972 under president Henry Alexander Walker Jr. Amfac acquired 42 different companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= July 31, 1972 |title= Corporations:Amfac's Wide Swing |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877962,00.html |work=TIME |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald L. Sloan was removed as president November 20, 1987 and replaced by Richard L. Griffith (Walker was still chairman of the board). The company announced it was selling its non-Hawaii business units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/business/amfac-is-planning-to-sell-its-non-hawaii-businesses.html |date= December 14, 1987 |title= Amfac Is Planning to Sell Its Non-Hawaii Businesses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 27, 2010 | first=Calvin | last=Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amfac was bought by [[Chicago]]-based [[JMB Realty]] in 1988 for US$920&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/19/business/company-news-amfac-holders-back-bid-by-jmb.html |date= November 11, 1988 |title= Company News: Amfac Holders Back Bid by JMB |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the sugar industry in Hawaii declined after statehood, so did the fortunes of Amfac.

[[File:Kolkata BBD Bagh2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Writers' Building from across [[Lal Dighi]] in B.B.D. Bagh]]
'''B.B.D. Bagh''', formerly called '''Dalhousie Square''', is the shortened version for Benoy-Badal-Dinesh Bagh. It is the seat of power of the state government, as well as the [[central business district]] in [[Kolkata]] in [[Kolkata district]] in the [[India]]n  [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]].

==Origin of name==
[[File:Memory_of_martyrdom.jpg|thumb|Memory of martyrdom]]
{{Benoy Badal Dinesh}}
B.B.D. stands for three young [[Indian independence freedom fighters]] — [[Benoy Basu|Benoy]], [[Badal Gupta|Badal]] and [[Dinesh Gupta|Dinesh]] — who on 8 December 1930 shot dead the Inspector General of Prisons, N.S. Simpson, in the balconies of the [[Writers' Building]] of the then Dalhousie Square. The square had been named after [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], [[Governor General of India]] from 1847 to 1856. At different times it has been called ‘The Green before the Fort’ or Tank Square.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, H.E.A., ''Calcutta Old and New'', 1909/1980, p 268-9, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=300px|quote=As we enter the town, very expansive square opens before us, with a large expanse of water in the middle, for public use… the square itself is composed of magnificent houses which render Calcutta not only the handsomest town in Asia but one of the finest in the world. One side of the square consists of a range of buildings occupied by persons in civil employments under the Company, such as writers in public offices.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi, ''Traders and Trades in Old Calcutta'', in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol I, pp. 156-160, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-563696-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source= [[Louis de Grandpré|L. de Grandpre]], ''A Voyage in the Indian Ocean and to Bengal'' (1803)}}

==Geography==
The B.B.D. Bagh area is near the [[Hooghly River]] in the western part of central [[Kolkata]] and is a square built around the old [[Lal Dighi]] tank. The old fort built by the British was near where the General Post Office now is. The area was in the heart of [[Kalikata]] or the White Town in old Calcutta.

==History==

[[File:Dalhousie 1870s.jpg|thumbnail|left|A picture of Dalhousie Square looking northeast in the 1870s ]]
[[File:General Post Office (GPO), Calcutta (c. 1880s).jpg|thumbnail|right|A view of the General Post Office in the 1880s]]
B.B.D. Bagh (or Dalhousie Square as it was formerly known) was created as the center of the [[British East India Company|British East India Company's]] trading post along the banks of the Hooghly River. Between the river and the tank (now known as [[Lal Dighi]]), lay the original Fort William. In the summer of 1756, [[Siraj ud-Daulah|Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah]] of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa launched an attack on the British town for the company's decision to strengthen the fortifications around it. The survivors of the attack were sent to a garrison within the fort which spurred an incident infamously known as the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. The British soon retook the city after the Nawab retreated from the forces of [[Robert Clive]]. Within a year, the British East India Company's forces had taken all of Bengal and Calcutta, along with the square, was established as the commercial and political center of [[British India]]. 

Over the next one and a half centuries, the square grew in importance and influence. It was named after [[Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India. After the fall of company rule in India, the Writers' Building became the secretariat of the Viceroy of India. A number of corporations and institutions opened offices and headquarters in and around the square, giving it its role as the central business district of the city. In 1912, the capital of British India was officially moved to [[New Delhi]], but the majority of the financial and political institutions in the area remained. 

During the first half of the 20th century, the [[Indian Independence Movement]] began to reach its peak and took a violent turn in Bengal. On the eighth of December 1930, three revolutionaries, Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh, stormed the building and fatally shot the Inspector General of Prisons, N.S. Simpson. The three committed suicide and the square was renamed B.B.D. Bagh in their honor after Indian independence. In 1947, the political establishments were officially handed over to the government of India and the government of the newly formed state of [[West Bengal]]. Over the next few decades, Calcutta (as it was known) would go through rapid economic decline, but B.B.D. Bagh would remain the heart of East India.

==Modern significance==

[[File:KolkataHSBC.JPG|thumbnail|right|Hong Kong House which has and still houses the offices of HSBC in Kolkata.]]
B.B.D. Bagh is still the commercial and political center of all of East India and many of the business and political institutions from the colonial era still exist. The centerpiece is the [[Writers' Building]] which is the secretariat of the Government of the State of West Bengal and houses the office of the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]]. To the west lie the [[General Post Office, Kolkata|General Post Office]], the Royal Insurance Building, the eastern office of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], the headquarters of the [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railway]], head office of the [[Kolkata Port Trust]], and a number of other government offices. The native name of the area is '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Office Para'''. To the north lie the Royal Exchange Building which houses the [[Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry]], the [[Calcutta Stock Exchange]], the [[Standard Chartered]] Building, and many financial establishments. The eastern end also houses a number of offices till [[Chittaranjan Avenue]]. The area south of the square is home to the [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Raj Bhavan]], which is now the residence of the governor and the former residence of the viceroy and governor-general of India. A number of former British colonial administrative offices, including the former foreign and military secretariats, the Treasury Office, the Telegraph Office, and the [[Kolkata Town Hall]] can be found here. This area is also a major commercial district with the offices of [[HSBC]] at Hong Kong House and the [[Great Eastern Hotel (Kolkata)|Great Eastern Hotel]].  

B.B.D. Bagh can still be considered as one of the best remnants and concentrated zones of British colonial architecture in the world. The square is also characterized by other historical landmarks including [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's Church]], which was one of the first buildings in Calcutta and is modeled on [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London's Trafalgar Square. The church is home to beautiful stained glass windows and paintings as well as the mausoleum of [[Job Charnock]], the man who founded modern Calcutta. B.B.D. Bagh also has a statue of famous philanthropist [[Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh]] of [[Raj Darbhanga|Darbhanga]] (1858–1898), sculpted by [[Edward Onslow Ford]].

Overall, the square sees thousands of people arriving from all over the [[Kolkata metropolitan area]] to the offices and businesses that have characterized the area for the last three centuries since the establishment of Calcutta.

==Preservation==

Dalhousie Square was included in the [[2004 World Monuments Watch|2004]] and [[2006 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]] due to "decades of neglect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/dalhousie-square World Monuments Fund - Dalhousie Square]&lt;/ref&gt; After this listing the international financial services company [[American Express]] provided funding through WMF for the square's preservation. A number of buildings in the area have also been listed as heritage buildings and have gone through extensive restorations to bring back the charm of the square. The centerpiece, the Writers' Building, has been temporarily vacated to give way for a massive restoration of the building, which has fallen into disrepair in many areas.

==Business career==
Steinmetz along with his brother Daniel founded what subsequently became known as Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR). Beny currently occupies an advisory role to the company's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="BSG Resources Limited"/&gt; 

In March 2014, the Swiss daily ''[[Le Temps]]'' reported that Beny Steinmetz had sold shares in the Steinmetz Diamond Group (SDG) to his brother Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/03/30/swiss-newspaper-reports-beny-steinmetz-sells-interest-in-diamond-business/ Swiss Newspaper Reports Beny Steinmetz Sells Interest In Diamond Business], ''[[Jewish Business News]]'', 30 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/guinea-strips-beny-steinmetz-bsg-resources-mining-contracts-corruption|title=Guinea to strip Beny Steinmetz company of mining concessions|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an investor of Gabriel Resources Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/steinmetz-unit-invests-in-gabriel-resources-2009-11-12|title=Steinmetz unit invests in Gabriel Resources|publisher=Mining Weekly|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koidu Holdings]], which formerly operated as a joint venture, has been wholly owned by the BSGR company since 2007.&lt;ref name="koiduholdings"&gt;[http://www.koiduholdings.com/company-history.php Koidu Holdings Company History] Retrieved 2012-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baxter"&gt;Joan Baxter, ''Dust from our eyes: an unblinkered look at Africa'', Wolsak and Wynn Publishers Ltd., 2008, p. 226 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I_kMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;dq=%22beny+steinmetz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UtEQTrLjNdSftwfalYn3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2008, a three-year exploration permit for [[Simandou]] Blocks 1 &amp; 2, in the [[Republic of Guinea]], was awarded to BSGR Guinea, after the government of Guits to mine the northern half of Simandou, days before he died, to Steinmetz for $160 million. Steinmetz then soon sold a 51% share on to [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]] for $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21603507-guineas-government-may-last-be-dealing-sensibly-its-mineral-riches-let|title=Guinea and its iron ore: Let the people benefit, for once|magazine=The Economist|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Justice Department]] and the [[FBI]]  investigated BSGR's acquisition of the rights to extract half of the iron ore deposits at [[Simandou|Simandou, Guinea]], due to concerns about corruption and bribery.&lt;ref name="nyer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/fbi-arrest-bribery-10bn-mountain FBI arrest agent over bribery cover up claim in battle over $10bn mountain], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-corruption-deal-of-the-century-how-guinea-lost-billions-of-pounds-in-simandou-mining-licensing-8662534.html "The corruption deal of the century: How Guinea lost billions of pounds in Simandou mining licensing], ''The Independent'', 17 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|HOfNE2gZH1o}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSGR denied these allegations and in an interview to the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', Steinmetz said: “We are the victims. We have done only good things for Guinea, and what we’re getting is spit in the face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/08/buried-secrets|title=Buried Secrets|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 the Guinean government accused BSGR of obtaining the Simandou mining rights by paying bribes to the wife of then-president [[Lansana Conté]] in 2008, and that the rights would be stripped from BSGR and its partner [[Vale (mining company)|Vale S.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinea to strip Beny Steinmetz company of mining concessions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/guinea-strips-beny-steinmetz-bsg-resources-mining-contracts-corruption|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014|author=Ian Cobain|author2=Juliette Garside|author3=Anne Penketh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2014 BSGR started an [[international arbitration]] proceeding against the Republic of Guinea in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]], challenging the government's decision to revoke its mining rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/guinea-mining-simandou-idUSL5N0RB45320140910|title=BSGR pushes ahead with arbitration against Guinea over Simandou mining rights|date=10 September  2014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] then filed suit against Steinmetz, BSGR and Vale alleging that they had devised a [[RICO]] scheme to steal "valuable mining rights" held by Rio Tinto.&lt;ref name="GUA1may"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cobain|first=Ian|title=Rio Tinto sues Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/01/rio-tinto-sues-beny-steinmetz|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Steinmetz subsequently hired former FBI director [[Louis Freeh]], defense attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]], and law firm [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom]], as part of his defense team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverstein|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Silverstein|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/02/louis-freehs-latest-investigation-billionaire-businessman-accused-bribing-african-government|title=Louis Freeh's Latest Investigation: Billionaire Businessman Accused of Bribing African Government|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=2 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102234158/https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/02/louis-freehs-latest-investigation-billionaire-businessman-accused-bribing-african-government|archivedate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Rio Tinto's RICO lawsuit against BSGR was dismissed, with U.S. District Judge [[Richard Berman]] ruling that Rio exceeded the [[statute of limitations]] when filing their claim against BSGR in 2014 and that the company failed to identify a pattern of racketeering activity by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authors=Erik Larson &amp; Bob Van Voris|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-20/steinmetz-bsg-resources-win-ruling-dismissing-rio-tinto-suit|title=Steinmetz, BSG Resources Win Dismissal of Rio Tinto Lawsuit|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November 2016, Alan Davies, head of the Rio Tinto department responsible for Simandou, was suspended due to an investigation into the lawfulness of Rio Tinto's payment to Francois de Combert, former managing partner at Lazard and personal adviser to the president of Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-11/billionaire-steinmetz-says-rio-probe-proves-guinea-mine-plot|title=Billionaire Says Rio Probe Proves Elaborate Plot to Strip Prized Guinea Mine Rights|date=11 November 2016|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 December 2016, ''[[France 24]]'' aired recordings from 2012 that it claimed were conversations between Francois de Combret and unnamed people involved in negotiations over the future of Simandou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20161201-exclusive-audio-recordings-guinea-president-conde-simandou-mine-bribery-rio-tinto|title=Audio recordings drag Guinea president into mine bribery scandal|date=1 December 2016|newspaper=France 24|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian media referred to the controversy as ''Guineagate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iron-ore/recordings-suggest-rio-tinto-consultant-hand-in-hand-with-guinea-20161202-gt2lbw|title=French claims Rio's consultant working 'hand in hand' with officials in Guinea|date=2 December 2016|newspaper=Financial Review||access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Steinmetz was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and bribery charges  following an investigation carried out by Israeli, American, Swiss, and Guinean authorities in coordination with the [[OECD]].&lt;ref name="Billionaire"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/billionaire-vs-billionaire-israels-steinmetz-sues-soros|title=Billionaire vs. billionaire: Israel's Steinmetz sues Soros|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was placed under [[house arrest]] on 19 December 2016, due to accusations that he paid tens of millions of dollars to senior public officials in Guinea to advance his businesses, specifically in connection with BSGR's purchase of Simandou.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"&gt;{{cite news|title=BSGR sues billionaire George Soros over loss of Guinea iron project|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bsgr-lawsuit-idUSKBN17G1LL|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmetz was released without charge the following month.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-corruption-steinmetz-idUSKBN14O1QT Billionaire Beny Steinmetz released from Israel house arrest], Reuters.com, 4 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2017, BSGR filed a suit against American billionaire [[George Soros]] in U.S. federal court in New York, claiming he had engaged in a lengthy effort to defame the company and sabotage its business in Simandou and around the world.&lt;ref name="ReutersSuit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billionaire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-14/george-soros-sued-by-fellow-billionaire-in-10-billion-mine-row|title=Soros Sued by Fellow Billionaire in $10 Billion Mine Brawl|date=14 April 2017|publisher=Bloomberg News|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Soros spokesman called the allegations "frivolous and entirely false" and described the lawsuit as "a desperate [[PR stunt]] meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;Tara Cunningham, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/04/15/miner-bsg-resources-sues-billionaire-george-soros-loss-guinea "Miner BSG Resources sues billionaire George Soros over loss of Guinea iron project"], ''Telegraph'', 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2016, Steimetz was indicted [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] by Romanian [[National Anticorruption Directorate]], on charges of the unlawful recovery of [[Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern]]'s inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/actualitate/dna-cere-arestarea-strategului-lui-basescu-345480.html|title=Bombă aruncată de DNA: Se cere arestarea a patru afaceriști extrem de influenţi|publisher=antena3|date=10 March 2016|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court in Romania dismissed the request for a warrant for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-romanian-court-refuses-arrest-warrant-for-beny-steinmetz-1001126076|title=Romanian court refuses Steinmetz arrest warrant|website=Globes|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2017, Steinmetz was  arrested as part of a joint investigation by Israeli and Swiss anti-corruption officials over allegations of fraud, breach of trust, bribery, obstruction of justice and false registration of corporate documents" with the apparent purpose of money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-billionaire-arrested-in-international-money-laundering-probe-502413|title=Israeli billionaire arrested in int'l money laundering probe|last1=Eisenbud |first1=Daniel|last2=Shaham|first2=Udi|date=14 August 2017|website=jpost.com|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
In 2007, Steinmetz and his wife Agnes founded the Agnes and Beny Steinmetz Foundation in order to unify their multiple volunteer activities under the auspices of one philanthropic organization. The Foundation is primarily engaged in financing projects in the fields of education, healthcare, and culture for young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1001158166|title=מי הגיע לאירוע ההוקרה של קרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ? - גלובס|website=Globes|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agnes and Beny Steinmetz Foundation also supports programs that work with at-risk youth, runs after-school facilities for children from disadvantaged families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetz-foundation.com/?module=category&amp;item_id=20|title=The Agnes &amp; Beny Steinmetz Foundation|website=www.steinmetz-foundation.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers scholarships to students from difficult socio-economic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netanya.ac.il/Interested/Scholarships/Pages/Scholarships7.aspx|title=netanya.ac.il/Interested/Scholarships/Pages/Scholarships7.aspx|website=www.netanya.ac.il|language=he-il|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also donates to several organizations and institutions, including the Tel Aviv Museum, the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers (mainly supporting the soldiers of the Tzabar Battalion Of the Givati Brigade),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ametz.awis.org.il/1147-2|title=חוגגים עשור לקרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ {{!}} המגזין של פרויקט אמץ לוחם|website=ametz.awis.org.il|language=he-IL|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Israel Cancer Association, and various hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com/he/home|title=קרן אניאס ובני שטיינמץ {{!}} עמוד הבית|website=www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com|language=he-il|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, the Foundation held a festive event to celebrate a decade of giving. Attendants included representatives of the many organizations the Foundation had supported over the years by contributing a cumulative amount of tens of millions of shekels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steinmetzfoundationnews.com/ten-years-celebration|title=אירוע חגיגת עשור לקרן אניאס ובני שטינמץ|website=steinmetzfoundationnews.com|access-date=21 February 2018|language=he-il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Books+Publishing''''' magazine (formerly '''''Bookseller+Publisher''''' and '''''Australian Bookseller &amp; Publisher''''') is the quarterly journal of the Australian [[book industry]]&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite news|title=About Books+Publishing|url=http://www.booksandpublishing.com.au/about/|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Books+Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of Australia's oldest surviving magazines. The magazine contains book news, author interviews, category round-ups and features on forthcoming books, and pre-publication reviews of Australian and New Zealand books.

==History==
''Books+Publishing'' magazine was founded in 1921&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=bow&gt;{{cite web|title=Books+Publishing Magazine|url=http://www.bowker.com/products/BooksPublishing.html|work=Bowker|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Daniel Wrixon Thorpe as the '''''Australian Stationery and Fancy Goods Journal''''', at a time when there were few Australian retailers solely focused on the sale of books. The magazine has been continuously [[published]] ever since, changing its name to ''Ideas'' in the 1937. The name then change to ''Australian Bookseller &amp; Publisher'' in 1971 when the D W Thorpe company was taken over by Thorpe's daughter, [[Joyce Nicholson]].&lt;ref name=numbering&gt;{{cite web|title=Books+Publishing magazine numbering|url=https://www.booksandpublishing.com.au/magazine-numbering/|accessdate=18 May 2018|website=Books+Publishing|publisher=Books+Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the company began publishing the ''Weekly Book Newsletter''—an offshoot of the magazine—containing weekly book-industry news and became colloquially known as the ''Blue News'', because of the blue paper it was printed on.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Joyce &amp; Thorpe, Daniel Wrixon (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PPq_3dPi_XIC ''A Life of Books: The Story of D.W. Thorpe Pty. Ltd., 1921-1987''], Courtyard Press, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-646-39611-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Craig &amp; Sheahan-Bright, Robyn (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VRM7i0OhEIkC ''Paper Empires: A History of the Book in Australia 1946-2005''], University of Queensland Press, Brisbane. {{ISBN|0-7022-3573-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The D W Thorpe company was sold to Reed Reference Publishing in 1992, then sold to [[R.R. Bowker]] in 2001, and the company became Thorpe-Bowker in 2003.&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; (R.R. Bowker is currently owned by [[ProQuest]].) 

The word 'Australian' was dropped from the magazine's title at the start of 2006 to become ''Bookseller+Publisher'', partly in acknowledgement of Australia's growing role as a publishing and [[bookselling]] hub for the entire Asia-Pacific region. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Database of Bookseller+Publisher magazine (2006 to 2012)|url=https://search.informit.org/browseJournalTitle;res=IELAPA;issn=1833-5403|accessdate=18 May 2018|website=Informit |publisher=Informit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the ''Weekly Book Newsletter'', became an online newsletter that is emailed to subscribers and available on the website. 

The publication was renamed to ''Books+Publishing'' in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Database of Books+Publishing (2013 to 2018)|url=https://search.informit.org/browseJournalTitle;res=IELLCC;issn=2201-5892|accessdate=18 May 2018|website=Informit |publisher=Informit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the newsletter ''Library News'' that Thorpe-Bowker had acquired in 2007 was folded into the renamed publication. Two offshoot newsletters carrying book reviews, the ''Reviews Newsletter'' and the ''Junior Newsletter'', began in 2012, and one year later the first ''Daily Newsletter'' was sent out to subscribers containing news about the book industry on a daily basis, which is republished in the ''Weekly Book Newsletter''. The ''Think Australian Newsletter'' and ''Think Australian Junior Newsletter'' were established in 2017, containing news about the sale of rights of Australian titles for an international audience.

On 1 July 2018, Thorpe-Bowker sold the entire ''Books+Publishing'' publication, including the magazine, newsletters and website, to Thorpe-Bowker General Manager Gary Pengelly, under the company Books and Publishing Pty Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pengelly buys ‘Books+Publishing’.

'''Business licenses''' are permits issued by [[government agency|government agencies]] that allow individuals or companies to conduct business within the government's geographical [[jurisdiction]].  It is the authorization to start a business issued by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A single jurisdiction often requires multiple licenses that are issued by multiple government departments and agencies. Business licenses vary between countries, states, and local municipalities. There are often many licenses, registrations and certifications required to conduct a business in a single location.

Typically, a company's business activity and physical location (address) determines which licenses are required to operate lawfully. Other determining factors may include the number of employees and the [[business#Basic forms of ownership|form of business ownership]], such as sole proprietor or corporation. Government agencies can fine or close a business operating without the required business licenses.

==Licensing and business registration requirements==
===United States===
In the United States, the [[Small Business Administration]] has a list of links to State websites for State licensing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/hotlist/license.html SBA: Where to Obtain Business Licenses] Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Each State has its own business registration and licensing requirements. [[Business.usa.gov]] is an official business link to the U.S. Government. Business.gov, managed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.

====Example: Washington, D.C.====
In [[Washington, D.C.]]
::The '''Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs''' (DCRA) is the District of Columbia's regulatory agency. DCRA ensures the health, safety, and economic welfare of District residents through licensing, inspection, compliance, and enforcement programs. In addition, '''Department of Health''' (DOH) issues certain professional licenses, '''[[District of Columbia Department of Transportation|District Department of Transportation]]''' (DDOT) regulates public space, and '''Office of Zoning''' (DCOZ) controls land use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brc.dc.gov/licenses/licenses.asp Washington, D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs - Licenses and Permits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404044839/http://brc.dc.gov/licenses/licenses.asp |date=April 4, 2007 }} Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most individuals and companies doing business in the District of Columbia must obtain a Basic Business License from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mblr.dc.gov/ Washington, D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs - Basic Business License Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401143835/http://mblr.dc.gov/ |date=April 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, organizations (including non-profits and cooperatives, but not including sole-proprietorships and general partnerships) must register their business. Many types of businesses require additional certification or permits beyond the Basic Business License and registration. D.C. requires a "Clean Hands Self-Certification" from most applicants, which is an affidavit stating that the applicant does not owe more than $100 to the District. Tour Guides must submit a Physician's Certificate. Fees for businesses licenses vary. The fee for a Special Event license such as a marathon is $209. The license for a movie theater costs $1,079 per year, for a grocery store $289 per year, for a beauty shop $78 per year. (2003 schedule of fees, current as of March 2007) A Project Management Firm does not require a Basic Business License, nor does a Handyman. Residential House Painters must submit a Home Improvement Contract signed by the homeowner.

Physicians and other health care professionals require licenses from the Professional Licensing Administration in the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpla.doh.dc.gov/hpla/cwp/view,a,1195,q,488169,hplaNav, |30661|,.asp Washington, D.C.

====Example: Pennsylvania====
Pennsylvania allows online registration of small business start-ups, but does not provide licensing guidance.

::The OBRI is a business registration tool and is not intended to be a replacement for professional consultation with qualified practitioners.  The laws and regulations governing business start-up, practice, and expansion are varied and compliance with such standards depends upon the particular circumstances of a business.  If legal advice or other expert assistance is required, the services of a competent professional should be sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sohanroy.com Pennsylvania Online Business Registration Interview] Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain actions are required by all businesses in Pennsylvania in order for them to continue in business in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paopen4businessbriefcase.state.pa.us/tax/default.asp?LN=380&amp;LG=41 Pennsylvania - Forms for all Businesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513050047/http://www.paopen4businessbriefcase.state.pa.us/tax/default.asp?LN=380&amp;LG=41 |date=May 13, 2007 }} Accessed 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes New Hire Reporting (including reporting oneself as a new hire when starting a business).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''chief compliance officer''' ('''CCO''') of a company is the officer primarily responsible for overseeing and managing [[regulatory compliance]] issues within an organization. The CCO typically reports to the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Office]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r or [[Chief operating officer|Chief Operations Officer]]. 

The role has long existed at companies that operate in heavily regulated industries such as [[financial services]] and [[healthcare]]. For other companies, the rash of 2000s [[accounting scandals]], the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], and the recommendations of the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines have led to additional CCO appointments. 

Scott Cohen, editor and publisher of ''[[Compliance Week]]'', dates the proliferation of CCOs to a 2002 speech by SEC commissioner [[Cynthia Glassman]], in which she called on companies to designate a "corporate responsibility officer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch586.htm SEC Commissioner's Speech: Sarbanes-Oxley and the Idea of "Good" Governance (Cynthia A. Glassman)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities of the position often include leading enterprise compliance efforts, designing and implementing internal controls, policies and procedures to assure compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations and third party guidelines; managing audits and investigations into regulatory and compliance issues; and responding to requests for information from regulatory bodies.

'''Control self-assessment''' is a technique developed in 1987 that is used by a range of organisations including corporations, charities and government departments, to assess the effectiveness of their risk management and control processes.

A "control process" is a check or process performed to reduce or [[risk elimination|eliminate the risk]] of error. Since its introduction the technique has been widely adopted in the United States, European Union and other countries. There are a number of ways a control self-assessment can be implemented but its key feature is that, in contrast to a traditional [[audit]], the tests and checks are made by staff whose normal day-to-day responsibilities are within the business unit being assessed.&lt;ref name=CPAJournal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/1205/essentials/p38.htm|title=The Use of Control Self-Assessment by Independent Auditors|author1=Gilbert W. Joseph |author2=Terry J. Engle |date=December 2005|accessdate=2012-03-10|publisher=The CPA Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-assessment, by identifying the higher risk processes within the organisation, allows [[internal auditor]]s to plan their work more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiia.org/training/index.cfm?act=seminar.detail&amp;semID=38|title=Control Self-assessment: An Introduction|publisher=[[The Institute of Internal Auditors]]|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of governmental organisations require the use of control self-assessment. In the [[United States]] it is a requirement of the [[FFIEC]] that control self-assessments are performed on IT systems and operational processes on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/operations/risk-assessment-.aspx|title=FFIEC IT Examination Handbook|publisher=FFIEC|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits claimed for control self-assessment include creating a clear line of accountability for controls, reducing the risk of fraud and the creation of an organisation with a lower risk profile.&lt;ref name=accountingweb/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Internal Auditing Handbook|edition=3rd|author=Spencer Pickett, K.H.|author2=Pickett, Jennifer M.|last-author-amp=yes|page=585|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain circumstances control self-assessment is not always effective. For example, it can be difficult to implement in a decentralised environment, in organisations where there is high employee turnover, where the organisation goes through frequent change or where the senior management of the organisation does not foster a culture of open communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protiviti.com/en-US/Documents/White-Papers/Industries/Control_Self_Assessment_Whitepaper.pdf|title=Control Self-Assessment:The Future of Store Audits in Retail Stores|publisher=Protivit Incorporated|year=2006|accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and worldwide adoption==

Control self-assessment was developed by Gulf Canada in 1987 when the company's [[Chief audit executive|General Auditor]], Bruce McCuaig was dissatisfied with the standard auditing techniques in use following the impact of the [[Watergate]] affair on the parent company, [[Gulf Oil|Gulf Oil Corporation]]. The decision to fully implement control self-assessment at Gulf Canada was driven by a number of factors. These included the presence of a [[consent decree]] requiring the company to report on its internal controls and the difficulties it was facing in estimating its oil and gas reserves using more traditional audit measures.&lt;ref name=profpractice&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iiajapan.com/pdf/data/csa/pp98-2.pdf|title=Professional Practice Pamphlet 98-2 A Perspective on Control Self-Assessment|publisher=[[The Institute of Internal Auditors]]|location=[[Florida]]|year=1998|ISBN=089413406X|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next ten years Gulf Canada developed a framework to support the analysis and evaluation of control processes by operational staff. This included anonymous voting to ensure there was no impediment to staff expressing their views. The approach was first published in ''[[Internal Auditor]]'' in December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essential Guide to Internal Auditing|edition=Second|author=K.H. Spencer Pickett|page=81|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Limited|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulf Canada discontinued this facilitated meeting approach in 1997 although it continued with control self-assessment using different techniques.&lt;ref name=profpractice/&gt;

Following Gulf Canada's introduction of control self-assessment many private sector organisations implemented similar techniques. In the United States several states made reviews based on control self-assessment practices mandatory as did the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] and the [[Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation]].&lt;ref name=profpractice/&gt;

Initially external auditors ignored the benefits of control self-assessment even though it was effective at providing audit evidence around the "soft" areas (such as staff morale) that are critical to the effectiveness of internal control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management/1071523-1.html|title=Use of control self-assessment in audits|accessdate=2012-03-12|date=1 August 2001|publisher=The CPA Journal|author=Joseph, Gilbert W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of financial scandals, notably the collapse of [[Robert Maxwell]]'s publishing empire, the United Kingdom government commissioned [[Adrian Cadbury]] to chair an investigation into corporate governance. The committee published its report [[Cadbury Report|''The Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'']] in 1992. In section 4, Reporting and Controls, Cadbury made a number of recommendations that led to the increased adoption of control self-assessment in the UK. In particular section 4.5 of the Code of Practice contained within the report required that the directors of a company should report on the effectiveness of the company's system of internal control in each [[annual report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ecgi.org/codes/documents/cadbury.pdf|title=Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance|date=1 December 1992|ISBN=0852589131|accessdate=2012-03-12|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000 the [[European Commission]] approved a white paper on reform that led to a major change in the way the Commission was managed. These changes included recommendations for each department to establish an effective internal control system. To support the implementation of the internal controls the [[Directorate-General for Budget]]'s Central Financial Service developed a control self-assessment process. This first control self-assessment identified several areas for improvement in internal control across the Commission most notably the need to implement a more systematic approach to risk management. The outcome of this first self-assessment was the implementation of the requirement for every [[Directorate General]] to perform a control and risk self-assessment annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4qconference.org/en/previous_quality/2QC/The_Internal_Control_and_Risk_Self-Assessment.doc|title=2nd Quality Conference for Public Administration in the EU: Note for the File|author=Central Financial Service, European Commission|author2-link=European Commission|date=18 March 2002|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the United States implemented the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].  In order to comply with section 404 of the Act the company had to perform a top down risk assessment which necessitated the production of an "internal control report" that affirmed "the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting."  {{uscsub|15|7262|a}}. This report has to include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures that are related to financial reporting. To meet this requirement organisations increasingly began to perform a control self-assessment using a recognised standard methodology. The organisation's external auditors, who are required to sign-off the internal control report, typically became more deeply involved in the control self-assessment process as it facilitated their later review of the internal control report.&lt;ref name=IIEAC&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theiia.org/CSA/index.cfm?iid=537&amp;catid=0&amp;aid=2670|title=Improving Internal and External Audit Coordination|author1=Engel, Terry J. |author2=Joseph, Gilbert W.|agency=[[The Institute of Internal Auditors]]|publisher=CSA Sentinel|volume=11|number=2|year=2007|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2011 the [[Financial Services Authority]] recognised in its recommendations for the improvement of operational risk management that the assessment of risks through a control self-assessment may be an important means of identifying risks. It also noted that for the assessment to be fully effective it had to be fully integrated into the financial organisation's risk-management process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/guidance/guidance11.pdf|publisher=[[Financial Services Authority]]|date=January 2011|title=Enhancing frameworks in the standardised approach to operational risk – Guidance note|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performing the control self-assessment ==
[[File:Transit Board control self-assessment form.jpg|thumb|right|Section 1 of the control self-assessment form used by the [[Federal Transit Administration]]]]
The first step in control self-assessment is to document the organisation's control processes with the aim of identifying suitable ways of measuring or testing each control. The actual testing of the controls is performed by staff whose day-to-day role is within the area of the organisation that is being examined as they have the greatest knowledge of how the processes operate.&lt;ref name=CPAJournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=accountingweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingweb.com/item/104210|title=Control self-assessment:Everybody pitching in with internal controls|author=McNally, J.Stephen|publisher=accountingweb|date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two common techniques for performing the evaluations are:

* Workshops, that may be but do not have to be independently facilitated, involving some or all staff from the business unit being tested;
* Surveys or questionnaires completed independently by the staff.

Both approaches are the opposite of formal audits where the [[auditor]]s, not the business unit staff, will perform the assessment.&lt;ref name=CPAJournal/&gt;

On completion of the assessment each control may be rated based on the responses received to determine the probability of its failure and the impact if a failure occurred. These ratings can be mapped to produce a [[heatmap]] showing potential areas of vulnerability.

==Methodologies==
[[File:Risk and Control Impact Assessment.JPG|thumb|A heatmap produced from the information captured in a control self-assessment. The cluster of issues in the red and amber sections of the heatmap indicate that this is a high risk area and probably in need of new or changed control processes.]]
Six basic methodologies for control self-assessment have been defined:&lt;ref name=ISACA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.isaca.org/Journal/Past-Issues/2004/Volume-1/Pages/Control-Self-assessment-for-Information-and-Related-Technology.aspx|title=Control Self-assessment for Information and Related Technology|volume=1|year=2004|author=Sunil Bakshi|journal=Journal of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) self-audit
*Customised questionnaires
*Control guides
*Interview techniques
*Control model workshops
*Interactive workshops

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] control self-assessment methodology is based on customised questionnaires. It is an [[Information technology|IT]] focused methodology suitable for assessing system based controls. It provides a cost-effective technique to determine the status of information security controls, identify any weaknesses and, where necessary, define an improvement plan.&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnsep01.htm|title=Security Self-assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems|author=Marianne Swanson|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology uses a questionnaire that contains specific control objectives and techniques against a system or group of systems can be tested and measured. The methodology was designed for United States federal agencies but can also be valuable for private sector organisations.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;

The [[COBIT]] methodology can be used for control self-assessment; like the NIST methodology it was designed for IT focused assessments. COBIT's Process Description component provides a reference model of an organisation's processes and their ownership. Its Control Objectives component provides a set of requirements considered necessary for effective control of each IT process with the organisation. Assessment and evaluation of these components using the Management Guidelines component provides an assessment mechanism that generates a maturity model indicating if the organisation is meeting its control objectives.&lt;ref name=ISACA/&gt;
 
The [[Institute of Internal Auditors]] based its control self-assessment methodology on the [[Total Quality Management]] approaches of the 1990s as well as the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO's]] framework. The methodology became part of the ''International Standards for Professional Practice of Internal Auditing'' and was adopted by a large number of major organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brink's Modern Internal Auditing: A Common Body of Knowledge|author=Robert Moeller|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., Canada|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other methodologies to standardise the control self-assessment have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Álvarez, Gene|title=Operational Risk: Practical Approaches to Implementation|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risk.net/operational-risk-and-regulation/feature/1900537/comprehensive-risk-control-self-assessment-methodology|title=A comprehensive risk and control self-assessment methodology|author1=Gene Álvarez |author2=Phil Gledhill |date=24 November 2010|publisher=Risk.net|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Internal Auditors offers a certification in control self-assessment practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiia.org/certification/specialty-certifications/ccsa/|publisher=[[Institute of Internal Auditors]]|title=Certification in Control Self Assessment (CCSA)|accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software tools==

A number of software packages are available to support the control self-assessment process. These are typically modified versions of software developed originally for internal use by audit and accountancy firms such as [[Deloitte]] or by niche vendors specialising in business or financial management tools.

==Benefits==
Control self-assessment creates a clear line of accountability for controls, reduces the risk of [[fraud]] (by examining data that may flag unusual patterns of transactions) and results in an organisation with a lower risk profile.&lt;ref name=accountingweb/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd"/&gt;

A number of other soft benefits have been claimed for organisations performing control self-assessment. These include a better understanding of business operations (by both management and operational staff); stronger awareness of risk practices; a reinforced [[corporate governance]] regime and internal audit efficiency improvements.&lt;ref name=accountingweb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/th/en/performance-improvement/control-self-assessment.jhtml|accessdate=2012-03-10|publisher=[[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]]|title=Control Self Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some researchers have criticised control self-assessment as a flawed approach as the way risk is defined and measured is unsophisticated. In particular, control self-assessment may understate risk by not identifying extreme downside risk. An extreme downside risk is a highly improbable event that would have catastrophic consequences if it occurred. These risks should have a high overall risk score (generally calculated as a product of the probability of a risk occurring and the impact if it does occur on a scale of 1 to 5). Individuals performing the control self-assessment are consequently unable to significantly differentiate between risks leading to extreme low probability risks either being excluded from the analysis or grouped together with other more probable (but still unlikely) risks that have a less severe impact.&lt;ref name=Dragonfly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dragonflyone.com/docs/Dragonfly_Risk_Insights_CSA_A4_s.pdf|title=Companies Using Control Self Assessment Don't Really Know their Risk|author1=Lee, Judy |author2=Wee, Lieng-Seng|publisher=Dragonfly|accessdate=2012-03-14|date=28 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continual focus on risk elimination that a control self-assessment can lead to has also been criticised. The process of continual evaluation of risks and making plans to mitigate and eliminate them may lead to an unbalanced corporate culture where risks are eliminated ignoring the risk-return ratio of different business choices.&lt;ref name=Dragonfly/&gt;

He was the CEO of Indonesia's State Electricity Company, ([[Perusahaan Listrik Negara|PLN]]) from December 23, 2009 to October, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; He was Indonesia's minister for [[State-owned enterprise]]s in the period October 2011 to October 2014.

[[File:Dahlan Iskan.jpg|right|thumb|Dahlan Iskan in 2013]]

Dahlan is known for his unorthodox, often personalised, approach to solving internal bureaucratic problems and inefficiencies within stated-owned enterprises (SOEs). Over time, he came to have been seen as a somewhat controversial figure.  His style as a minister sometimes attracted criticism from members of the [[People's Representative Council|Indonesian parliament]] (MPs).&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S, Azwar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/23/lawmakers-target-dahlan-and-his-antics.html Politics: Lawmakers target Dahlan and his antics'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He responded vigorously to criticisms from parliamentarians by threatening to expose details of payments allegedly made by SOEs in order to be able to meet MPs in parliamentary commission hearings. He also supported the Indonesian development of an environmentally friendly car, one of which he often drove himself. However, in a much-publicised incident, he crashed one of the electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;Kusumasari Ayuningtyas and Wahyoe Boediwardhana, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/05/dahlan-rams-local-sports-car-mountain-slope.html Dahlan rams local sports car into mountain slope'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dahlan Iskan is also the author of ''No such thing as Can't'', the biography of Karmaka Surjaudaja, the founder of bank OCBC NISP in Indonesia which has close links with OCBC ([[Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Donny Syofan, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/04/dahlan-vs-house-lawmakers-replicates-david-vs-goliath-duel.html Dahlan vs House lawmakers replicates David vs Goliath duel?'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 4 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his term as minister for State Owned Enterprises, he is now traveling to some countries to harvest ideas on the area of his interest such as sustainable energy while reporting his observation and analysis in JPNN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">According to [[Ralph Kimball]],&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Ralph |last1=Kimball |first2=Margy |last2=Ross |title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling (Second Edition) |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Indianapolis, IN |year=2002 |pages=50, 398 |isbn=978-0-471-20024-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[data warehouse]], a '''degenerate dimension''' is a dimension key in the [[fact table]] that does not have its own [[dimension table]], because all the interesting attributes have been placed in analytic dimensions. The term "degenerate dimension" was originated by [[Ralph Kimball]].

As Bob Becker says:{{cquote|Degenerate dimensions commonly occur when the fact table's grain is a single transaction (or transaction line). Transaction control header numbers assigned by the operational business process are typically degenerate dimensions, such as order, ticket, credit card transaction, or check numbers. These degenerate dimensions are natural keys of the "parents" of the line items.&lt;br&gt;
Even though there is no corresponding dimension table of attributes, degenerate dimensions can be quite useful for grouping together related fact tables rows. For example, retail point-of-sale transaction numbers tie all the individual items purchased together into a single market basket. In health care, degenerate dimensions can group the claims items related to a single hospital stay or episode of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Bob|title=Design Tip #46: Another Look At Degenerate Dimensions|date=3 June 2003|url=http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/06/03/design-tip-46-another-look-at-degenerate-dimensions/|work=Fact Table Core Concepts|publisher=Kimball Group|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
Although most writers and practitioners use the term '''degenerate dimension''' correctly, it is very easy to find misleading definitions in online and printed sources. For example, the Oracle FAQ defines a degenerate dimension as a "data dimension that is stored in the fact table rather than a separate dimension table. This eliminates the need to join to a dimension table. You can use the data in the degenerate dimension to limit or 'slice and dice' your fact table measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degenerate dimension|url=http://orafaq.com/wiki/Degenerate_dimension|work=Oracle FAQ's|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This common interpretation implies that it is good dimensional modeling practice to place dimension attributes in the fact table, as long as you call them a degenerate dimension. This is not the case; the concept of '''degenerate dimension''' was developed by Kimball to support a specific, well-defined exception to the otherwise ironclad rule that dimension attributes are always pulled out into dimension tables.

{{Other uses|Depletion (disambiguation)}}

'''Depletion''' is an [[accounting]] and [[tax]] concept used most often in [[mining]], [[timber]], [[petroleum]], or other similar industries. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of a product's reserves. Depletion is similar to [[depreciation]] in that it is a cost recovery system for accounting and tax reporting. 

Depletion, for both accounting purposes and [[Internal Revenue Service|United States tax purposes]], is a method of recording the gradual expense or use of [[natural resource]]s over time.  Depletion is the using up of natural resources by [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[Boring (earth)|drilling]], or [[logging|felling]].

According to the [[IRS]] Newswire,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=120930,00.html IRS Issues Guidance on Recoverable Reserves]&lt;/ref&gt; over 50 percent of oil and gas extraction businesses use cost depletion to figure their depletion deduction. Mineral property includes oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits). For that purpose, property is each separate interest businesses own in each [[mineral deposit]] in each separate tract or parcel of land. Businesses can treat two or more separate interests as one property or as separate properties.

==Types of depletion==
For tax purposes, the two types of depletion are percentage depletion and cost depletion.
 
For mineral property, one generally must use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, one must use cost depletion.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch09.html Publication 535 (2007), Business Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percentage depletion===
To figure percentage depletion, one multiplies a certain percentage, specified for each mineral, by gross income from the property during the tax year. The rates to be used and other conditions and qualifications for oil and gas wells are discussed below under ''Independent Producers and Royalty Owners'' and under ''Natural Gas Wells''. Rates and other rules for percentage depletion of other specific minerals are found later in ''Mines and Geothermal Deposits''.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"/&gt;

===Cost depletion===
Cost depletion is an accounting method by which costs of natural resources are allocated to depletion over the period that make up the life of the asset. Cost depletion is computed by estimating the total quantity of mineral or other resources acquired and assigning a proportionate amount of the total resource cost to the quantity extracted in the period. For example, if Big Texas Oil, Co. discovers a large reserve of oil, the company has estimated the oil well will produce 200,000 barrels of oil. The company invests $100,000 to extract the oil and extracts 10,000 barrels the first year. Therefore, the depletion deduction is $5,000 ($100,000 X 10,000/200,000).

Cost depletion for tax purposes may be completely different from cost depletion for accounting purposes:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = S/(R+S) \times AB = AB/(R+S) \times S &lt;/math&gt;
:CD = Cost Depletion.
:S =  Units sold in the current year
:R =  Reserves on hand at the end of the current year
:AB = Adjusted basis of the property at the end of the current year

==Accounting==
Adjusted basis is the basis at end of year adjusted for prior years depletion in cost or percentage. It automatically allows for adjustments to the basis during the taxable year.

By using the units remaining at the end of the year, the adjustment automatically allows for revised estimates of the reserves.

Depletion is based upon sales and not production. Units are considered sold in the year the proceeds are taxable under the taxpayer's accounting method.

==Reserves==
Reserves generally include proven developed reserves and "probable" or "prospective" reserves if there is reasonable evidence to have believed that such quantities existed at that time.

==Example==
If producer X has capitalized costs on property A of $40,000, originally consisting of the lease bonus, capitalized exploration costs, and some capitalized carrying costs, and the lease has been producing for several years and during this time, X has claimed $10,000 of allowable depletion. In 2009, X's share of production sold was 40,000 barrels and an engineer's report indicated that 160,000 barrels could be recovered after December 31, 2009.

The calculation of cost depletion for this lease would be as follows:

:Cost depletion = S/(R+S) × AB or AB/(R+S) × S
:CD = 40,000/(40,000 + 160,000) × ($40,000 − $10,000)   
:   = 40,000/200,000          × $30,000    
:   = $6,000

In [[Plastics engineering|plastics processing]], dip molding is a process of shaping of plastics by [[Molding (process)|moulding]].&amp;nbsp;The coating of components with PVC has many applications. Plastic dip moulding is a technique where metal parts are coated with a [[Plastisol|plastic vinyl]] material.&lt;ref name="LeadbitterDay1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Leadbitter|author2=J. A. Day|author3=J. L.

Ross|title=Handbook of Metal Treatments and Testing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO9dSoi0P6gC&amp;pg=PA94|date=30 September 1988|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-412-31390-5|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The main applications are the [[glove]]s, [[balloon]]s, , [[bellows]]...

== Materials ==
Plastisol is the most used material for dip moulding because it is easy to use and affordable. Other materials are used, such as [[latex]], leneoprene, [[polyurethane]]s, [[silicone]]s and even [[epoxy]].

== Operating Mode ==
The plastic can be heated or not according to their physical state at room temperature. In the case of a powder, the plastic is fluidized.

The following steps constitute the dip moulding process:
* mould heating;
* heated mould dipped into the plastic material;
* removal of the mould;
* excess drainage;
* drying or curing of the plastics material still attached to the mould if it contained a solvent or was based reagents ([[monomer]]s, [[prepolymer]]s) reagents;
* cooling of the plastic still attached to the mould;
* releasing of the part from the mold after its solidification.
The part may need to be submerged several times to give the desired thickness.

== Control of the thickness ==
To control the thickness of the workpiece, it is important to control the following settings:
* the mould temperature: higher the temperature, higher the thickness of the workpiece.
* the temperature of the material;
* the speed dipping of the mould;
* the duration of the immersion: this time increases the thickness of the workpiece.
* the output speed of the mould: this speed increases the thickness of the workpiece.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Dip moulding presents advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.efunda.com/processes/plastic_molding/molding_dip.cfm|title=eFunda: Introduction to Dip Molding and Coating|last=Inc.|first=eFunda,|website=www.efunda.com|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
* low investment cost;
* low cost of production;
* different possible thicknesses without the need to change the mold;
* complex parts can be removed easily from the mold thanks to their elasticity;

=== Disadvantages ===
* relatively slow process;
* control of the thickness is difficult.

'''Disciplinary probation''' is a disciplinary status that can apply to [[student]]s at a higher educational institution&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt; or to [[employee]]s in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For employees, it can result from both poor performance at work or from misconduct.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For students, it results from misconduct alone, with poor academic performance instead resulting in [[scholastic probation]].&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;

For a student, disciplinary probation means that the student is on formal notice, and subject to special rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt; The violation of these rules may lead to more severe forms of discipline, such as suspension, dismissal, and expulsion.&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt;

For employees, disciplinary probation is one common step in a scheme of [[progressive discipline]]. It is a common replacement, in non-unionized workplaces, for the progressive disciplinary step of suspension without pay. A usual period for such probation is 90 days.&lt;ref name=Grote2006 /&gt;
Some companies may place permanent employees on probationary status, particularly if their performance is below a set standard or for disciplinary reasons. In this instance, the employee is usually given a period of time to either improve their performance or modify their behaviour before more severe measures are taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7610">'''Farbrausch''', or '''Farb-rausch''', is a [[Germany|German]] group of [[demogroup|demomakers]] who became well known in the [[demoscene]] in December 2000 with a [[64k intro]] called "fr-08: .the .product". The demo achieved its small size through the use of [[procedural textures]], a custom MIDI-based [[software synthesizer]] V2 (controlled through a sequencer called [[Logic Audio]]), and a modified version of [[UPX]] executable compressor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soyoucode.com/2011/coding-giant-under-microscope-farbrausch |title = Coding a giant under the microscope: Farbrausch}}&lt;/ref&gt; ".the .product" is an 11-minute [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] show featuring complex scenes of [[computer generated imagery]].

Their work has won numerous awards. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called "'''.theprodukkt'''" released a 96kB first-person shooter game named "[[.kkrieger]]", and an earlier version of the [[demomaker|tool]] they currently use to produce some of their demos, named "[[.werkkzeug]]", or "Tool".

Farbrausch gives their releases a "product code", in the format "fr-0#".  The numbers do not specify the order of release &amp;mdash; the members have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the project, not when they finish it. Non-serious releases receive negative numbers.

The group has periodically released improved compositions such as "fr-019: Poem to a Horse", "fr-030: Candytron"  or "fr-025: The.Popular.Demo". ''The.Popular.Demo'' and ''debris.'' are among the most highly favored demos on the demoscene index, [[Pouët|Pouet]]. The.Popular.Demo also received the "Public Choice Award" from the 2003 scene.org awards, and ''debris.'' won the 2007 scene.org award for best direction.

In 2009, Farbrausch released [[.detuned]], an interactive demo for the [[PlayStation 3]], again under the name .theprodukkt.

In 2012 Farbrausch released the [[source code]] of many of their demotools on [[github.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/farbrausch/fr_public fr_public] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Friedrich ('Fritz') Mandl''' (9 February 1900 – 8 September 1977) was chairman of [[Hirtenberg]]er [[Otto Eberhardt Patronenfabrik|Patronen-Fabrik]], a leading Austrian armaments firm founded by his father, Alexander Mandl.
[[Image:Wöllersdorf Feuerwerksfabrik 2.JPG|300px|thumb|The Wöllersdorfer cartridge factory, from October 1933, the site of the holding camp [[Wöllersdorf]]]]

A prominent [[fascist]], Mandl was attached to the [[Austrofascism]] and Italian varieties and an [[German resistance to Nazism|opponent of Nazism]]. In the 1930s he became close to Prince [[Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg]], the commander of the Austrian nationalist militia ("[[Heimwehr]]"), which he furnished with weapons and ammunition.&lt;ref name=Hanauska/&gt;

Until 1940, Mandl tried to establish contact with [[Hermann Göring]]'s office in order to supply Germany with iron.&lt;ref name=Lavoz/&gt;

==Marriages== 

Mandl was married five times.&lt;ref name=MandlGeni/&gt; His wives were:

Helene Hella Mandl, Née Strauss, born 1899, Vienna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Helene-Mandl/6000000010733147221|title=Helene Hella Mandl|publisher=geni.com|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he was married at the age of 21- the marriage lasted for six weeks.&lt;ref name=Lavoz/&gt;  

[[Hedy Lamarr]], Née Kiesler, born 1914, Vienna (see below)&lt;ref name=MandlGeni&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Fredrich-Mandl/6000000009716686400|title=Fredrich Alexander Maria (Fritz) Mandl|publisher=geni.com|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Hedy-Lamarr/6000000009710927263 Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, Also Known As: "Hedy Lamarr"] ''geni.com'', accessed 19 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;They married in 1933 and divorced in 1937 or 1938.

Herta Mandl, Née Wrany, born 1911, Steiermark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Herta-Mandl/6000000010732659113|title=Herta Mandl|publisher=geni.com|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The LaVoz article suggests she was also known as Schneider, and was with him in Buenos Aires in 1938)&lt;ref name=Lavoz/&gt; They married in 1939 and divorced in 1951.

Gloria de Quaranta, Née Vinelli, born 1922, Buenos Aires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Gloria-de-Quaranta/6000000010733113363|title=Gloria de Quaranta|publisher=geni.com|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in 1951; she died in 1976. 

Mandl's last marriage was to his secretary Monika Brücklmeier,&lt;ref name=Lavoz/&gt; daughter of [[Eduard Brücklmeier]], an accessory executed for his involvement in the [[July 20 plot]] to assassinate Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Monika-Mandl/6000000010732717957|title=Monika Mandl|publisher=geni.com|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Hedy Lamarr== 

From 1933 to 1937, Mandl was married to Austrian actress Hedwig "Hedy" Kiesler, who would later become known as Hedy Lamarr in [[Hollywood]]. Both Hedy Lamarr's parents were born Jewish, but her mother converted to Roman Catholicism and Hedy was brought up Catholic. Her first "serious" film was ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]'' for which she was highly acclaimed at the time. Mandl is rumoured to have attempted to bring a halt to her acting career in Germany and to purchase all copies of her infamous film ''[[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]]'' (1933), in which she appeared nude.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Following incorporation of Austria into [[Nazi Germany]] with the [[Anschluss]] of 1938, Mandl's remaining property which had not yet been transferred to Swiss ownership was seized, since he had supported the separatist Austrofascism. His then-wife Lamarr wrote in her autobiography ''Ecstasy and Me'', that both Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] and German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] attended Mandl's parties. Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling, and wrote that she escaped only by disguising herself as a maid and fleeing to [[Paris]], where she obtained a divorce.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Later years==

Mandl later moved to Brazil and then to Argentina, where he became a citizen and remarried. In Argentina he served as an advisor to [[Juan Perón]] and attempted a new role as film producer. He also founded a new airplane manufacturing firm, Industria Metalúrgica y Plástica Argentina. Mandl became a leading member of Argentina's social circles. He acquired homes in [[Mar del Plata]], a castle in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and a small hotel in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=Lavoz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.lavoz.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=47377|title=LAVOZ.com.ar - Los secretos del castillo de Fritz Mandl - Página|publisher=lavoz.com.ar|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked closely with French designer [[Jean-Michel Frank]], who was then artistic director of Comte S.A.,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Emmanuel Martin-Viver; "JEAN-MICHEL FRANK - The Strange and Subtle Luxury of the Parisian Haute-Monde in the Art Deco Period"; pp. 74, 257–58.&lt;/ref&gt; who produced most of Mandl's furnishings. In 1955 he returned to Austria, where he resumed running the factory at Hirtenberg.&lt;ref name=Hanauska&gt;Fritz Hanauska: Heimatbuch der Marktgemeinde Hirtenberg.

A '''functional manager''' is a person who has [[management]] authority over an organizational unit—such as a department—within a business, company, or other [[organization]]. Functional managers have ongoing responsibilities, and are not usually directly affiliated with [[Project Management|project teams]], other than ensuring that goals and objectives align with the organization's overall strategy and vision.

In both traditional and matrix organizations, the control of the resources is centered on the functional managers,&lt;ref&gt;Seet, Daniel. [http://www.pmhut.com/power-the-functional-manager-meat-and-project-manager-poison "Power: The Functional Manager’s Meat and Project Manager’s Poison?"], ''PM Hut'', February 6, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; essentially putting project managers at a disadvantage when bargaining about staffing arrangements. Additionally, in such organizations, [[project manager]]s usually report to functional managers, who report to [[senior management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are duties of functional manager|url=http://www.ask.com/business-finance/duties-functional-manager-7dc2accaf872ffcd|website=Ask.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;



== Subject matter expert ==

*Give professional suggestion and provide direction to others within a department or section
*Convey knowledge to other employees

== Work management ==

*Tracking processes and managing tasks.
*Have understanding of their function's resources priorities and allocates resources to achieve better efficiency

== Process improvement ==

*Identify and address the inefficiency. 
*Provide necessary tools and coaching and education.
*Establish standards and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The role of functional managers in Agile|url=http://blogs.versionone.com/agile_management/2014/05/29/the-role-of-functional-managers-in-agile-from-tactical-to-strategic/|website=AGILE MANAGEMENT BLOG|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roles of functional managers can be defined by [[obligation]] and [[authority|authorities]]:
* Obligation means functional managers have to evaluate and assess the overall effectiveness and also give pertinent suggestion about resources allocation. They also have responsibility to make sure that the performance of their functions has been improved continuously and also to enhance cross-function integration.
* Authorities refer the rights of functional managers to establish specific standards and prescribe training and reporting, thus to help the compliance of the organisation's policies and requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Functional managers|url=http://fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-113.pdf|website=Fars.org|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The skills of functional managers==
To achieve an organisation's objectives, functional managers need a number of specific skills—for example: communication skills, decision making skills, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Function, role and skill of a manager|url=http://www.slideshare.net/rejulkhan1/function-role-and-skill-of-a-manager|website=Slideshare|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Technical skills are essential for functional managers, because they require specific knowledge and capabilities to accomplish their tasks.
*[[Communication skills]] refer to functional manager's ability to transfer the information to others effectively and efficiently. Functional managers need to convey information to subordinates so that subordinates are able to understand what is expected from higher authorities. Once they better understand overall goals and requirements, they work with colleagues to achieve the organisation's goals.
*Decision making skills require functional managers to have the ability to weight the positives and negatives of each decision. Moreover, this skill also require functional managers to recognize problems and opportunities quickly and correctly, then they should take appropriate actions to solve the problems or capitalize the opportunities.
*Functional managers also need interpersonal skills because they need to get along with people within or outside of their function, for example, senior managers or investors. Sometimes they need to face customers as well.
*Time management skills also essential for functional managers, they need to manage their work efficiently and delegate appropriately. A good functional manager should be able to accomplish tasks on time.

Although above skills are important to all types of managers, their relative importance tends to vary by various functions, for example, finance functional managers need to have skills about rising fund and financial analysis.

==Distinguish==

=== Functional manager VS project manager ===
Functional managers and [[project managers]] have different roles and duties within an organisation. Functional managers are accountable to manage people with specific skills  and different resources within a department or section to meet functional objectives as well as corporate objectives. Project managers must bring people together from different functions and specific skills to accomplish specialized tasks within a required time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the primary difference between a project manager and a functional manager|url=http://www.linkedin.com/groups/What-is-primary-difference-between-2775.S.115075531|website=Linkedin领英|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, both functional managers and project managers have to work together to share resources and experience . This may help to improve efficiency and overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Functional manager&amp; Project manager in the same organisation|url=http://www.projectarabgulf.com/2011/06/pm-fm/|website=Project Arab Gulf|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functional manager VS strategic manager ===
The strategic manager must view each action as it relates to the organization's larger strategic mission.They help the top leadership to prioritize business objectives and also help to provide strategies to capitalize opportunities and to avoid potential risks. Strategic managers should always have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills. However, the functional managers can concentrate on what is best for their specific sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between a strategic manager and a functional manager|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-strategic-manager-functional-manager-35884.html|website=Smallbusiness.chron.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functional manager VS line manager ===
Functional manager are always responsible for how their functions are carried out, and how their employees work to meet functional objectives. However, a [[line manager]] directly manages other employees and is responsible for administrative management of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Line manager|url=http://management.about.com/od/careerdevelopment/g/Line-Manager.htm|website=About Money|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone refers to their "boss" they mean the individual who is their line manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the line manager and functional manager|url=http://www.projectmanagementquestions.com/2058/difference-between-line-management-functional-management|website=Project Management Questions|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of functional managers==
Functional manager is in charge of a specific business unit or section such as Finance or Sales.Here are some examples of functional managers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The difference between a functional manager and a project manager|url=http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/1003/what-are-the-fundamental-differences-between-a-functional-manager-and-a-project|website=Project Management Beta|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 he volunteered for military service in the [[Reichswehr]], and served in an armoured reconnaissance battalion. In parallel to his military service he studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Stuttgart]]. Following his graduation in 1939, he transferred to the Luftwaffe. From July 1940 to January 1943 he served with [[Lehrgeschwader 2]] (Demonstration Wing) on both [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] and [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Fronts]]. He then converted to a [[ground attack]] role, and from March 1943 served with [[Schnellkampfgeschwader 10]] (10th Bomber Wing), flying fighter-bomber missions over southern England and anti-shipping operations in the English Channel and being appointed a squadron leader.&lt;ref name="Obermaier p105"&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on [[D-Day]] 6 June 1944, Eberspächer led four [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s of 3./SKG 10 (3rd Squadron of SKG 10) over [[Normandy]]. At 05:01 they had intercepted a formation of [[Royal Air Force]] [[Avro Lancaster]]s. Three were claimed as downed by Eberspächer, one of them being Lancaster ND739 of [[No. 97 Squadron RAF]], flown by the squadron's commanding officer, W/C Jimmie Carter. His seven-man crew had earned four [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]es and three [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s. The wreckage of ND739 was located and excavated in 2012. An assortment of items were recovered including the wedding ring belonging to crew member Albert Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=DailyMail |title=For the love of Vera: D-Day Lancaster bomber crew identified 68 years on by poignant inscription on dead airman's ring |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2211250/Wreckage-Lancaster-bomber-crashed-D-Day-killing-crew-identified.html#ixzz2NeLRUuC6|accessdate=16 March 2013|location=London|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga 2011, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eberspächer was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] on 24 January 1945, after 170 missions over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. He was credited with a total of seven aerial victories, including three at night.{{sfn|Brütting|1992|p=190}}

==Business career==
[[File:Jakob Eberspächer.jpg|thumb|right|Jakob Eberspächer, grandfather of Helmut and founder of the "Glasdachfabrik-Eberspächer".]]
After the war, Eberspächer joined the family business, which had been founded by his grandfather, Jakob Eberspächer, in 1865 as a plumber's workshop which was known as "Glasdachfabrik-Eberspächer" (Eberspächer Roof-Glazing). He succeeded [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] in 1978 as president of the ''Landesvereinigung Baden-Württembergischer Arbeitgeberverbände'' (State Federation of Baden-Württemberg Employers' Associations) after Schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the [[Red Army Faction]] on 18 October 1977. Eberspächer also supported the [[Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Eberspächer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart|title=Patrons|url=http://www.bachakademie.de/eng/836.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1989, in the aftermath of the [[Flick affair]], Eberspächer was fined 140,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] for [[tax evasion]]. He had transferred and donated more than 300,000 DM into the accounts of the political parties [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] via the "''Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wirtschaft Baden-Württemberg''" (the Society for the Advancement of Economics in Baden-Württemberg) between 1972 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|journal=Der Spiegel |volume=29|year=1989 |title=Kleines Licht|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13494402.html| language=German|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|journal=Der Spiegel |volume= 17|year=1989 |title=Mehr Steine als Brot|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13495402.html| language=German|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 19 June 2011 in [[Esslingen am Neckar]].&lt;ref name="Eberspächer"/&gt; The Eberspächer family are heirs of his business and are ranked 264th of the 500 richest Germans in 2013, with net assets of 450 Million Euros, an increase of 100 Million Euros over the year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Güneri |first=Emel |date=1 February 2013 |work=

Forms of imperfect competition include:

* [[Monopolistic competition]]: A situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation.
* [[Monopoly]]: A firm with no competitors in its industry. A monopoly firm produces less output, has higher costs, and sells its output for a higher price than it would if constrained by competition. These negative outcomes usually generate government regulation.
* [[Oligopoly]]: An industry with only a few firms. If they collude, they form a [[cartel]] to reduce output and drive up profits the way a monopoly does.
**[[Duopoly]]: A special form of Oligopoly, with only two firms in an industry.
* [[Monopsony]]: A market with a single buyer and many sellers.
* [[Oligopsony]]: A market with a few buyers and many sellers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Jesse Simons''' (November 5, 1917 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2006) was an American labor [[arbitrator]], who helped set in place a system of [[collective bargaining]] between [[Government of New York City|New York City]] (NYC) and its employees.

==Early life==

Simons was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Washington]] and the [[City University of New York|University of New York]], he failed to earn a degree from any of these institutions. Simons was a firm believer in [[Trade union|unionism]] and his politics during the 1930s and 1940s were [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]. During this period, he held a variety of jobs from [[machinist]] to [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator. From 1944-1946, Simons served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]].

==Career==
After [[demobilization]], Simons became Political Director of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]. He later became manager of Personnel and Industrial Relations for the [[New York Post]], a position he held until 1961.

From 1963-1966, Simons directed the [[American Arbitration Association]]'s Labor Management Institute. Following two lengthy strikes in 1965 by NYC employees, Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] convened a committee to create an independent agency to oversee municipal labor relations. Simons was an adviser to this committee and his contribution ultimately helped to bring about the NYC Collective Bargaining Law (1967). This law led to the formation of the NYC Office of Collective Bargaining, who mediate and arbitrate between the city and the bulk of its employees.

Simons died in New York, at age 88, from [[Congestive heart failure|heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/nyregion/12simons.html?ex=1310356800&amp;en=59ee2c785d68122b&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1231">'''Kristian Hindhede''' (surname pronounced as hin-d-her)(19 August 1891 – 8 January 1969) was a Danish [[civil engineer]] and [[industrialist]]. He was a son of the [[physician]] and [[nutritionist]] [[Mikkel Hindhede]].

In the 1920s, Kristian Hindhede pioneered the use of [[ready-mix concrete]] trucks with a horizontal rotating drum mixer. He is described as the [[inventor]] of this [[vehicle]] in the Danish [[Who's Who]] Kraks Blå Bog. As early as 1916, [[Stephen Stepanian]] of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the [[patent]] that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919. The poor quality of motor trucks at the time was a problem for inventors.

Hindhede's [[company]] A/S De danske Betonfabrikker (later renamed KH Beton) evolved into Unicon A/S, Scandinavia's largest supplier of ready-mix concrete. It was acquired by [[Aalborg Portland]] in 1927.

The '''Lindner family''' is a family that has been prominent in the [[Cincinnati metropolitan area]] since the mid-20th century. They are known for their work in the insurance and investments business. As of 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranks them as the 129th richest family in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/lindner/|title=Lindner family|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known for their involvement in professional sports; [[Carl Lindner Jr.|Carl Jr.]] was a part owner and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Carl Lindner III|Carl III]] is the majority owner and CEO of [[FC Cincinnati]], and the family's contributions to the [[Western &amp; Southern Open]] led to its venue being titled the [[Lindner Family Tennis Center]].

== History ==
The Lindner family's rise to prominence began with Carl Lindner Sr. opening a dairy processing plant in [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]], Ohio in 1940. The business, [[United Dairy Farmers]], had expanded to thirty stores by 1960, and the family bought the [[American Financial Group]] with their savings. By the mid-1960s, Carl Sr.'s sons were running the family's businesses: [[Carl Lindner Jr.|Carl Jr.]] was running American Financial Group and Richard was running United Dairy Farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/lindner-milk-money-fortune-500/|title=The Lindner Family: From Milk Money to The Fortune 500|last=Murtha|first=Lisa|date=October 30, 2014|work=[[Cincinnati (magazine)|Cincinnati]]|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the Lindner family founded and funded the [[Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy]].

In 1999, Carl Jr. bought controlling ownership in the [[Cincinnati Reds]], which he held until selling to [[Robert Castellini]] in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3702">'''Lo Man-wai''' (1895 – 5 April 1985) was a prominent lawyer and politician in Hong Kong. He was member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

==Biography==
He was the son of the wealthy Hong Kong merchant and [[compradore]] of the [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]], [[Lo Cheung-shiu]]. His brother, [[Lo Man-kam]] was also a prominent lawyer and member of the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong before Lo Man-wai. He had three sons and one daughters. His second son, [[Kenneth Lo Tak-cheung]], was also member of the [[Urban Council]].&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠殯禮榮衷|date=12 April 1985|page=10|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo was born in 1895 and educated in Hong Kong before he studied law in England. After he returned to Hong Kong in 1916, he practiced law at his family's law firm.&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠殯禮十一日舉行|date=8 April 1985|page=8|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1926 and became member of the Urban Council in 1940. After the war, he succeeded his brother, Lo Man-kam to become member of the Legislative Council in 1950 and of the Executive Council in 1959. For his service in the Legislative Council, he was awarded the Officer and the Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1950 and 1955 respectively.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

He was also director of many major public companies, including the [[Hongkong Tramways]], [[Star Ferry]], [[China Light and Power Company]], [[Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company]], and [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=羅文惠前日逝世|date=7 April 1985|page=5|newspaper=Tai Kung Pao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo was also a good tennis player and was regarded as the "Grand Old Man of Hong Kong Tennis." He won win the Men's Doubles with his brother Lo Man-kam at the 1920 Hong Kong National Grass Court Championships, as well as the singles title in 1929. In addition, he finished as runner-up to Ng Sze-kwong three years in a row in the Men's Singles at the Hong Kong National Grass Court Championships from 1920 to 1922. With his sister Enid Lo, he also won the Mixed Doubles of the Hong Kong Hardcourt Championships in 1928, 1930 and 1932, thus elevating him to the status as the only Hong Kong player to have won a local major doubles title with both his brother and his sister.

Lo died on 5 April 1985. His funeral took place at the Hong Kong Funeral Home and his body was cremated at the Cape Collinson Crematorium on 11 April.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funeral"/&gt;

'''Marketing management''' is the process of developing strategies and planning for product or services, advertising, promotions, sales to reach desired customer segment.

== Structure ==
Marketing management employs tools from [[economics]] and [[competitive strategy]] to analyze the industry context in which the firm operates.  These include [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter's five forces]], analysis of [[strategic group]]s of competitors, [[value chain]] analysis and others.&lt;ref name="PorterCS"&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 1998
  | isbn = 0-684-84148-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using [[SWOT analysis]].  Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] and [[product differentiation]], degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often conduct [[market research]] and [[marketing research]] to perform marketing analysis.  Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* [[Qualitative marketing research]], such as [[focus groups]] and various types of interviews
* [[Quantitative marketing research]], such as [[statistical survey]]s
* [[Experimental techniques]] such as [[test market]]s
* [[Observational techniques]] such as [[ethnography|ethnographic]] (on-site) observation

Marketing managers may also design and oversee various [[environmental scanning]] and [[competitive intelligence]] processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

===Brand audit===
A [[brand]] [[audit]] is a thorough examination of a brand's current position in an industry compared to its competitors and the examination of its effectiveness.  When it comes to brand auditing, six questions should be carefully examined and assessed:
#how well the business’ current brand strategy is working, 
#what the company's established resource strengths and weaknesses are,
#what its external opportunities and threats are,
#how competitive the business’ prices and costs are,
#how strong the business’ competitive position in comparison to its competitors is, and
#what strategic issues are facing the business.

When a business is conducting a brand audit, the goal is to uncover business’ resource strengths, deficiencies, best market opportunities, outside threats, future profitability, and its competitive standing in comparison to existing competitors.  A brand audit establishes the strategic elements needed to improve brand position and competitive capabilities within the industry.  Once a brand is audited, any business that ends up with a strong financial performance and market position is more likely than not to have a properly conceived and effectively executed brand strategy.

A brand audit examines whether a business’ share of the market is increasing, decreasing, or stable.  It determines if the company’s margin of profit is improving, decreasing, and how much it is in comparison to the [[profit margin]] of established competitors.  Additionally, a brand audit investigates trends in a business’ net profits, the return on existing investments, and its established economic value.  It determines whether or not the business’ entire financial strength and credit rating is improving or getting worse.  This kind of audit also assesses a business’ image and reputation with its customers.  Furthermore, a brand audit seeks to determine whether or not a business is [[perceived]] as an industry leader in technology, offering product or service innovations, along with exceptional customer service, among other relevant issues that customers use to decide on a brand of preference.

A brand audit usually focuses on a business’ strengths and resource capabilities because these are the elements that enhance its competitiveness.  A business’ competitive strengths can exist in several forms.  Some of these forms include skilled or pertinent expertise, valuable physical assets, valuable human assets, valuable organizational assets, valuable intangible assets, competitive capabilities, achievements and attributes that position the business into a competitive advantage, and alliances or cooperative ventures.

The basic concept of a brand audit is to determine whether a business’ resource strengths are competitive assets or competitive liabilities.  This type of  audit seeks to ensure that a business maintains a distinctive competence that allows it to build and reinforce its competitive advantage.  What’s more, a successful brand audit seeks to establish what a business capitalizes on best, its level of expertise, resource strengths, and strongest competitive capabilities, while aiming to identify a business’ position and future performance.

=== Marketing strategy ===
{{Main|Marketing strategy}}
Two customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions:
# The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and
# The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment's business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably.&lt;ref name="Clancy&amp;Krieg"/&gt;
A commonly cited definition of marketing is simply "meeting needs profitably".&lt;ref name="KotlerMM"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Kotler
  | first = Philip.
  | authorlink = Philip Kotler
  |author2=[[Kevin Lane Keller]] 
  | title = Marketing Management, 12th ed.
  | publisher = [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]
  | year = 2006
  | isbn = 0-13-145757-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segment(s) than it will for other, non-targeted customers.  In some cases, the firm may go so far as to turn away customers who are not in its target segment.The doorman at a swanky nightclub, for example, may deny entry to unfashionably dressed individuals because the business has made a strategic decision to target the "high fashion" segment of nightclub patrons.

In conjunction with targeting decisions, marketing managers will identify the desired [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] they want the company, product, or brand to occupy in the target customer's mind.  This positioning is often an encapsulation of a key benefit the company's product or service offers that is [[Product differentiation|differentiated]] and superior to the benefits offered by competitive products.&lt;ref name="Ries&amp;Trout"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Ries
  | first = Al
  |author2=[[Jack Trout]] 
  | title = Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind (20th anniversary ed.)
  | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-07-135916-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] has traditionally positioned its products in the [[automobile]] market in North America in order to be perceived as the leader in "safety", whereas [[BMW]] has traditionally positioned its brand to be perceived as the leader in "performance".

Ideally, a firm's positioning can be maintained over a long period of time because the company possesses, or can develop, some form of [[sustainable competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name="PorterCA"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Porter
  | first = Michael
  | title = Competitive Advantage (revised ed.)
  | publisher = [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]]
  | year = 1998
  | isbn = 0-684-84146-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positioning should also be sufficiently relevant to the target segment such that it will drive the purchasing behavior of target customers.&lt;ref name="Ries&amp;Trout"/&gt;
To sum up,the marketing branch of a company is to deal with the selling and popularity of its products among people and its customers,as the central and eventual goal of a company is customer satisfaction and the return of revenue.

=== Implementation planning ===
{{Main|Marketing plan}}
[[Image:Marketing Metrics Continuum.svg|thumb|300px|The Marketing Metrics Continuum provides a framework for how to categorize metrics from the tactical to strategic.]]
If the company has obtained an adequate understanding of the customer base and its own competitive position in the industry, marketing managers are able to make their own key strategic decisions and develop a [[marketing strategy]] designed to maximize the [[revenue]]s and [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the firm.  The selected strategy may aim for any of a variety of specific objectives, including optimizing short-term unit margins, revenue growth, [[market share]], long-term profitability, or other goals.

After the firm's strategic objectives have been identified, the target market selected, and the desired positioning for the company, product or brand has been determined, marketing managers focus on how to best implement the chosen strategy.  Traditionally, this has involved implementation planning across the "4 Ps" of : [[product management]], pricing (at what price slot does a producer position a product, e.g. low, medium or high price), place (the place or area where the products are going to be sold, which could be local, regional, countrywide or international) (i.e. sales and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] channels), and Promotion.

Taken together, the company's implementation choices across the 4 Ps are often described as the [[marketing mix]], meaning the mix of elements the business will employ to "[[go to market]]" and execute the marketing strategy.  The overall goal for the marketing mix is to consistently deliver a compelling [[value proposition]] that reinforces the firm's chosen positioning, builds [[customer loyalty]] and [[brand equity]] among target customers, and achieves the firm's marketing and financial objectives.

In many cases, marketing management will develop a [[marketing plan]] to specify how the company will execute the chosen strategy and achieve the business' objectives.  The content of marketing plans varies from firm to firm, but commonly includes:
* An executive summary
* Situation analysis to summarize facts and insights gained from market research and marketing analysis
* The company's mission statement or long-term strategic vision
* A statement of the company's key objectives, often subdivided into marketing objectives and financial objectives
* The marketing strategy the business has chosen, specifying the target segments to be pursued and the competitive positioning to be achieved
* Implementation choices for each element of the marketing mix (the 4 Ps)

=== Project, process, and vendor management ===
More broadly, marketing managers work to design and improve the effectiveness of core marketing [[Business process|processes]], such as [[new product development]], [[brand management]], [[marketing communications]], and pricing.  Marketers may employ the tools of [[business process reengineering]] to ensure these processes are properly designed, and use a variety of [[process management]] techniques to keep them operating smoothly.

Effective execution may require management of both internal resources and a variety of external vendors and service providers, such as the firm's [[advertising agency]].  Marketers may therefore coordinate with the company's Purchasing department on the procurement of these services. Under the area of marketing agency management (i.e. working with external marketing agencies and suppliers) are techniques such as agency performance evaluation, scope of work, incentive compensation, [[RFx]]'s and storage of agency information in a supplier [[database]].

=== Reporting, measurement, feedback and control systems ===
Marketing management employs a variety of metrics to measure progress against objectives.  It is the responsibility of marketing managers to ensure that the execution of marketing programs achieves the desired objectives and does so in a [[cost-efficient]] manner.

Marketing management therefore often makes use of various organizational control systems, such as [[sales forecast]]s, and sales force and reseller [[incentive]] programs, [[sales force management system]]s, and [[customer relationship management]] tools (CRM). Some software vendors have begun using the term ''[[Marketing Operations Management|marketing operations management]]'' or ''[[Marketing Resource Management|marketing resource management]]'' to describe systems that facilitate an integrated approach for controlling marketing resources.  In some cases, these efforts may be linked to various [[supply chain management]] systems, such as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), [[Efficient Consumer Response|efficient consumer response]] (ECR), and [[inventory management]] systems.

=== International marketing management ===
[[Globalization]] has led some firms to market beyond the borders of their home countries, making [[international marketing]] a part of those firms' marketing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2005) ''International Marketing'', [[Oxford University Press]], New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-567123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer demand. In part, this is because the role of a marketing manager (or sometimes called managing marketer in small- and medium-sized enterprises) can vary significantly based on a business's size, [[corporate culture]], and [[industry]] context.  
For example, in a small- and medium-sized enterprises, the managing marketer may contribute in both managerial and marketing operations roles for the company brands. In a large consumer products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall [[general manager]] of his or her assigned product.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P. and Keller, K.L. ''Marketing Management,'' 12th ed., Pearson, 2006, {{ISBN|0-13-145757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To create an effective, cost-efficient marketing management strategy, firms must possess a detailed, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] understanding of their own business and the [[Market (economics)|market]] in which they operate.&lt;ref name="Clancy&amp;Krieg"&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-684-85555-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In analyzing these issues, the discipline of marketing management often overlaps with the related discipline of [[strategic planning]].

In addition to his patents, Middelfart is a pioneer in the use of the [[OODA]] loop process within business intelligence and data warehousing.&lt;ref name=TEC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.technologyevaluation.com/blog/2011/09/19/thinking-radically-dr-morten-middelfart-cto-of-targit/ |title=Thinking Radically: Dr. Morten Middelfart, CTO of TARGIT » The TEC Blog |publisher=Blog.technologyevaluation.com |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process, as first developed by [[USAF]] Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]], describes the way individuals and organizations gather information, decide on a course of action based on that information, and carry out the decision. Middelfart applied this concept to enterprise decision-making and crafted the TARGIT business intelligence software to incorporate the OODA loop's stages. Middelfart was recently named a finalist for a "CIO of the Year" award near his home in Tampa Bay.&lt;ref name=TBWire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaynewswire.com/2013/09/29/tampa-bay-technology-forum-announces-finalists-for-the-10th-annual-industry-achievement-awards-15373|title=Tampa Bay Technology Forum Announces Finalists for the 10th Annual Industry Achievement Awards|work=Tampa Bay News Wire|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middelfart has one patent application pending with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]], focused on the intelligent processing of user queries in natural language into a business intelligence platform.

'''''RollerCoaster Tycoon World''''' is a theme park [[construction and management simulation]] [[video game]] developed by Nvizzio Creations and published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the fourth major installment in the [[RollerCoaster Tycoon (series)|''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' series]]. The game was released on November 16, 2016.

==Gameplay==
Players are able to build rides, shops and roller coasters, while monitoring elements such as budget, visitor happiness and technology research. Unlike ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile]]'', the game does not include any [[micro-transactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/473909/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-coming-to-pc-in-2015/|title=Rollercoaster Tycoon World coming to PC in 2015|publisher=CVG|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'', the game features 3D graphics instead of the 2D isometric style of the first two installments in the series. When building roller coasters, the game makes use of a spline system instead of the old style of laying individual pieces. Players are also allowed to "ride" the roller coasters they have created, and other rides they have placed in their park in the game, in either a first or third person view. A new 'Park Pulse' mechanic was also introduced, allowing players to quickly find out how their park is doing and the customers' thoughts, similar to ''[[Zoo Tycoon (2013 video game)|Zoo Tycoon]]'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-02-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-in-game-screenshots-revealed|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World in-game screenshots revealed|publisher=Eurogamer|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game contains several scenery and ride themes at launch, with more in development that will be released via free updates and paid expansion packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2607109/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preview-the-ride-never-ends.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preview: The ride never ends|author=Hayden Dingman|work=[[PC World]]|date=2014-09-13|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-2/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #2|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206033833/http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-2/|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also introduces an "Architect mode", allowing players to plan and layout the coaster's model before constructing the coasters. Similar to the past installments, there are four different types of coasters available to build: [[Steel roller coaster|steel]], [[Inverted roller coaster|inverted]], [[Wooden roller coaster|wooden]], and [[Launch track|launch-track]] coasters. In addition, there are ten roller coasters per type. 
Coasters can be built freeform or the player can place pre-mode designs into their park.&lt;ref name="DevBlog3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-3/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #3|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207073646/http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog-post-3/|archivedate=7 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike in the previous games, the roller coaster train may fly off the tracks if the roller coaster is built incorrectly. As a result, a new "safety-rating" option and medical staff has been added. User-generated content (including custom scenery) was available from release, as well as Steam Workshop support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.rollercoastertycoon.com/showthread.php?3960-RollerCoaster-Tycoon-World-Production-Blog-13&amp;p=24179&amp;viewfull=1#post24179|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog #13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While terrain and environments are randomly generated in a map, players can still gain access to a terrain editor.&lt;ref name="DevBlog1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-production-blog/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Production Blog Post #1|author=Mattlab|publisher=[[Atari]]|accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
When Atari announced ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile]]'', they also promised that a title for Windows was also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/rollercoaster-tycoon-4-mobile-out-now-pc-version-to-be-introduced-holiday-2014/1100-6418966/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile out now, PC version to be introduced holiday 2014|publisher=Gamespot|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was officially announced during [[Gamescom|Gamescom 2014]] with a teaser trailer, subtitled ''World''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkYDqYcyEU0|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Reveal Trailer|publisher=IGN|date=2014|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first screenshots and details of the game were revealed during [[PAX Prime|PAX Prime 2014]]. Part way through development, Area 52 Games took over as the developer of the game from [[Pipeworks Software]]. The reasoning behind this has not yet been published by Atari, who announced the change along with the relaunch of the RollerCoaster Tycoon website. The game was due for release in early 2015, although it was revealed that they would not announce an official launch date until closer to the release of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/rollercoaster_tycoon_world/news/rollercoaster_tycoon_world_has_a_new_developer.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World has a new developer|author= David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed [[Alpha release|alpha]] was also in development.&lt;ref name="DevBlog1"/&gt; A new trailer showing gameplay was uploaded on March 5, 2015, showing an intro featuring real life POV footage of [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]] and [[Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Colossus]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]].&lt;ref name=gameplay-trailer&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World™ Gameplay Reveal Teaser|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNiIzBM7_w|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Atari, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2015|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari later revealed that a third developer had taken over from Area 52 Games, later confirmed to be Nvizzio Creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/13/roller-coaster-tycoon-world-is-still-in-development-but-its-under-a-new-studio/|title=Roller Coaster Tycoon World is still in development — but it’s under a new studio|last=Grub|first=Jeff|date=May 13, 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[NVIDIA]] booth on [[PAX Prime]] 2015, Atari unveiled interactive gameplay for the game showing off their development build that featured coaster building and sandbox mode. On September 29, 2015, it was announced the release date would be December 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2977645/software-games/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preview-a-wildly-easy-to-get-into-ride.html|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preview: A wild(ly easy to get into) ride|date=2015-08-30|author=Hayden Dingman|work=[[PC World]]|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sys-con.com/node/3421930|title=Atari® Rides into PAX Prime 2015, Unveils RollerCoaster Tycoon World™|date=2015-08-20|author=Pr Newswire|accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two beta weekends  preceded the release of the game. The first beta weekend was the last weekend of October and this beta was focused on the new spline-based Coaster Builder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/buy/|title=Buy - RollerCoaster Tycoon World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first beta weekend took place as planned.  However, feedback from this beta weekend led to Atari deciding to delay the game's release to early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/rctw-blog-23-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-releasing-in-early-2016/|title=RCTW – Blog #23 – RollerCoaster Tycoon World Releasing in Early 2016 {{!}} RollerCoaster Tycoon World|website=www.rollercoastertycoon.com|accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The developer noted the additional development time would allow them to add requested items and features such as “predefined piece” coaster building, additional coaster test feedback, a robust fencing tool, improved on-demand grid, and various smaller improvements."  Consequently, the second beta weekend was also delayed from November to December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-delayed-following-first/1100-6432283/ |title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Delayed Following First Beta |last=Pereira |first=Chris |date=2015-11-13 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[Atari]] had decided that its theme park game, ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'', would be launched into Early Access on 30 March, instead of going with a full release. The early access release was met with negative reviews, mostly complaining about the poor graphics, coaster builder, lack of detail, and ride animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2016-25-03-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-coming-to-steam-early-access-on-march-30th|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World coming to Steam Early Access on March 30th|last=Falcon|first=Jonah|publisher=GameWatcher|date=March 25, 2016|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Atari announced that the game will be released on November 16, 2016, one day before ''[[Planet Coaster]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World release date announced, and it's one day before Planet Coaster's launch|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-release-date-announced-and-its-one-day-before-planet-coasters-launch/|accessdate=11 November 2016|work=pcgamer|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was available for both standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition contained two additional maps, terrain texture additions, a digital art book, a gold park entrance, and the panda mascot from the previous games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World preorders now available at Steam &amp; GMG|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/09/29/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-preorders-now-available-at-steam-gmg/|website=Venture Beat|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World™: Deluxe Edition|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/405580/|website=Steam|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-release ===
A trailer released by Atari containing gameplay of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'' was received poorly by critics and fans.&lt;ref name="KotakuTrailerCriticism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/new-rollercoaster-tycoon-game-looks-like-shit-1689731858|title=New ''RollerCoaster Tycoon'' Game Looks Like Shit|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/831009-rollercoaster-tycoon-worlds-gameplay-trailer-tragically-bad|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World’s Gameplay Trailer is Tragically Bad|last=Leack|first=Jonathan|date=March 5, 2015|publisher=Crave Online|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamesided.com/2015/03/05/rollercoaster-tycoon-world-gameplay-trailer-something/|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon World Gameplay Trailer Is...

They also promised that the new visuals would be of higher definition and higher level of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/21/8270517/rollercoaster-tycoon-promises-graphics-overhaul-after-gameplay|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon promises graphics overhaul after gameplay trailer raises complaints|date=2015-03-21|author=Owen S.

=== Release ===
The release of ''RollerCoaster Tycoon World'' was met with negative reactions by critics. According to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], the game holds a score of 43 out of 100, based on seven reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaCritic"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]'' suggested to avoid the game, comparing the game to a "car-crash into an orphanage for bush-babies."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

TechRaptor rated the game a 1/10, citing the large interface and variety of bugs and glitches within the game.&lt;ref name="TechRaptor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blouin|first1=Alec|title=Roller Coaster Tycoon World Review – How to Destroy a Franchise|url=https://techraptor.net/content/roller-coaster-tycoon-world-destroy-franchise|website=TechRaptor|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sid Meier's Railroads'''''  is a [[business simulation game]] developed by [[Sid Meier]] on the [[Gamebryo]] game engine that was released in October [[2006 in video games|2006]] and is the sequel to ''[[Railroad Tycoon 3]]''. Although Sid Meier created the original ''[[Railroad Tycoon (series)|Railroad Tycoon]]'', subsequent versions were developed by [[PopTop Software]]. After a visit to [[Miniatur Wunderland]] in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], [[Germany]], Sid Meier was inspired to reinvent his original creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JjVsBQVK2A | title=Interview with Sid Meier | format=Video | publisher=[[YouTube]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for the [[Mac OS|Mac]] [[OS X]] was published by [[Feral Interactive]] on November 1, 2012, under the latter's Feral Legends label.&lt;ref name="feralinteractive.com"/&gt;

==Overview==
''Railroads!'' is fully [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] and geared more toward head-to-head [[real-time strategy]] than the previous versions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firaxis.com/?/about | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[Firaxis Games]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in it being less suited to single player play, and a less realistic simulation of railway operation.  The terrain is more compressed in this game; there are few areas where players are allowed a long, straight run of track without earthworks or a bridge, meaning that terrain (such as hills, mountains, rivers and inlets) plays a more important role, at least in the early stages of a game.

The game is heavily focused on [[economics]] – players have to build and sustain entire [[industries]] using the railroads they develop. Gameplay changes from previous editions of ''Railroad Tycoon'' include a system where new technology is first [[auction]]ed to the highest bidder.  This gives the player a ten-year exclusive use of that technology. Similarly, individual industries are also put up for auction amongst players.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/sid-meiers-railroads/ | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=2006 | accessdate=2015-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game does not have the dynamic pricing of goods across the entire map or cargo that can find alternate means of transportation if no train service is provided that were features of Railroad Tycoon III, and other simplifications compared to previous Railroad Tycoon games are that there is no separation of individual money from company money, nor the ability to raise money on an in-game bond market.   Tracklaying is automated and much easier than other editions of ''Railroad Tycoon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/724/724674p1.html | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=IGN | year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the more "compressed" terrain, it allows for tactical placement of track to obstruct and frustrate opponents.  However, players are limited to laying track in a contiguous system, which in turn reduces the impact of there being no network effects in the economics of the game.  Another limitation is that trains do not keep to the right on a stretch of double track, meaning unrealistic blocking of the track by one's own trains is common if more than one train is allowed on a stretch of track.

Industries vary depending on the location and timeframe. European scenarios include Wine, Beer, and Dairy Products while Western United States scenarios focus on [[Petroleum|Oil]] and Gold.

The game also allows head-to-head play over a [[Local Area Network|LAN]], and prior to 2013 when GameSpy ceased online hosting services for multiplayer games, the [[Internet]], supporting up to four players per game, either human or [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="gameinformer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2E1C4B8D-B401-4B7E-998B-9E8F6388B54F.htm | title=Sid Meier's Railroads! | publisher=[[Game Informer]] | date=2006 | accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018173510/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2E1C4B8D-B401-4B7E-998B-9E8F6388B54F.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenarios==

Like the previous versions, ''Railroads!'' offers various historical scenarios, in regions such as the [[Southwestern United States]], the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. In these scenarios (fifteen in all), the game allows the user to take on the role of various famous railway tycoons and [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]] from the past, such as [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] and [[J.P. Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sidmeiersrailroads.com/ | title=Full Barons List | format=Flash | publisher=[[2K Games]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custom scenarios==
With the introduction of patch 1.1 a map editor could be enabled by editing one of the game's [[.ini]] files,&lt;ref name="2kgames.com"&gt;[http://www.2kgames.com/index.php?p=support&amp;product=245%2C3%2CSid+Meier%27s+Railroads%21%2CPC%2C2K_Games%2Crailroads&amp;section=patches Sid Meier's Railroads!

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}

'''Synergy''' is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts.  The term ''synergy'' comes from the [[Attic Greek]] word συνεργία ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergia}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=synergy "synergy"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; from ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergos}}'', {{lang|el|[[wikt:συνεργός|συνεργός]]}}, meaning "working together".

==History==
The words "synergy" and "synergetic" have been used in the field of [[physiology]] since at least the middle of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
SYN'ERGY, ''Synergi'a'', ''Synenergi'a'', (F.) ''Synergie''; from ''συν'', 'with,' and ''εργον'', 'work.' A correlation or concourse of action between different organs in health; and, according to some, in disease.
:—Dunglison, Robley [https://books.google.com/books?id=jAm6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA835 ''Medical Lexicon''] Blanchard and Lea, 1853
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1896, [[:fr:Henri Mazel|Henri Mazel]] applied the term "synergy" to social psychology by writing ''La synergie sociale'', in which he argued that Darwinian theory failed to account for "social synergy" or "social love", a collective evolutionary drive. The highest civilizations were the work not only of the elite but of the masses too; those masses must be led, however, because the crowd, a feminine and unconscious force, cannot distinguish between good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Werth, Margaret [https://books.google.com/books?id=-gDaqOcUMhgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22social+synergy%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20synergy%22 ''The Joy of Life: The Idyllic in French Art'', circa 1900] University of California Press, 2002, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Lester Frank Ward]] defined synergy as the universal constructive principle of nature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have characterized the social struggle as centrifugal and social solidarity as centripetal. Either alone is productive of evil consequences. Struggle is essentially destructive of the social order, while communism removes individual initiative. The one leads to disorder, the other to degeneracy. What is not seen—the truth that has no expounders—is that the wholesome, constructive movement consists in the properly ordered combination and interaction of both these principles. This is ''social synergy'', which is a form of cosmic synergy, the universal constructive principle of nature.
:—Ward, Lester F. [https://archive.org/stream/glimpsescosmos00wardgoog#page/n405/mode/1up/search/synergy ''Glimpses of the Cosmos'', volume VI (1897–1912)] G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1918, p. 358
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Descriptions and usages==
In the natural world, synergistic phenomena are ubiquitous, ranging from physics (for example, the different combinations of quarks that produce protons and neutrons) to chemistry (a popular example is water, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen), to the cooperative interactions among the genes in genomes, the division of labor in bacterial colonies, the synergies of scale in multi-cellular organisms, as well as the many different kinds of synergies produced by socially-organized groups, from honeybee colonies to wolf packs and human societies: compare [[stigmergy]], a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions that results in the [[self-assembly]] of [[complex system]]s. Even the tools and technologies that are widespread in the natural world represent important sources of synergistic effects. The tools that enabled early [[hominin]]s to become systematic big-game hunters is a primordial human example.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, ''Nature's Magic: Synergy in Evolution and the Fate of Humankind'', New York: Cambridge University Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-82547-4}}; Peter A. Corning, ''Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bioeconomics of Evolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the context of organizational behavior, following the view that a cohesive group is more than the sum of its parts, synergy is the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. These conclusions are derived from the studies conducted by Jay Hall on a number of laboratory-based group ranking and prediction tasks. He found that effective groups actively looked for the points in which they disagreed and in consequence encouraged conflicts amongst the participants in the early stages of the discussion. In contrast, the ineffective groups felt a need to establish a common view quickly, used simple decision making methods such as averaging, and focused on completing the task rather than on finding solutions they could agree on.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 276, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a technical context, its meaning is a construct or collection of different elements working together to produce results not obtainable by any of the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, documents: all things required to produce system-level results. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is created primarily by the relationship among the parts, that is, how they are interconnected. In essence, a system constitutes a set of interrelated components working together with a common objective: fulfilling some designated need.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Blanchard, System Engineering Management, pp 8, John Wiley 2004, {{ISBN|0-471-29176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If used in a business application, synergy means that teamwork will produce an overall better result than if each person within the group were working toward the same goal individually. However, the concept of group [[cohesion (social policy)|cohesion]] needs to be considered. Group cohesion is that property that is inferred from the number and strength of mutual positive attitudes among members of the group. As the group becomes more cohesive, its functioning is affected in a number of ways. First, the interactions and communication between members increase. Common goals, interests and small size all contribute to this. In addition, group member satisfaction increases as the group provides friendship and support against outside threats.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text, Prentice Hall, pp 275, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are negative aspects of group cohesion that have an effect on group decision-making and hence on group effectiveness. There are two issues arising. The [[risky shift]] phenomenon is the tendency of a group to make decisions that are riskier than those that the group would have recommended individually. Group [[Polarization (politics)|Polarisation]] is when individuals in a group begin by taking a moderate stance on an issue regarding a common value and, after having discussed it, end up taking a more extreme stance.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchannan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 280, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, potential negative consequence of group cohesion is group think. Group think is a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in cohesive group, when the members' striving for unanimity overrides their motivation to appraise realistically the alternative courses of action. Studying the events of several American policy "disasters" such as the failure to anticipate the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (1941) and the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco (1961), Irving Janis argued that they were due to the cohesive nature of the committees that made the relevant decisions.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 283, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That decisions made by committees lead to failure in a simple system is noted by Dr. Chris Elliot. His case study looked at [[IEEE-488]], an international standard set by the leading US standards body; it led to a failure of small automation systems using the IEEE-488 standard (which codified a proprietary communications standard [[HP-IB]]). But the external devices used for communication were made by two different companies, and the incompatibility between the external devices led to a financial loss for the company. He argues that systems will be safe only if they are designed, not if they emerge by chance.&lt;ref&gt;:Dr Chris Elliot, System safety and Law, Proceedings of First International Conference on System Safety, Institution of Engineering and Technology, London,  pp 344-351(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The idea of a systemic approach is endorsed by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Health and Safety Executive]]. The successful performance of the health and safety management depends upon the analyzing the causes of incidents and accidents and learning correct lessons from them. The idea is that all events (not just those causing injuries) represent failures in control, and present an opportunity for learning and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'', {{ISBN|978-0-7176-1276-5}},(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'' (1997): this book describes the principles and management practices, which provide the basis of effective health and safety management. It sets out the issues that need to be addressed, and can be used for developing improvement programs, self-audit, or self-assessment. Its message is that organizations must manage health and safety with the same degree of expertise and to the same standards as other core business activities, if they are to effectively control risks and prevent harm to people.

The term synergy was refined by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who analyzed some of its implications more fully&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s01/p0100.html SYNERGETICS Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking by R. Buckminster Fuller (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt; and coined the term [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. B., (1975), ''Synergetics: Explorations In The Geometry Of Thinking'', in collaboration with E. J. Applewhite. Introduction and contribution by Arthur L. Loeb. Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A dynamic state in which combined action is favored over the difference of individual component actions.
* Behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the behavior of their parts taken separately, known as [[emergent behavior]].
* The cooperative action of two or more stimuli (or drugs), resulting in a different or greater response than that of the individual stimuli.

==Biological sciences==
Synergy of various kinds has been advanced by [[Peter Corning]] as a causal agency that can explain the progressive evolution of complexity in living systems over the course of time. According to the Synergism Hypothesis, synergistic effects have been the drivers of cooperative relationships of all kinds and at all levels in living systems. The thesis, in a nutshell, is that synergistic effects have often provided functional advantages (economic benefits) in relation to survival and reproduction that have been favored by natural selection.  The cooperating parts, elements, or individuals become, in effect, functional “units” of selection in evolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, The Synergism Hypothesis: A Theory of Progressive Evolution, New York, McGraw Hill 1983 {{ISBN|0-07-013166-X}}; Peter A. Corning, Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bio economics of Evolution, Chicago, University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}};[http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf Synergy and self-organization in the evolution of complex systems.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103635/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, environmental systems may react in a non-linear way to perturbations, such as climate change, so that the outcome may be greater than the sum of the individual component alterations. Synergistic responses are a complicating factor in environmental modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N ''Environmental Unknowns'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest synergy===
Pest synergy would occur in a [[biology|biological]] [[Host (biology)|host]] [[organism]] population, where, for example, the introduction of [[parasite]] A may cause 10% fatalities, and parasite B may also cause 10% loss. When both parasites are present, the losses would normally be expected to total less than 20%, yet, in some cases, losses are significantly greater. In such cases, it is said that the parasites in combination have a synergistic effect.

=== Drug synergy ===
Mechanisms that may be involved in the development of synergistic effects include:
*Effect on the same cellular system (e.g. two different [[antibiotics]] like a [[penicillin]] and an [[aminoglycoside]]; penicillins damage the cell wall of gram-positive [[bacteria]] and improve the penetration of aminoglycosides).&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 698.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prevention or delay of degradation in the body (e.g. the antibiotic [[Ciprofloxacin]] inhibits the metabolism of [[Theophylline]]).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 931.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Slowdown of excretion (e.g. [[Probenecid]] delays the [[renal]] excretion of Penicillin and thus prolongs its effect).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"/&gt;
*Anticounteractive action: for example, the effect of [[oxaliplatin]] and [[irinotecan]]. Oxaliplatin [[wikt:intercalation|intercalates]] DNA, thereby preventing the cell from replicating DNA. Irinotecan inhibits [[topoisomerase 1]], consequently the cytostatic effect is increased.&lt;ref name="Jia2009"&gt;Jia Jia et al: "Mechanisms of drug combinations: interaction and network perspectives." Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 8, 111-130, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Effect on the same receptor but different sites (e.g. the coadministration of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, both act by enhancing the action of GABA on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, but benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel opening, whilst barbiturates increase the channel closing time, making these two drugs dramatically enhance GABAergic neurotransmission).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

More mechanisms are described in an exhaustive 2009 review.&lt;ref name="Jia2009"/&gt;

===Toxicological synergy===
Toxicological synergy is of concern to the public and regulatory agencies because chemicals individually considered safe might pose unacceptable health or ecological risk in combination. Articles in scientific and lay journals include many definitions of chemical or toxicological synergy, often vague or in conflict with each other. Because toxic interactions are defined relative to the expectation under "no interaction", a determination of synergy (or antagonism) depends on what is meant by "no interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, R. C., and MacDonell, M. M. (2002). Synergy and other ineffective mixture risk definitions. Sci Total Environ 288, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has one of the more detailed and precise definitions of toxic interaction, designed to facilitate risk assessment.&lt;ref name="EPAMixRisk"&gt;[http://ofmpub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=4486], U.S. EPA (2000). Supplementary Guidance for Conducting Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures. Risk Assessment Forum, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; In their guidance documents, the no-interaction default assumption is dose addition, so synergy means a mixture response that exceeds that predicted from dose addition. The EPA emphasizes that synergy does not always make a mixture dangerous, nor does antagonism always make the mixture safe; each depends on the predicted risk under dose addition.

For example, a consequence of pesticide use is the risk of health effects. During the registration of [[pesticide]]s in the [[United States]] exhaustive tests are performed to discern health effects on humans at various exposure levels. A regulatory upper limit of presence in foods is then placed on this pesticide. As long as residues in the food stay below this regulatory level, health effects are deemed highly unlikely and the food is considered safe to consume.

However, in normal agricultural practice, it is rare to use only a single pesticide. During the production of a crop, several different materials may be used. Each of them has had determined a regulatory level at which they would be considered individually safe. In many cases, a commercial pesticide is itself a combination of several chemical agents, and thus the safe levels actually represent levels of the mixture. In contrast, a combination created by the end user, such as a farmer, has rarely been tested in that combination. The potential for synergy is then unknown or estimated from data on similar combinations.  This lack of information also applies to many of the chemical combinations to which humans are exposed, including residues in food, indoor air contaminants, and occupational exposures to chemicals. Some groups think that the rising rates of cancer, asthma, and other health problems may be caused by these combination exposures; others have alternative explanations. This question will likely be answered only after years of exposure by the population in general and research on chemical toxicity, usually performed on animals. Examples of pesticide synergists include [[Piperonyl butoxide]] and [[MGK 264]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reevaluation/pyrethroids-pyrethrins.html Pyrethroids and Pyrethrins], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, epa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human synergy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Human synergy relates to  human interaction and teamwork. For example, say person A alone is too short to reach an [[apple]] on a [[tree]] and person B is too short as well. Once person B sits on the [[shoulder]]s of person A, they are tall enough to reach the apple. In this example, the product of their synergy would be one apple. Another case would be two [[politician]]s. If each is able to gather one million votes on their own, but together they were able to appeal to 2.5 million voters, their synergy would have produced 500,000 more votes than had they each worked independently. A [[song]] is also a good example of human synergy, taking more than one musical part and putting them together to create a song that has a much more dramatic effect than each of the parts when played individually.

A third form of human synergy is when one person is able to complete two separate tasks by doing one action, for example, if a person were asked by a [[teacher]] and his [[supervisor|boss]] at work to write an [[essay]] on how he could improve his work.  A more visual example of this synergy is a [[drummer]] using four separate [[rhythm]]s to create one [[drum]] beat.

Synergy usually arises when two persons with different complementary skills cooperate.  In business, cooperation of people with organizational and technical skills happens very often. In general, the most common reason why people cooperate is that it brings a synergy. On the other hand, people tend to specialize just to be able to form groups with high synergy (see also [[division of labor]] and [[teamwork]]).

Example: Two teams in System Administration working together to combine technical and organizational skills in order to better the client experience, thus creating synergy. Counter-examples can be found in books like [[The Mythical Man-Month]], in which the addition of additional team members is shown to have negative effects on productivity.

[[Organismic computing]] is an approach to improving group efficacy by increasing synergy in human groups via technological means.

When synergy occurs in the work place, the individuals involved get to work in a positive and supportive working environment.  When individuals get to work in environments such as these, the company reaps the benefits.  The authors of ''Creating the Best Workplace on Earth'' Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones, state that "highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations that the least-engaged workers.  And companies with highly engaged people outperform firms with the most disengaged folks- by 54% in employee retention, by 89% in customer satisfaction, and by fourfold in revenue growth (Goffee &amp; Jones, pg. 100)."  Also, those that are able to be open about their views on the company, and have confidence that they will be heard, are likely to be a more organized employee who helps his/ her fellow team members succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Goffee, R. &amp; Jones, G.  (2013).  Creating the best workplace on the earth.  Harvard Business Review, 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate synergy==
{{main|corporate synergy}}
[[Corporate synergy]] occurs when corporations interact congruently.  A corporate synergy refers to a financial benefit that a corporation
expects to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation.  This type of synergy is a nearly ubiquitous feature of a corporate acquisition and is a negotiating point between the buyer and seller that impacts the final price both parties agree to. There are distinct types of corporate synergies, as follows.

===Marketing===
A marketing synergy refers to the use of information campaigns, studies, and scientific discovery or experimentation for research or development. This promotes the sale of products for varied use or off-market sales as well as development of marketing tools and in several cases exaggeration of effects. It is also often a meaningless buzzword used by corporate leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Synergy Myth: And Other Ailments Of Business Today |edition= |first1=Harold |last1=Geneen |first2=Brent |last2=Bowers |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-312-14724-2 |page=xii |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=3nNwQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Political Correctness: Social Transformation in the United States |edition= |first1=Michael S. |last1=Cummings |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58826-006-2 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC&amp;pg=PA92 Extract of page 92]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
A revenue synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to generate more revenue than its two predecessor stand-alone companies would be able to generate. For example, if company A sells product X through its sales force, company B sells product Y, and company A decides to buy company B then the new company could use each sales person to sell products X and Y, thereby increasing the revenue that each sales person generates for the company.

In media revenue, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate, e.g. films, soundtracks, or video games.

===Financial===
Financial synergy gained by the combined firm is a result of number of benefits which flow to the entity as a consequence of acquisition and merger. These benefits may be:

====Cash slack====
This is when a firm having number of cash extensive projects acquires a firm which is cash-rich, thus enabling the new combined firm to enjoy the profits from investing the cash of one firm in the projects of the other.

====Debt capacity====
If two firms have no or little capacity to carry debt before individually, it is possible for them to join and gain the capacity to carry the debt through decreased gearing (leverage).  This creates value for the firm, as debt is thought to be a cheaper source of finance.

====Tax benefits====
It is possible for one firm to have unused tax benefits which might be offset against the profits of another after combination, thus resulting in less tax being paid. However this greatly depends on the tax law of the country.

===Management===
Synergy in management and in relation to teamwork refers to the combined effort of individuals as participants of the team.&lt;ref name="law2003"&gt;Lawford, G. R. (2003). Beyond success: Achieving synergy in teamwork. ''The Journal for Quality and Participation'', 26(3), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition that exists when the organization's parts interact to produce a joint effect that is greater than the sum of the parts acting alone. Positive or negative synergies can exist. In these cases, positive synergy has positive effects such as improved efficiency in operations, greater exploitation of opportunities, and improved utilization of resources. Negative synergy on the other hand has negative effects such as: reduced efficiency of operations, decrease in quality, underutilization of resources and disequilibrium with the external environment.

===Cost===
A cost synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to reduce or eliminate expenses associated with running a business. Cost synergies are realized by eliminating positions that are viewed as duplicate within the merged entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costsynergy.asp Cost Synergy, ''investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the headquarters office of one of the predecessor companies, certain executives, the human resources department, or other employees of the predecessor companies. This is related to the economic concept of [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]].

==Synergistic action in economy==
The synergistic action of the economic players lies within the economic phenomenon's profundity. The synergistic action gives different dimensions to competitiveness, strategy and network identity becoming an unconventional "weapon" which belongs to those who exploit the economic systems’ potential in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergistic determinants===
The synergistic gravity equation (SYNGEq), according to its complex “title”, represents a synthesis of the endogenous and exogenous factors which determine the private and non-private economic decision makers to call to actions of synergistic exploitation of the economic network in which they operate. That is to say, SYNGEq constitutes a big picture of the factors/motivations which determine the entrepreneurs to contour an active synergistic network. SYNGEq includes both factors which character is changing over time (such as the competitive conditions), as well as classics factors, such as the imperative of the access to resources of the collaboration and the quick answers. The synergistic gravity equation (SINGEq) comes to be represented by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 33 and 37&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;∑SYN.Act = ∑R-*I(CRed+COOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;+A&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt;)*V(Cust.+Info.)*cc&lt;/center&gt;

where:
*∑SYN.Act = the sum of the synergistic actions adopted (by the economic actor)
*∑ R- = the amount of unpurchased but necessary resources
*ICRed = the imperative for cost reductions
*ICOOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt; = the imperative for deep cooperation (functional interdependence)
*IA&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt; = the imperative for purchasing unimitable competitive advantages (for the economic actor)
*VCust = the necessity of customer value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages VInfo = the necessity of informational value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages
*cc = the specific competitive conditions in which the economic actor operates

===Synergistic networks and systems===
The synergistic network represents an integrated part of the economic system which, through the coordination and control functions (of the undertaken economic actions), agrees synergies. The networks which promote synergistic actions can be divided in horizontal synergistic networks and vertical synergistic networks.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergy effects===
The synergy effects are difficult (even impossible) to imitate by competitors and difficult to reproduce by their authors because these effects depend on the combination of factors with time-varying characteristics. The synergy effects are often called "synergistic benefits", representing the direct and implied result of the developed/adopted synergistic actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers==
Synergy can also be defined as the combination of human strengths and computer strengths, such as [[advanced chess]]. Computers can process data much more quickly than humans, but lack the ability to respond meaningfully to arbitrary stimuli.

==Synergy in literature==
Etymologically, the "synergy" term was first used around 1600, deriving from the Greek word “synergos”, which means “to work together” or “to cooperate”. If during this period the synergy concept was mainly used in the theological field (describing “the cooperation of human effort with divine will”), in the 19th and 20th centuries, "synergy" was promoted in physics and biochemistry, being implemented in the study of the open economic systems only in the 1960 and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote an essay titled ''On Fairy Stores'', delivered at an Andrew Lang Lecture, and reprinted in his book, ''The Tolkien Reader'', published in 1966. In it, he made two references to synergy, although he did not use that term. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Faerie cannot be caught in a net of words; for it is one of its qualities to be indescribable, though not imperceptible. It has many ingredients, but analysis will not necessarily discover the secret of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more succinctly, in a footnote, about the "part of producing the web of an intricate story", he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is indeed easier to unravel a single ''thread'' &amp;mdash; an incident, a name, a motive &amp;mdash; than to trace the history of any ''picture'' defined by many threads. For with the picture in the tapestry a new element has come in: the picture is greater than, and not explained by, the sum of the component threads.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synergy in the media==

The informational synergies which can be applied also in media involve a compression of transmission, access and use of information’s time, the flows, circuits and means of handling information being based on a complementary, integrated, transparent and coordinated use of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In media economics, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product (and all its versions) throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture 5: an Introduction to Mass Communication. Fifth Edition 2007 Update ed. Bostin: Bedford St. Martins, 2007. 606.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. films, soundtracks or video games. [[Walt Disney]] pioneered synergistic marketing techniques in the 1930s by granting dozens of firms the right to use his [[Mickey Mouse]] character in products and ads, and continued to market Disney media through licensing arrangements. These products can help advertise the film itself and thus help to increase the film's sales. For example, the [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man films]] had toys of webshooters and figures of the characters made, as well as posters and games.&lt;ref&gt;Media Synergy see Linden Dalecki's article in Northwestern's ''Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications'' (2008) {{cite web |url=http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613230145/http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBC sitcom [[30 Rock]] often shows the power of synergy, while also poking fun at the use of the term in the corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;30 Rock episode 3.09; Liz: "I hate those corporate things; a bunch of drunk people talking about 'synergy'." Jack: "First of all, never badmouth 'synergy'!"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also different forms of synergy in popular card games like [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]], [[Cardfight!! Vanguard]], and [[Future Card Buddyfight]].

== Information theory ==

When multiple sources of [[information theory|information]] taken together provide more information than the sum of the information provided by each source alone, there is said to be a synergy in the sources. This in contrast to the case in which the sources provide less information, in which case there is said to be a [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in the sources.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; book by cognitive scientist and usability engineer [[Donald Norman]] about how design serves as the communication between object and user, and how to optimize that conduit of communication in order to make the experience of using the object pleasurable. One of the main premises of the book is that although people are often keen to blame themselves when objects appear to malfunction, it is not the fault of the user but rather the lack of intuitive guidance that should be present in the design.

The book was published in 1988 with the title '''''The Psychology of Everyday Things'''''. Norman said his academic peers liked that title, but believed the new title better conveyed the content of the book and better attracted interested readers.&lt;ref name="Preface2002"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}} It is often referred to by the initialisms '''''POET''''' and '''''DOET'''''.

Norman uses case studies to describe the psychology behind what he deems good and bad design, and proposes design principles. The book spans several disciplines including [[behavioral psychology]], [[ergonomics]], and design practice.

A major update of the book, '''''The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition''''', was published in 2013.

==Contents==

In the book, Norman introduced the term ''[[affordance]]'' as it applied to design,&lt;ref name="AboutFace3"&gt;{{cite book

He also popularized the term ''[[user-centered design]]'', which he had previously referred to in ''User Centered System Design'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deemed secondary issues like [[aesthetics]]. User-centered design involves ''simplifying the structure of tasks'', ''making things visible'', ''getting the mapping right'', ''exploiting the powers of constraint'', ''designing for error'', ''explaining affordances'' and [[seven stages of action]]. He goes to great lengths to define and explain these terms in detail, giving examples following and going against the advice given and pointing out the consequences.

Other topics of the book include:

* The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
* The Psychology of Everyday Actions
* Knowledge in the Head and in the World
* Knowing What to Do
* To Err Is Human
* [[Human-centered design]]
* The Design Challenge

After a group of industrial designers felt affronted after reading an early draft, Norman rewrote the book to make it more sympathetic to the profession.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5581">[[File:Mary Parker Follett (1868-1933).jpg|thumb|Mary P. Follett]]
"'''The Giving of Orders'''" is a 1926 essay by [[Mary Parker Follett]].&lt;ref name="TheGivingOfOrders"&gt;Follett, Mary Parker. "The giving of orders." Scientific foundations of business administration (1926): 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she addresses issues of authority in business management, specifically how managers can gain influence over informal groups that naturally form in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Nohria, Nitin. "Mary Parker Follett’s view on power, the giving of orders, and authority: An alternative to hierarchy or a utopian ideology." Mary Parker Follett–Prophet of Management (1995): 154-62.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people respond better to situations than to top-down orders and managers should give people the means and willingness to respond to given situations instead of merely giving orders: "My solution is to depersonalize the giving of orders, to unite all concerned in a study of the situation, to discover the law of the situation, and obey that."&lt;ref name="TheGivingOfOrders"/&gt;

== Background ==
As a young girl, Mary Follett faced many struggles. Her sister died while she was young and her father was in and out of her life. She was always involved in government and recent issues going on throughout her community. Although, she had limited access to research funds and other resources, she was able to write two influential books;" The New State" and "Creative Experience" which were insights gained by twenty years of civic and professional work in Boston's immigrant neighborhoods. By commuting everyday from her home in Boston to Roxbury, she recognized the difference between both cities and decided to make changes in Ward 17. With so much involvement throughout her lifetime, she started a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mary P. Follett: Creating Democracy, transforming management|last=Tonn|first=Joan|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
By addressing the way managers gain influence over informal groups, Follett explains that training the employee can not only help them better understand their job description, but also helps the employer to be better understood. She argues that "orders should be the composite conclusion of those who give and those who receive them; more than this, that they should be the integration of the people concerned and the situation; more even than this, that they should be the integrations involved in the evolving situation.".&lt;ref name="Follet, M.P 1926"&gt;Follet, M.P (1926), "The Giving of Orders", in Dynamic Administration; The Collected Works of Mary Parker Follet. Henry C. Metcalf and L. Urwick, Eds. New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1941: 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Follett found that workmen respond better to "the order integral to a particular situation", which is arrived at by "joint study of the problem". She argued that when "orders are simply part of the situation, the question of someone giving and someone receiving does not come up. Both accept the orders given by the situation." &lt;ref name="Follet, M.P 1926"/&gt; In all, Follett cautions managers to avoid giving orders but rather to look with others to the situation at hand to determine an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Cynthia (1995). "Teaching Introduction to Public Administration via the Case Method". ''Journal of Public Administration Education: 102-115''&lt;/ref&gt; Follett felt that depersonalizing orders would foster collaborative decision making, in which managers and employees would "discover" the most appropriate decision. Follett developed the circular theory of power, distinguishing between "power-over" and "power-with" (coercive vs. co-active power), while also advocating for power sharing and employee participation.&lt;ref&gt;Hopen, Deborah (2010). "The changing role and practices of successful leaders.". ''The Journal for Quality and Participation, 33(1), 4-9.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary context==

While Follett's writings were popular during her time period, they were nearly forgotten within ten years of her death. Scholars speculate that this could be due to gender discrimination and the fact that her ideas were too ahead of her time. Even though her perspective on voice is much more extreme than contemporary researchers, there has been renewed interest in her writings in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, Laurie (2005). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/00251740510597752 "Following In The Footsteps Of Mary Parker Follett: Exploring How Insights From The Past Can Advance Organizational Justice Theory And Research"]. ''Journal of Management History''.&lt;/ref&gt; Follett's work came during the height of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]'s [[Scientific Management]] movement, which advocated the "one right way" for tasks to be performed, and [[Max Weber]]'s view that direct hierarchy was the best form of leadership for larger organizations. The Giving of Orders challenged both of these paradigms and presented an alternative to purely top-down hierarchy in management. Many consider Follett “the Prophet of Management” because her ideas have affected the field of management for the past six decades.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Marsh, Mark E, W. Jeffrey (2010). "Voices From The Past: Mary Parker Follett And Joseph Smith On Collaborative Leadership". ''Journal of Management Inquiry''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Military Financing''' ('''FMF''') program provides grants and loans to help countries purchase weapons and defense equipment produced in the United States as well as acquiring defense services and military training. FMF funds purchases are made through the [[United States Foreign Military Sales|Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) program, which manages government-to-government sales. On a much less frequent basis, FMF also funds purchases made through the [[Direct Commercial Sales]] (DCS) program, which oversees sales between foreign governments and private U.S. companies. FMF does not provide cash grants to other countries; it generally pays for sales of specific goods or services through FMS or DCS.

The State Department's [[Bureau of Political-Military Affairs]] and the latter's Office of Security Assistance set policy for the FMF program, while the [[Defense Security Cooperation Agency]] (DSCA), within the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], manages it on a day-to-day basis. [[Security Assistance Organization]]s (SAOs), military personnel in [[U.S. embassies]] overseas, play a key role in managing FMF within recipient countries. Some FMF pays for SAO salaries and operational costs. Congress appropriates funds for FMF through the yearly [[Foreign Operations Appropriations Act]].

FMF exists primarily to fund arms transfers, as military training is normally granted through the [[International Military Education and Training]] (IMET) program. However, FMF does support a good deal of training.

'''Victor Jean-Baptiste Tesch''' (12 March 1812–16 June 1892)&lt;ref name=Gardini&gt;Gardini, Fausto. [http://luxembourgensia.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/12-march-1812-victor-jean-baptiste-tesch.html "12 March 1812: Victor Jean-Baptiste Tesch"]. Luxembourgensia.blogspot.co.uk. 2012. Retrieved on 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Luxembourgish and Belgian jurist, industrialist, journalist and liberal politician. 

He was born in 1812 in [[Messancy]] (then still part of Luxembourg, now part of Belgium), one of nine children of Jean-Frédérich Tesch (1774-1844) and Marie-Cécile Nothomb (1780-1869). He studied law, graduating from the [[University of Liège]] in 1832 with a Doctor of law at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=Gardini /&gt; He settled in [[Arlon]] and registered at the bar there. He was a friend of Émile Tandel, the district commissioner for Arlon-Virton, secretary of the Archeological Institute of Luxembourg and author of ''Communes luxembourgeoises''. When he was a councillor of the city of Arlon, Tesch collaborated with Georges Wurth to establish an Athénée there.&lt;ref name=Cercle&gt; Moïs, C.; Zimmerman, J.M.; Gillet, C. [http://messancy-histoire.be/dossiers/messancy/les-batiments-tesch-et-castilhon "Les bâtiments Tesch et Castilhon"]. (in French) Cercle d'histoire du pays de Messancy. Retrieved on 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He associated with Nicolas Berger, a Luxembourgish banker in Arlon who opted for Belgian citizenship, [[Emmanuel Servais]], later prime minister, and [[Charles Metz]], an industrialist and politician.&lt;ref name="Gardini" /&gt; Tesch was an important figure in the founding of various iron and steel companies that would later become the [[ARBED]] steel group.&lt;ref name="Gardini" /&gt; 

In 1856 Berger had the idea of linking the collieries of the [[Saarbrücken|Saar]] and the iron ore mines of Luxembourg to establish an iron foundry in [[Saarbrücken]]. Tesch was enthusiastic, and joined in the venture, soon becoming its president. The works was established in Burbach.&lt;ref name=Cercle /&gt; 

The [[Ostende]]-Arlon railway line was opened in 1858, and connected to the Luxembourgish network in 1859, then to the Saar. The [[Longwy]] branch, via Messancy, was operational from 1860. This linked the industrial sites of the two Luxembourgs, [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and the Saar, to the benefit of industry.&lt;ref name=Cercle /&gt;  

In 1862, a new company merged the foundries of Burbach with the enterprise of [[Auguste Metz]] in Eich. Later, Tesch and [[Norbert Metz]] established works in Dudelange, opened in 1886. Tesch was active throughout his whole life in finance and industry, sitting on the boards of directors of 38 companies: 10 collieries, 4 real estate companies, 13 railway companies, 4 metal-working companies and 5 banks.&lt;ref name=Cercle /&gt; His impact on the economic development of the south of Luxembourg was therefore significant.  

Highly attached to his native region, Tesch was vehemently against the partition that would split off the Grand Duchy from the Province of Luxembourg. He was active in politics, and founded a liberal newspaper alongside Emmanuel Servais, Charles Metz and Auguste Wurth, the ''Écho du Luxembourg'', which first appeared in 1836. Tesch thereby opposed his cousin, Jean Baptiste Nothomb, who was in favour of the partition. After 1839, Tesch, like Auguste Wurth, chose Belgian nationality. From 1837 he was in the city council of Arlon, and from 1838 to 1848 also sat in the provincial council.   

Tesch was the Belgian minister of justice from 1850 to 1852 and from 1857 to 1865.&lt;ref name="Gardini" /&gt; In 1855 he was asked by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] to form a new government, but refused.  

In 1866 Tesch built the cháteau "Le Castel" in Messancy.  

By marrying his cousin, Hélène-Cécile-Caroline Nothomb, he married into the respected Nothomb family. They had three daughters, and all three of Tesch's sons-in-law would become founding members of ARBED:&lt;ref name=Gardini /&gt;

*Léonie Wilhelmina Tesch: married Léon Barbanson (1843-1912)
*Cécile Henriette Tesch: married Hubert Müller (d. 1917), director of the steelworks in Esch-Alzette, co-founder of ARBED
*Edmée Tesch: married [[Émile Metz]] (1835-1904), foundry owner at Dudelange
