'''Bankenviertel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbaŋkn̩ˌfɪɐ̯tl̩}}; ''banking district'') is the name of the [[central business district]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It designates an area in the city centre where many banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions are located. It is the most important [[financial centre]] in Germany and one of the largest in Europe along with [[La Défense]] in the [[Paris aire urbaine]] and [[London]]'s [[City of London|City]] and [[Canary Wharf]].

Having no official or strict borders, it is commonly defined as the western part of the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], the southern part of the [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and the eastern part of the [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]]. Its most central square is the [[Opernplatz]].

The Bankenviertel is not an official city district and has no officially or strictly defined borders. It stretches across three city districts: the western part of the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], the southern part of the [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and the eastern part of the [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]]. Many of the largest banks in Germany, e.g. [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] and [[Helaba]], have their corporate headquarters here, as well as many representation offices of foreign banks. It is also the place where most of [[List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt|Frankfurts high-rises and skyscrapers]] are located, which gave it also the nicknames Bankfurt and  [[Mainhattan]].

The heart of the Bankenviertel is located on both sides of the Taunus- and Gallusanlage, an inner-city parkway, and the surrounding streets (Neue Mainzer Straße, Junghofstraße, Kaiserstraße), and the central square of the Bankenviertel is the [[Opernplatz]]. Furthermore, the area on both sides of the [[Mainzer Landstraße]] from Taunusanlage to Platz der Republik and the Bockenheimer Landstraße, beginning at the [[Alte Oper|Opernplatz]], are part of the area. The Bankenviertel also includes the areas near the Opernplatz on its eastern side, notably the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] 300 meters east of the Opernplatz, as well as a number of banks in its immediate vicinity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5047">The '''Becher Process''' is an [[industrial process]] used to upgrade [[ilmenite]] to [[synthetic rutile]].

The [[mineral]], ilmenite, contains 55-65% [[titanium]] as [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the rest being [[iron oxide]]. The Becher process removes the iron oxide, leaving a residue of [[synthetic rutile]], which is more than 90% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemlink.com.au/titan_rutile.htm| title=Rutile and ilmenite - Australian production and potential profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This technology was developed in the early 1960s in [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/info/factsheets/titanium.jsp |title=Australian Atlas of Mineral Resources Mineral Sands Fact Sheet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830005748/http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/info/factsheets/titanium.jsp |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a joint initiative between industry and government. The process was named after [[Robert Gordon Becher]], who while working at the Western Australian Government Chemical Laboratories invented, developed and introduced the technique to the Western Australian Mineral Sands industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cluniesross.org.au/the-awards/previous-award-winners/1992-award-winners/ |title=ATSE Clunies Ross Foundation Medal Awards - 1992 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was patented in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/patents/WO1996024699A1?cl=en|title=Treatment of titanium-containing material |publisher=CLAIMS Patent Services|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

The Becher Process is suitable for [[weathered]] ilmenite that has low [[concentration]]s of [[chromium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwscience.murdoch.edu.au/teach/m358/titanium.pdf |title=Murdoch University Titanium |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201183427/http://wwwscience.murdoch.edu.au/teach/m358/titanium.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmentite:
# [[Oxidation]]
# [[Redox]]
# [[Aeration]]
# [[Leaching (chemical science)|Leaching]]

===Oxidation===
Oxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert all of the iron in the ilmenite grains to [[iron(III) oxide]]:

: 4 FeTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

This allows for use of a wide range of ilmenite materials with varying Fe(II) and Fe(III) content to be used in the next step.

===Reduction===
Reduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), coal and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.cmewa.com.au/images/1_MineralSands.pdf |title=Chamber of Minerals and Energy Western Australia - Mineral Sands Factsheet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132348/http://www.education.cmewa.com.au/images/1_MineralSands.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite:

: Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CO &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; +  TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;

Once the Reduced Ilmenite has cooled it is separated from the char by screening, then continues to the next step of the process.

===Aeration===
Aeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by "rusting" it out. This is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% [[ammonium chloride]] solution with air being pumped through the tank. The tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate out of solution, away from the titanium dioxide portion in the form of a slime.

: 4 Fe &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile.

=== Acid Leach ===
Once the majority of the Iron Oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5M [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=1994%2F03647&amp;IA=WO1994%2F03647&amp;DISPLAY=DESC |title=WIPO-WO/1994/003647 TREATMENT OF TITANIFEROUS MATERIALS }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Soda''' is a term used by the media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/may2006/pi20060504_428474.htm "Big Soda's Sticky End." ''Business Week.'']&lt;/ref&gt; and various activist groups&lt;ref&gt;"Big Soda vs. Our Kids: Better Beware of Benzene in Soda Pop." ''CommonDreams.org Newsletter''[http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0312-24.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[CrossFit]] to describe the [[soft drink]] industry as a collective entity.

The term connotes the business and [[lobbying]] power of soft drink companies who, like [[Big Oil]] and [[Big Tobacco]], would use that power to influence politicians and voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/big-soda-echoing-big-tobacco-s-tactics-report/306232/&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Soda usually refers to the giants of the soft drink industry, [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[PepsiCo]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/opinion/fight-big-soda.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">The '''Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students''' ('''BASES''') is a student group at [[Stanford University]] focusing on business and entrepreneurial activities. One of the largest student-run entrepreneurship organizations in the world, BASES' mission is to promote entrepreneurship education at Stanford University and to empower student entrepreneurs by bringing together the worlds of entrepreneurship, academia, and industry. BASES organizes the flagship 150K Challenge, Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders' Seminar, the SVI Hackspace, E-Bootcamp, and the Freshman Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-47758620100416, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fsb/0708/gallery.bestcolleges_undergrads.fsb/10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

BASES was founded in 1996 by a group of five Stanford engineers. The organization works in partnership with Silicon Valley's venture capitalists and law firms to provide a variety of entrepreneurial services to Stanford students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biztechday.com/2-powerful-entrepreneur-organizations-silicon-valley-san-francisco/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
BASES hosts two annual business plan competitions, one catering to for-profit startups (E-Challenge) and the other for [[social venture]]s (Social E-Challenge). It hosts a third, concurrent product showcase competition for product prototypes. A total of $150,000 is awarded each year in these competitions. Entirely student-managed, the competition attracts students from all programs and levels at Stanford. Teams must include at least one full-time Stanford student, but participation is not restricted to the Stanford community. Past winners include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iitbombay.org/news/Current/iitians-bag-prize-for-social-change&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/06/0610_stanford_good_social_entrepreneurs/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">A '''business alliance''' is an agreement between businesses, usually motivated by [[cost reduction]] and improved service for the customer. Alliances are often bounded by a single agreement with [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] [[risk]] and opportunity share for all parties involved and are typically managed by an integrated project team. An example of this is [[code sharing]] in [[airline alliance]]s.

==Types==
There are five basic categories or types of alliances:&lt;ref name="Kuglin"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuglin | first = F.A. | authorlink = |author2=J. Hook | title = Building, Leading, and Managing Strategic Alliances: How to Work Effectively and Profitably With Partner Companies | publisher = American Management Association | date = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sales: A sales alliance occurs when two companies agree to go to market together to sell complementary products and services. 
*Solution-specific: A solution-specific alliance occurs when two companies agree to jointly develop and sell a specific marketplace solution. 
*Geographic-specific:  A geographic-specific alliance is developed when two companies agree to jointly market or [[co-brand]] their products and services in a specific geographic region.
*Investment: An investment alliance occurs when two companies agree to join their funds for mutual investment. 
*Joint venture: A [[joint venture]] is an alliance that occurs when two or more companies agree to undertake economic activity together.

In many cases, alliances between companies can involve two or more categories or types of alliances.

== Horizontal alliances ==

A type of an alliance is a horizontal alliance. For example, a horizontal alliance can occur between [[logistics |logistics service providers]], i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"&gt;Raue, J.S. &amp; Wieland, A. (2015), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/IJLM-08-2012-0083 The interplay of different types of governance in horizontal cooperations: a view on logistics service providers]. The International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 26, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can "access tangible resources which are directly exploitable." In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can "access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable." This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.&lt;ref name="rauewieland"/&gt;

[[File:Armored-truck.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Prosegur]] Armored car in Barcelona]]
'''Cash-in-transit''' ('''CIT''') or '''cash/valuables-in-transit''' ('''CVIT''') is the physical transfer of [[banknotes]], [[coins]], [[credit cards]] and items of value from one location to another. The locations include cash centers and bank branches, ATM points, large retailers and other premises holding large amounts of cash such as ticket vending machines and parking meters.

Many cash in transit companies are [[private security]] companies that offer cash handling as part of their services. [[Loomis (company)|Loomis]] is today the only major CIT business that is fully dedicated to cash handling after the split from [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitas.com/en/News/Press-Releases/2006/Securitas-Cash-Handling-Services-announces-new-international-brand-identity-Loomis/|title=Securitas Cash Handling Services announces new international brand identity "Loomis"|accessdate=18 Nov 2013|publisher=Securitas Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loomis.com/en/Business-amp-Markets/Our-business/|title=Our Business|accessdate=18 Nov 2013|publisher=Loomis AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brinks spun off its home security division setting the focus as well on cash handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-brinks-company-to-spin-off-brinks-home-security-to-shareholders-57117492.html|title=The Brink's Company to Spin-Off Brink's Home Security to Shareholders|accessdate=18 Nov 2013|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By law, the CIT companies are seen as [[Logistics|logistic]] companies in the [[private security]] industry and therefore have to comply with transport and security legislation. In some countries, the transportation of cash has its own [[legislation]] (for example, Europe has varying CIT laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coess.org/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Comparative_overview_CIT_legislation_15_MS_full_text_EN.pdf |title=A comparative overview of the legislations governing the Cash in Transit private industry in the 15 EU members |accessdate=18 Nov 2013 |publisher=Confederation of European Security Services |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030171801/http://www.coess.org/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Comparative_overview_CIT_legislation_15_MS_full_text_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The CIT industry is regulated by national, regional and local legislation, social regulations and current practices. Responsible authorities are usually the [[Ministry of the Interior]], the [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[police]]. Legislation and regulations may impose requirements and restrictions on use of [[firearms]], types of vehicles, minimum number of crew members, and use of [[Intelligent banknote neutralisation system|Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems]].

CIT services can be carried out in [[soft-skinned]], semi-armoured or armoured vehicles. The use of soft-skinned vehicles is normally only allowed when alternative security methods, such as [[intelligent banknote neutralisation system]]s, are also used. Security cases containing IBNS are provided by companies as StrongPoint Cash Security and Oberthür. Such CIT is commonly referred to as “Light CIT”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication16271_en.pdf |title=EU WHITE PAPER ON PROFESSIONAL CROSS BORDER TRANSPORTATION OF EURO CASH BY ROAD – EBF WISHLIST |accessdate=18 Nov 2013 |publisher=European Banking Federation }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
Inside CIT, the companies are specialized in the transportation and processing of cash and valuables, [[precious metals]]. They transport [[banknotes]], [[coins]], bulk cash, [[diamonds]], non-personalised [[smart cards]], non-personalised [[passports]] and other valuables. That is why, in many countries, the service was renamed 'Asset handling' or 'Asset-in-transit'.

== Cash processing ==
Cash processing is an industrial process far removed from traditional banking activities and culture. The internal organization of cash handling within banks is often obsolete and inefficient, inherited from old bank organizations and further complicated by mergers, acquisitions and restructuring. This has led the majority of banks to opt for the outsourcing of wholesale cash processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esta-cash.eu/documents/budapest-documents/cash_outsourcing___cash_recycling___niven___smith.pdf|title=Session IV: Cash Outsourcing and Cash Recycling|accessdate=18 Nov 2013|publisher=European Security Transport Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are on the other hand inherent difficulties associated with outsourcing. One of them is the loss of control and the reliance on external providers. In some cases, banks no longer have the know-how in relation to cash handling.

Cash processing has evolved from a labor-intensive activity focused on the transportation of cash to a capital-intensive industry offering end-to end solutions. Transport no longer constitutes the value added in the business but continues to structure the organization. The CIT’s footprint remains a key factor of selection by banks and retailers.

The industry is generally divided into two sectors:  Processing, and  ATM servicing

==Major players==
Five companies command nearly 60% of the global CIT market (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4s.com/~/media/Files/Financial%20Presentations/London%20Cash%20Centre%20Presentation.ashx|title=Cash Solutions|accessdate=18 Nov 2013|publisher=G4S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are:
* [[Brink's]] – 23%
* [[G4S]] – 15%
* [[Loomis (company)|Loomis]] – 12%
* [[Prosegur]] – 7%
* [[Garda (security company)|Garda]] – 4%
* [[GSLS]] – 0.01%
* Others – 39%

Few companies outside these five have cross-border operations. This is in part seen as a result of the significant cost to establish a CIT operation.

== CIT guards ==
Most armored cars have two to three occupants:
* A [[driver (person)|driver]], who is normally never allowed to leave the vehicle until it returns to the garage
* 1–2 guards who deliver the cash or valuables

Depending on the jurisdiction, the guards are armed with weapons. Most guards are issued with [[shotgun]]s, while others carry [[handgun]]s. [[Submachine gun]]s and even [[assault rifle]]s maybe equipped by those officers in some countries. These guards are required to have firearms training before they can carry them.

Six member states of the European Union prohibit weapons during cash-in-transit (CIT) operations.&lt;ref name="coess"&gt;[http://www.coess.org/pdf/CIT_legislations.pdf ''A comparative overview of the legislations governing the Cash in Transit private industry in the 15 EU members''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105230144/http://www.coess.org/pdf/CIT_legislations.pdf |date=2009-01-05 }} (PDF). CoESS / UNI-Europa joint Report. October 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also required to wear [[bullet-proof vest]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/worker/docs/armoured-car-guard.pdf|title=Specific Requirements and Training for a ARMOURED CAR GUARD|publisher= BC Ministry of Justice|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806074220/http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/securityindustry/worker/docs/armoured-car-guard.pdf|archivedate= August 6, 2009|date=June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or ballistic helmets.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16125">A '''Customs declaration''' is a [[Form (document)|form]] that lists the details of goods that are being imported or exported when a citizen or visitor enters a [[customs territory]] (country's borders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures/general-overview/customs-declaration_en|title=Customs declaration|website=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most countries require travellers to complete a customs declaration form when bringing notified goods ([[alcoholic drink]]s, [[tobacco products]], animals, fresh food, plant material, seeds, [[soil]]s, meats, and [[animal product]]s) across international borders. Posting items via international mail also requires the sending party to complete a customs declaration form.

The declaration form helps the customs to control the goods that entered the country, which can affect the country's economy, security or environment. A levy [[Tariff#Customs duty|duty]] may be applied.

Travellers have to declare everything they acquired abroad and possibly pay [[customs]] duty tax on goods. Some countries offer a duty-free allowance of certain products which may not need to be declared explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods|title=Bringing goods into the UK|website=GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of forms==
* When an individual is transporting the goods, the form is called a customs arrival card, or a landing card, or an entry voucher. The traveller is required to fill out the form, sign and submit to the customs or border protection officer before entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atacarnet.com/carnet-countries |title=Carnet Countries|website=atacsrnet.com - Corporation for International Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When an individual or an organization ships goods across the borders, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as a [[commercial invoice]], or a [[Pro forma#Invoices|proforma invoice]], an import declaration form, an [[ATA Carnet]], or a re-[[export]] declaration. [[Incoterms]] on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. An [[Harmonized System|Harmonized System Code]] (Hs code or harmonized code) might be required to define the type of goods and their associated tax rate. The importer is usually required to provide information about the goods' country of origin and the [[certificate of origin]]. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a [[customs brokerage]] to clear goods through customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/418/~/importers---who-needs-a-customs-broker-to-help-clear-goods-through-cbp|website= US Customs and Border Patrol|title=Importers - Who needs a Customs Broker to Help Clear Goods Through CBP?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations require a customs declaration form from each person crossing the border, while other nations require one form per family traveling together. A family is usually defined as family members residing in the same household, who are related by marriage, adoption, blood, or domestic relationship.&lt;ref name="cbp.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/travel/CBP-declaration-form-6059B |website=U.S. Customs and Border Protection |title=Declaration Form 6059B, CBP Issues New Customs Declarations Form, Features Expanded Definition of Family Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/quest/sddquest.nsf/12df43879eb9b25e4c256809001ee0fe/9226dae2ca1cf9564c2569650002caeb?OpenDocument|title=NZIS431 - New Zealand Passenger Departure Card|website=Statistics New Zealand|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015173611/http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/quest/sddquest.nsf/12df43879eb9b25e4c256809001ee0fe/9226dae2ca1cf9564c2569650002caeb?OpenDocument|archivedate=2008-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/border-security/travel/passenger-cards/index.htm |title=Passenger Cards|author=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|website= Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[U.S. Customs]] asks the Head of a household to complete the form (CBP Form 6059B {{as of|2016|July|lc=y}}). Family members residing in the same household, who are related by marriage, adoption, blood, or domestic relationship, can use one form.
*For returning U.S. residents: The personal duty exemption for each family member is $800.00. For example, a family of five members returning is allowed a combined personal duty exemption of $4,000 (calculated as $800 for each family member multiplied by 5).&lt;ref name="cbp.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens cbp.gov, US Customs, US Citizens travelling]&lt;/ref&gt;
* For international visitors: US laws allow visitors some exemptions, like tobacco, gifts, personal effects, etc. The head of a household can complete a form for a family. It is good to check the current duties and exemptions to avoid tax or loss of goods.
*Anyone travelling with more than $10,000 must declare it.&lt;ref name="cbp.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors cbp.gov, US Customs, US international visitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/travel/canadian-and-mexican-citizens# cbp.gov, US Customs, For Canadian and Mexican Citizens]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13038">'''Deinking''' is the [[industrial process]] of removing [[printing ink]] from [[Fiber crop|paperfibers]] of [[recycled paper]] to make [[deinked pulp]].

The key in the deinking process is the ability to detach ink from the fibers. This is achieved by a combination of mechanical action and chemical means. In Europe the most common process is [[froth flotation]] deinking.

Paper is one of the main targets for [[Paper recycling|recycling]]. A concern about recycling [[wood pulp]] paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being recycled 4–6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making paper.&lt;ref name="paperinfosheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paper Recycling Information Sheet|url=http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/paper.htm |publisher=Waste Online |accessdate= October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|history of paper}}
Before the invention of the [[paper machine]] in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name [[rag paper]]. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials.&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper recycling|Recycling of used paper]] before the [[industrialisation]] of paper production, rag paper was recycled to make low-grade [[Paperboard|board]]. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by [[German people|German]] jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; He practiced together with German paper producer [[Johann Engelhard Schmid]]. Today this method is called deinking.

First in the 1950s and 1960s the use of recycled fibres from paper made of wood pulp begun to increase, and was mainly used in packaging paper and paperboard. In the 1950s the [[froth flotation]] technique was adapted for deinking [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Pulp |editor1-last=Sixta |editor1-first=Herbert |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Germany |isbn=3-527-30999-3 |volume=2 |page=1174 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of recovered paper increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of recovered paper increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 recovered paper production was 42% of the total paper production.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==Deinking process==
[[File:Deinking (schematic layout).svg|thumb|right|350px|Schematic layout of a deinking plant.]]

===Sorting===
Waste paper may contain a mixture of different [[Paper#Applications|paper types]] made of mixtures of different paperfibers. These must be sorted before processed. Broke (paper waste from paper production) is normally used directly in the [[papermachine]].
* Office waste (OW)
* Old [[magazine paper]]s (OMP)
* Old [[newspaper|newsprint]] (ONP)
* [[Paperboard]]
* [[Corrugated fiberboard]]
Recycled paper can be used to make paper of the same or lower quality than it was originally. The sorted paper is baled and shipped to a [[papermill]]. The pulpmill uses waste paper grade according to the paper quality they want to make.

===Debaling===
The bales are opened and large foreign objects are sorted out on the [[conveyor belt]] to the [[pulper]]. Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a "ragger". Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |title=Packaging Tapes: To Recycle of Not |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Jensen |first=Timothy |date=April 1999 |publisher=Adhesives and Sealants Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109204909/http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |archivedate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pulping===
Pulpers are either batch, which uses a tub with a high shear rotor, or continuous, using a long, perforated drum.  Drum pulpers are very expensive but have the advantage of not breaking up contaminants, thus giving cleaner end product.

The pulper chops the paper to smaller pieces; water and chemicals are added. Normally the [[pH]] is adjusted to 8.5 - 10.0. Normal deinking chemicals are: 
* pH control: [[sodium silicate]] or [[sodium hydroxide]]
* Bleaching: [[hydrogen peroxide]]
* [[Calcium]] [[ion]] source: [[hard water]], [[lime (material)|lime]] or [[calcium chloride]]
* Collector: [[fatty acid]], fatty acid [[emulsion]], fatty acid [[soap]] or organo-modified [[siloxane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

&lt;/ref&gt;
After pulping, the mixture is a [[slurry]]. The slurry goes to [[Kraft process#Screening|screening]].

===Cleaning and screening===
[[Centrifugal cleaning]] is spinning the pulp slurry in a cleaner, causing materials that are denser than pulp fibers to move outward and be rejected. [[Sieve|Screens]], with either slots or holes, are used to remove contaminants that are larger than pulp fibers.

Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated cartons and '''[[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]''', soft rubbery particles which can make deposits and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from [[book binding]]s, [[hot melt adhesive]]s, PSA [[adhesive]]s from paper labels, [[laminating]] adhesives of reinforced gummed [[Adhesive tape|tapes]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlmi.com/recycling-standards.php |title=Recycling Compatible Adhesives Standards |accessdate=2007-11-06 |year=2007 |publisher=Tag and Label Manufacturers Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109230413/http://www.tlmi.com/recycling-standards.php |archivedate=2007-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf |title=Voluntary Standard for Repulping and Recycling Corugated Fiberboard |accessdate=2007-11-06 |year=2005 |publisher=Corrugated Packaging Alliance |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203163418/http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1998/seite98a.pdf |title=Environmentally benign USPS stamps  | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |last=Seiter, Pikulin, |first= |date=October 1998 |publisher=TAPPI Pulping Conference|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deinking stage===
In the deinking stage the goal is to release and remove the [[hydrophobic]] contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly [[printing ink]] and [[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]. Several processes are used, most commonly flotation or washing.

====Flotation deinking====
[[Image:FlCell.PNG|thumb|240px|right|Diagram of a [[froth flotation]] cell.]]
[[Froth flotation]] was adapted from the flotation process used in the [[mining industry]] in the 1960s. It is the most common deinking process in [[Europe]] used to recover [[recycled paper]]. Often most of the collector is added to the inlet of the flotation. The process temperatures are normally in the range 45 - 55 °C. [[Air]] is blown into the pulp [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The collector has [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] both to the ink particles and air bubbles, causing them to attach. The air bubbles lift the ink to the surface and form a thick [[froth]] that can be removed. Normally the setup is a two stage system with 3, 4 or 5 flotation cells in series.&lt;ref&gt;Voith EcoCell flotation plant {{cite web |url=http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824075218/http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flotation deinking is very effective in removing ink particles larger than about 10&amp;nbsp;µm.

====Wash deinking====
Wash deinking consists of a washing stage where [[dispersant]]s are added to wash out the [[printing ink]]s. When the pulp slurry is [[dewatering|dewatered]] (thickened), the medium to fine particles are [[Washing|washed]] out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30&amp;nbsp;µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and [[stickies (papermaking)|micro stickies]]. This process is more common when making [[deinked pulp]] for [[Facial tissue|tissue]]. The processing equipment are  [[belt filter]]s, pressure belt filters, [[disk filter]]s and static [[Water filter|filters]]. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.

====Combined washing and flotation====
High quality deinking of office wastes and other printing papers often commonly uses a combination of washing and flotation.

====Enzymatic deinking====
This method of deinking uses industrial or food grade enzymes in conjunction with flotation deinking to aid in the removal of inks in recycling mills. More efficient removal of ink increases fiber yield, decreases dirt count, and increases paper brightness. Often the use of enzymatic deinking helps mills reduce their bleach usage or use cheaper furnish.

====Other deinking processes====
[[Dissolved air flotation]] (DAF) is used by some mills in the deinking stage and will remove some ink and filler (ash); however, it is mainly used to clarify the process water.

===Washing / dewatering===
Washing / dewatering (thickening) is a filtration process. Small particles (&lt; 5&amp;nbsp;µm) are removed by passing water through the pulp.

===Bleaching===
{{Main|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

If white paper is desired, [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] uses [[peroxide]]s or [[sodium dithionite|hydrosulfites]] to increase the [[brightness]] of the pulp. The bleaching methods are similar for mechanical pulp, but the goal is to make the fiber brighter.

===Papermaking===
The deinked fiber is made into a new paper product in the same way that virgin [[wood fiber]], see [[papermaking]].

===Byproducts===
The unusable material left over, mainly ink, plastics, filler and short fibers, is called '''sludge'''. The sludge is buried in a landfill, burned to create energy at the paper mill or used as a fertilizer by local farmers.

===Problems===
Water based [[flexo]]graphic printing inks with [[particle size]]s below 5&amp;nbsp;µm and poor solubility in [[alkaline]] conditions may cause problems in deinking, especially in the flotation stage. The solution is to use an extra [[acidic]] washing stage.

Temperature control is important as this affects the stickiness of [[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]].

Additional issues arise when taking into account the number of chemicals potentially present in paper for recycling. Studies have indicated that paper might contain as many as 10,000 different chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Waste paper for recycling: Overview and identification of potentially critical substances|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15001312|journal = Waste Management|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.028|first = Kostyantyn|last = Pivnenko|first2 = Eva|last2 = Eriksson|first3 = Thomas F.|last3 = Astrup}}&lt;/ref&gt; fate of which in the deinking process still remains unknown.

'''Enterprise marketing management''' ('''EMM''') defines a category of software used by marketing operations to manage their end-to-end internal processes.  EMM is subset of Marketing Technologies which consists of a total of 3 key technology types that allow for corporations and customers to participate in a holistic and real-time marketing campaign.

EMM consists of other marketing software categories such as Web Analytics, Campaign Management, Digital Asset Management, Web Content Management, Marketing Resource Management, Marketing Dashboards, Lead Management, Event-driven Marketing, Predictive Modeling and more.  The goal of deploying and using EMM is to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing by increasing operational efficiency, decreasing costs and waste, and standardizing marketing processes for an accurate and predictable time to market.  The benefit of using an EMM suite rather than a variety of point solutions is improved collaboration, efficiency and visibility across the entire marketing function, as well as reduced total cost of ownership.  Depending on the variable combinations of solutions, EMM can mean several different things to specific brands and industries.  Enterprise Marketing Management allows for corporations to put in place a baseline of their operations that will allow them to begin evolution towards a holistic solution that incorporates customer experience, expectation and brand value associated with Marketing Technologies.

===KB Financial Group (Chairman): 2010 ~ 2013===
Euh Yoon-Dae was inaugurated as Chairman of [[KB Kookmin Bank|KB Financial Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbfng.com/Eng/index.jsp KB Financial Group]&lt;/ref&gt; on July 13, 2010. In his inaugural speech, Euh said the Group needed to slim down and cut costs to achieve its vision of becoming a global bank,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2923169|title=Euh vows to slim down an ‘obese’ KB|last=|first=|date=|website=koreajoongangdaily|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has launched reforms since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/business/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100728000771 KoreaHerald] retrieved 29th July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/07/124_70276.html|title=Euh Yoon-dae, second from left, chairman of KB Financial ...|date=2010-07-27|work=koreatimes|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential Council on Nation Branding (Chairman): 2009 ~ 2010===
Euh Yoon-Dae was chairman of the [[Presidential Council on Nation Branding, Korea|Presidential Council on Nation Branding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreabrand.net|title=koreabrand.net|website=www.koreabrand.net|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to this position in January 2009.

The Council was established on January 22, 2009 by Executive Decree 21283 with the objective to promote South Korea's global image; to right misconceptions about South Korea, its culture, its products, and its people; and to raise respect for South Korea so as to support South Korean businesses and nationals abroad through governmental initiated strategies and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.inews24.com/php/news_view.php?g_serial=387911&amp;g_menu=020300|title=국가브랜드위원회 출범…위원장에 어윤대 전 고려대 총장|last=|first=|date=2009-01-22|website=아이뉴스|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea University (President): 2003~2006===
During his presidency (2003~2006), 12,000 seats were secured within the library (the largest number of library seats amongst Korean universities), one third of classes were conducted in English, the number of foreign exchange students increased sharply, and modern buildings and shopping malls were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.korea.ac.kr/do/MessageBoard/ArticleRead.do?forum=kunews&amp;id=4b272f|title=고려대학교|website=www.korea.ac.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite much advancement, Euh failed to be reelected as president. His critics argue that Euh led the school of extreme market principles and internationalism. Prior to his presidency, English classes only amounted 4%. This figure changed to 34% of total classes at Korea University within the four years of his presidency.
His supporters agree that most international universities value international competitiveness and administer their schools accordingly. Euh has also succeeded in raising 470 billion [[South Korean won|Korean won]] as a University Development Fund.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7179">The '''European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises''' or '''UEAPME''' is an [[Employers' organization|umbrella group for associations]] of [[Small and medium enterprise|SMEs]] based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. UEAPME represents the interests of European crafts, trades and SMEs at [[European Union|EU]] level. Its 67 member organisations from 34 European countries consist of national cross-sectorial SME federations, European branch federations and other associate members. Its members combined represent more than 12 million enterprises, which employ around 50 million [[people]] across [[Europe]]. UEAPME is a recognised [[Social partners|European Social Partner]].

==History==

UEAPME was founded in 1980. The first headquarters of the association were in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. After some years in Germany, the organisation moved its headquarters to [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], where it was established in 1991 as an international not for profit association under Belgian law ([[AISBL]]). The acronym UEAPME was made official in this incorporation and stands for “Union Européenne de l’Artisanat et des Petites et Moyennes Enterprises”, i.e. the European Union of Crafts and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises.

The aims of UEAPME as written in its statutes&lt;ref name="statutes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2004/10/08/04142048.pdf |title=UEAPME statutes on the Belgian Ministry of Justice website (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:

* Monitoring the EU policy and legislative process and keeping its members informed on all matters of European Union policy of relevance to crafts, trades and SMEs;
* Representing and promoting the interests, needs and opinions of its member organisations to the EU institutions and other international organisations;
* Supporting its members academically, technically and legally on all areas of EU policy;
* Supporting the idea of European integration and contributing to European co-operation.

As of 1998, UEAPME is a European Social Partner alongside [[BUSINESSEUROPE]] (previously UNICE), the [[European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation and of Enterprises of General Economic Interest]] (CEEP) and the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] (ETUC). In 1996, the first negotiations between UNICE, CEEP and ETUC led to the conclusion of a framework agreement on parental leave. UEAPME challenged the validity of the directive implementing the agreement before the [[European Court of First Instance]], claiming a violation of its own right to negotiate. The complaint was dismissed in June 1998,&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996A0135:EN:HTML |title=Union Européenne de l’Artisanat et des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (UEAPME) v. Council of the European Union, Case T-135/96 (1998) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the court case created political momentum for the opening of discussions with UNICE, according to the principle of mutual recognition. In November of the same year, the two organisations reached an agreement, further to which UEAPME became a recognised participant in the European social dialogue.

==Structure==

UEAPME is run by a Secretariat based in Brussels consisting of 20 staff members working in thematic directorates. The Secretariat also includes an administrative section, a press office and a Study Unit.  The current President is [[Ulrike Rabmer-Koller]], from Austria, since January 2016.

The UEAPME structure also includes a Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueapme.com/spip.php?rubrique8 |title=Board of Directors |publisher=UEAPME |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several Committees, Working Groups and Task Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueapme.com/spip.php?rubrique9 |title=Committees, Working Groups and Task Forces |publisher=UEAPME |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==

'''Expander System Sweden AB''' is a Swedish company that designs, manufactures, and sells a pivot-pin system for commercial heavy machinery and equipment.  Their headquarters is in [[Åtvidaberg]], [[Sweden]]. It was founded in 1986 by Everth and Roger Svensson. The Expander Group includes two subsidiaries, Expander Americas Inc, in the [[United States]], and Expander Deutschland GmbH, in [[Germany]].

The expander system consists of patented products that are intended to take the place of conventional pivot pins in [[heavy machinery]] and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called [[Boring (manufacturing)|line boring]]. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4905">'''Gerishon Kamau Kirima''' was a major [[Kenya]]n real estate investor and a former Member of Parliament.

==Early life==
Kirima was born in Kiruri village, a tea-growing area of [[Muranga County|Murang’a County]] on the slopes of the [[Aberdares]]. He dropped out of school at an early age.&lt;ref name="businessdailyafrica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/539550-1081276-md9lg8z/index.html|title=A frugal carpenters epic struggle to the helm of real estate fortune|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Kirima relocated from his village to the [[Kinangop Plateau]] where he started a carpentry business. In the early 1960s after Kenya had attained independence, he moved to Nairobi and registered his business ''Kirima and Sons Ltd''.&lt;ref name="businessdailyafrica.com"/&gt; He was the pioneer carpenter at the [[University of Nairobi]] and operated a small workshop in Bahati and later on in Kaloleni. His first wife, Agnes, would help attend to customers at the Kaloleni workshop. Taking advantage of the rural-urban migration to Nairobi that resulted from the dawn of independence and the end of the state of emergency, Kirima opened bars and butcheries in Asian and African neighborhoods to cater for the growing moneyed class. He is considered a pioneer of ''nyama choma'', a popular Kenyan delicacy.&lt;ref name="nation.co.ke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/how-kmc-dalliance-with-hubris-became-a-blessing-for-Kirima/440808-3255946-7j6ebh/index.html|title=KAMAU: How KMC’s dalliance with hubris became a blessing for|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1967, and to the surprise of the better educated African civil servants, Kirima had saved enough money to buy 500 acres of land in Nairobi from an Italian Donenico Masi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/539550-1081276-item-1-ankjabz/index.html|title=A frugal carpenters epic struggle to the helm of real estate fortune|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Kirima bought two more farms in Nairobi - 108 acres from Charles Case and 472 acres from Percy Randall. With these acquisitions, Kirima had positioned himself to be a major meat supplier for Nairobi.

As chairman of the African Butchers Association (later the Kenya National Butchers Union), he successfully lobbied the government for permission to sell meat in the city, a privilege that was hitherto reserved for the still settler-controlled Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) which did not buy meat from African farmers.&lt;ref name="nation.co.ke"/&gt; Kirima started a private abattoir in Njiru, a development that some believe led to the eventual collapse of the KMC years later.

He would venture into the transport business by launching the Kirima Bus Services. However, the business didn't last long following the liberalization of upcountry transportation by the government in 1973. He opted to focus on real estate mostly concentrating on building rental housing in the low income Eastlands area of Nairobi.

==Political career==
Kirima served for many years as a city councilor and briefly as deputy mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucat.iu.edu/iub/13727454|title=Makers of a nation. Gerishon Kirima the men and women in Kenya's history - IUCAT|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Starehe Constituency]] Member of Parliament Kiruhi Kimondo was dismissed by his party [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]] in 1989. By-elections were held the same year. Kirima contested the seat on a KANU ticket and won. He remained in office until the 1992 General Elections when he lost the seat to his predecessor Kimondo.

==Personal life==
Kirima had 3 wives, several children and many grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/539550-1081276-item-3-ankja9z/index.html|title=A frugal carpenters epic struggle to the helm of real estate fortune|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Diabetic and partially blind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/539550-1081276-item-2-ankjaaz/index.html|title=A frugal carpenters epic struggle to the helm of real estate fortune|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerishon Kirima died on 28 December 2010 while undergoing treatment in South Africa. He was 80 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/City-tycoon-Kirima-dies-in-SA-hospital-/1056-1080866-fnx74l/index.html|title=City tycoon Kirima dies in SA hospital|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hip Hop Since 1978''' (HHS78) was a [[management]] and [[record producer|production]] company based in [[New York City]]. It was started by Gee Roberson and Kyambo "Hip-Hop" Joshua. HHS78 has been involved in the daily operations of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] since the label's inception in the early 1990s. HHS78 originally signed [[Kanye West]] to their production and management company in 1998, and negotiated his signing to Roc-A-Fella Records. Hip Hop Since 1978's first official project was West's 2004 album, ''[[The College Dropout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200503/ai_n13485264l Hip Hop Since 1978 Principals G.

As a result, they managed the careers of [[Lil Wayne]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] and [[Nicki Minaj]] (who were signed to [[Young Money Entertainment|Young Money]]/[[Cash Money Records]]). In January 2009, Kyambo Joshua and Columbia Records parted ways.

'''Human genetic clustering''' is the degree to which [[human genetic variation]] can be partitioned into a small number of groups or clusters. A leading method of analysis uses mathematical [[cluster analysis]] of the degree of similarity of genetic data between individuals and groups in order to infer population structures and assign individuals to hypothesized ancestral groups. A similar analysis can be done using [[principal components analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = Nick | last2 = Price | first2 = Alkes L. | last3 = Reich | first3 = David | year = 2006| title = Population Structure and Eigenanalysis | url = | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 2 | issue = 12| page = e190 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020190 | pmid=17194218 | pmc=1713260}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several recent studies deploy both methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Analysis of genetic clustering examines the degree to which regional groups differ genetically, the categorization of individuals into clusters, and what can be learned about human ancestry from this data. There is broad scientific agreement that a relatively small fraction of human genetic variation occurs between populations, continents, or clusters. Researchers of genetic clustering differ, however, on whether genetic variation is principally [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] or whether clusters inferred mathematically are important and scientifically useful.

== Analysis of human genetic variation ==

=== Quantifying variation ===
One of the underlying questions regarding the distribution of human genetic diversity is related to the degree to which genes are shared between the observed clusters. It has been observed repeatedly that the majority of variation observed in the global human population is found within populations. This variation is usually calculated using [[Sewall Wright]]'s [[fixation index]] (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;), which is an estimate of between to within group variation. The degree of human genetic variation is a little different depending upon the gene type studied, but in general it is common to claim that ~85% of genetic variation is found within groups, ~6&amp;ndash;10% between groups within the same continent and ~6&amp;ndash;10% is found between continental groups. Ryan Brown and George Armelagos described this as "a host of studies [that have] concluded that racial classification schemes can account for only a negligible proportion of human genetic diversity," including the studies listed in the table below.

These average numbers, however, do not mean that every population harbors an equal amount of diversity. In fact, some human populations contain far more genetic diversity than others, which is consistent with the likely [[Recent African origin of modern humans|African origin]] of [[Anatomically modern human|modern humans]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Ghirotto|first2=S.|last3=Tassi|first3=F.|date=2013-09-01|title=Nine things to remember about human genome diversity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tan.12165/abstract|journal=Tissue Antigens|volume=82|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1111/tan.12165|issn=1399-0039|last1=Barbujani|first1=G.|accessdate=2015-12-02|pmid=24032721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Cabana|first2=Graciela S.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=2015-12-01|title=The apportionment of human diversity revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22899/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|pages=561–569|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22899|issn=1096-8644|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|accessdate=2016-01-23|volume=160|pmid=26619959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, populations outside of Africa may have undergone [[Founder effect|serial founder effects]] that limited their genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

W. F. Edwards]] [[Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy|faulted Lewontin's methodology]] for basing his conclusions on simple comparison of genes and rather on a more complex structure of gene frequencies. Long and Kittles' objection is also methodological: according to them the F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; is based on a faulty underlying assumptions that all populations contain equally genetic diverse members and that continental groups diverged at the same time. Sarich and Miele have also argued that estimates of genetic difference between individuals of different populations understate differences between groups because they fail to take into account human diploidy.&lt;ref&gt;Sarich VM, Miele F. Race: The Reality of Human Differences. Westview Press (2004). {{ISBN|0-8133-4086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Hunley, Graciela Cabana, and Jeffrey Long created a revised statistical model to account for unequally divergent population lineages and local populations with differing degrees of diversity. Their 2015 paper applies this model to the [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] sample of 1,037 individuals in 52 populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They found that least diverse population examined, the [[Surui people|Surui]], "harbors nearly 60% of the total species’ diversity." Long and Kittles had noted earlier that the Sokoto people of Africa contains virtually all of human genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kittles|first2=Rick A.|date=2009|title=Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_biology/v081/81.5-6.long.html|journal=Human Biology|volume=81|issue=5|pages=793–794|issn=1534-6617|last1=Long|first1=Jeffrey C.|accessdate=2016-01-13|doi=10.3378/027.081.0621|pmid=20504196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis also found that non-African populations are a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] subgroup of African populations, that "some African populations are equally related to other African populations and to non-African populations," and that "outside of Africa, regional groupings of populations are nested inside one another, and many of them are not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Edwards (2003) claims, "It is not true, as ''Nature'' claimed, that 'two random individuals from any one group are almost as different as any two random individuals from the entire world'" and Risch ''et al.'' (2002) state "Two Caucasians are more similar to each other genetically than a Caucasian and an Asian." However Bamshad et al. (2004) used the data from Rosenberg et al. (2002) to investigate the extent of genetic differences between individuals within continental groups relative to genetic differences between individuals between continental groups. They found that though these individuals could be classified very accurately to continental clusters, there was a significant degree of genetic overlap on the individual level, to the extent that, using 377 loci, individual Europeans were about 38% of the time more genetically similar to East Asians than to other Europeans.

Witherspoon et al. (2007) have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster, when sampling a small number of SNPs (as in the case with scientists James Watson, Craig Venter and Seong-Jin Kim). They state that using around one-thousand SNPs, individuals from different populations/clusters are '''never''' more similar, which they state some may find surprising. Witherspoon et al. conclude that "caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes".

== Blood polymorphism study ==
A 1994 study by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] and colleagues evaluated genetic distances among 42 native populations based on 120 blood polymorphisms. The populations were grouped into nine clusters: African (sub-Saharan), Caucasoid (European), Caucasoid (extra-European), northern Mongoloid (excluding Arctic populations), northeast Asian Arctic, southern Mongoloid (mainland and insular Southeast Asia), Pacific islander, New Guinean and Australian, and American (Amerindian). Although the clusters demonstrate varying degrees of homogeneity, the nine-cluster model represents a majority (80 out of 120) of single-trait trees and is useful in demonstrating the [[Phenetics|phenetic]] relationship among these populations.&lt;ref name="Cavalli-Sforza1994"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|last1=Cavalli-Sforza|first1=Luigi Luca|last2=Menozzi|first2=Paolo|last3=Piazza|first3=Alberto|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-08750-4|location=Princeton|ref=harv|authorlink1=Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=FrwNcwKaUKoC&amp;pg=PA349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest genetic distance between two continents is between Africa and [[Oceania]], at 0.2470. This measure of genetic distance reflects the isolation of Australia and New Guinea since the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when Oceania was isolated from mainland Asia due to rising sea levels. The next-largest genetic distance is between Africa and the Americas, at 0.2260. This is expected, since the longest geographic distance by land is between Africa and South America. The shortest genetic distance, 0.0155, is between European and extra-European Caucasoids. Africa is the most genetically divergent continent, with all other groups more related to each other than to sub-Saharan Africans. This is expected, according to the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|single-origin hypothesis]]. Europe has a general genetic variation about three times less than that of other continents; the genetic contribution of Asia and Africa to Europe is thought to be two-thirds and one-third, respectively.&lt;ref name="Cavalli-Sforza1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalli-Sforza1997"&gt;Genes, peoples, and languages, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1997, vol.94, pp.7719–7724, doi=10.1073/pnas.94.15.7719  http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/15/7719&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic cluster studies==

Individuals have genes from multiple clusters. The cluster prevalent only among the [[Kalash people|Kalash]] people (yellow) only splits off at K=7 and greater.]]
Genetic structure studies are carried out using statistical computer programs designed to find clusters of genetically similar individuals within a sample of individuals. Studies such as those by Risch and [[Noah Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] use a computer program called STRUCTURE to find human populations (gene clusters). It is a statistical program that works by placing individuals into one of an arbitrary number of clusters based on their overall genetic similarity, many possible pairs of clusters are tested per individual to generate multiple clusters.&lt;ref name="Witherspoon"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wooding|first2=S.|last3=Rogers|first3=A.R.|last4=Marchani|first4=E.E.|last5=Watkins|first5=W.S.|last6=Batzer|first6=M.A.|last7=Jorde|first7=L.B.|year=2007|title=Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations|url=|journal=Genetics|volume=176|issue=1|pages=351–359|doi=10.1534/genetics.106.067355|pmc=1893020|pmid=17339205|last1=Witherspoon|first1=D.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for these computations are data describing a large number of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), genetic insertions and deletions ([[indel]]s), [[Microsatellite|microsatellite markers]] (or short tandem repeats, STRs) as they appear in each sampled individual. [[Cluster analysis]] divides a dataset into any prespecified number of clusters.

These clusters are based on multiple genetic markers that are often shared between different human populations even over large geographic ranges. The notion of a genetic cluster is that people within the cluster share on average similar allele frequencies to each other than to those in other clusters. ([[A. W. F. Edwards]], 2003 but see also infobox "Multi Locus Allele Clusters") In a test of idealised populations, the computer programme STRUCTURE was found to consistently underestimate the numbers of populations in the data set when high migration rates between populations and slow mutation rates (such as [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s) were considered.&lt;ref name="population?"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gaggiotti|first2=O.|year=2006|title=What is a population?

In a 2005 paper, Rosenberg and his team acknowledged that findings of a study on human population structure are highly influenced by the way the study is designed.&lt;ref name="roberts1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Clines, Clusters, and the Effects of Study Design on the Inference of Human Population Science|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=1|pages=660, 668|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070|pmc=1310579|pmid=16355252|author1=Noah A. Rosenberg|author2=Saurabh Mahajan|author3=Sohini Ramachandran|author4=Chengfeng Zhao|author5=Jonathan K. Pritchard|author6=Marcus Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reported that the number of loci, the sample size, the geographic dispersion of the samples and assumptions about allele-frequency correlation all have an effect on the outcome of the study.

In a review of studies of human genome diversity, Guido Barbujani and colleagues note that various cluster studies have identified different numbers of clusters with different boundaries. They write that discordant patterns of genetic variation and high within-population genetic diversity "make[] it difficult, or impossible, to define, once and for good, the main genetic clusters of humankind."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic clustering was also criticized by Penn State anthropologists Kenneth Weiss and Brian Lambert. They asserted that understanding human population structure in terms of discrete genetic clusters misrepresents the path that produced diverse human populations that diverged from shared ancestors in Africa. Ironically, by ignoring the way population history actually works as one process from a common origin rather than as a string of creation events, structure analysis that seems to present variation in Darwinian evolutionary terms is fundamentally non-Darwinian."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2010|title=Does History Matter?

=== Clusters by [[Noah Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] et al. (2002, 2005) ===
{{see also|Race and genetics}}A major finding of Rosenberg and colleagues (2002) was that when five clusters were generated by the program (specified as K=5), "clusters corresponded largely to major geographic regions." Specifically, the five clusters corresponded to Africa, Europe plus the Middle East plus Central and South Asia, East Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. The study also confirmed prior analyses by showing that, "Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%."[[File:Rosenberg 1048people 993markers.jpg|thumb|right|Human population structure can be inferred from multilocus DNA sequence data ([[Noah Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] et al. 2002, 2005). Individuals from 52 populations were examined at 993 DNA markers. This data was used to partition individuals into K = 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 gene clusters. In this figure, the average fractional membership of individuals from each population is represented by horizontal bars partitioned into K colored segments.]]
Rosenberg and colleagues (2005) have argued, based on cluster analysis, that populations do not always vary continuously and a population's genetic structure is consistent if enough genetic markers (and subjects) are included. "Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions." They also wrote, regarding a model with five clusters corresponding to Africa, Eurasia (Europe, Middle East, and Central/South Asia), East Asia, Oceania, and the Americas: "For population pairs from the same cluster, as geographic distance increases, genetic distance increases in a linear manner, consistent with a clinal population structure. However, for pairs from different clusters, genetic distance is generally larger than that between intracluster pairs that have the same geographic distance. For example, genetic distances for population pairs with one population in Eurasia and the other in East Asia are greater than those for pairs at equivalent geographic distance within Eurasia or within East Asia. Loosely speaking, it is these small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance—across [[ocean]]s, the [[Himalaya]]s, and the [[Sahara]]—that provide the basis for the ability of STRUCTURE to identify clusters that correspond to geographic regions".&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenberg NA, Mahajan S, Ramachandran S, Zhao C, [[Jonathan K. Pritchard|Pritchard JK]], Feldman MW |title=Clines, Clusters, and the Effect of Study Design on the Inference of Human Population Structure |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=e70 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16355252 |pmc=1310579 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg stated that their findings "should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race (...). Genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive 'diagnostic' genotypes."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The study's overall results confirmed that genetic difference within populations is between 93 and 95%. Only 5% of genetic variation is found between groups.&lt;ref name="roberts1" /&gt;

====Criticism====

The Rosenberg study has been criticised on several grounds.

The existence of allelic clines and the observation that the bulk of human variation is continuously distributed, has led some scientists to conclude that any categorization schema attempting to partition that variation meaningfully will necessarily create artificial truncations. (Kittles &amp; Weiss 2003). It is for this reason, Reanne Frank argues, that attempts to allocate individuals into ancestry groupings based on genetic information have yielded varying results that are highly dependent on methodological design.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;[http://paa2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=61713 Back with a Vengeance: the Reemergence of a Biological Conceptualization of Race in Research on Race/Ethnic Disparities in Health Reanne Frank]&lt;/ref&gt; Serre and Pääbo (2004) make a similar claim:{{quotation|The absence of strong continental clustering in the human gene pool is of practical importance. It has recently been claimed that "the greatest genetic structure that exists in the human population occurs at the racial level" (Risch et al. 2002). Our results show that this is not the case, and we see no reason to assume that "races" represent any units of relevance for understanding human genetic history.}}

In a response to Serre and Pääbo (2004), Rosenberg ''et al.'' (2005) maintain that their clustering analysis is robust. Additionally, they agree with Serre and Pääbo that membership of multiple clusters can be interpreted as evidence for clinality (isolation by distance), though they also comment that this may also be due to admixture between neighbouring groups (small island model). Thirdly they comment that evidence of clusterdness is not evidence for any concepts of "biological race".&lt;ref name="rosenberg2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = NA | authorlink5 = Jonathan K.

Clustering does not particularly correspond to continental divisions. Depending on the parameters given to their analytical program, Rosenberg and Pritchard were able to construct between divisions of between 4 and 20 clusters of the genomes studied, although they excluded analysis with more than 6 clusters from their published article. Probability values for various cluster configurations varied widely, with the single most likely configuration coming with 16 clusters although other 16-cluster configurations had low probabilities. Overall, "there is no clear evidence that K=6 was the best estimate" according to geneticist Deborah Bolnick (2008:76-77).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 978-0-8135-4324-6 | editor1-last = Koenig | editor1-first = Barbara A. | editor2-last = Richardson | editor2-first = Sarah S. | editor3-last = Lee | editor3-first = Sandra Soo-Jin | last = Bolnick | first = Deborah A. | title = Revisiting race in a genomic age | chapter = Individual Ancestry Inference and the Reification of Race as a Biological Phenomenon | year = 2008 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of genetic clusters used in the study was arbitrarily chosen. Although the original research used different number of clusters, the published study emphasized six genetic clusters. The number of genetic clusters is determined by the user of the computer software conducting the study. Rosenberg later revealed that his team used pre-conceived numbers of genetic clusters from six to twenty "but did not publish those results because Structure [the computer program used] identified multiple ways to divide the sampled individuals".  Dorothy Roberts, a law professor, asserts that "there is nothing in the team's findings that suggests that six clusters represent human population structure better than ten, or fifteen, or twenty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalinowski|title=The Computer Program STRUCTURE Does Not Reliably Identify Main Genetic Clusters Within Species|volume=4|pages=67–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; When instructed to find two clusters, the program identified two populations anchored around by Africa and by the Americas.

Commenting on Rosenberg's study, law professor Dorothy Roberts wrote that "the study actually showed that there are many ways to slice the expansive range of human genetic variation.

=== Clusters in Tishkoff et al. 2009 ===
Sarah A. Tishkoff and colleagues analyzed a global sample consisting of 952 individuals from the HGDP-CEPH survey, 2432 Africans from 113 ethnic groups, 98 African Americans, 21 Yemenites, 432 individuals of Indian descent, and 10 Native Australians. A global STRUCTURE analysis of these individuals examined 1327 polymorphic markers, including of 848 STRs, 476 indels, and 3 SNPs. The authors reported cluster results for K=2 to K=14. Within Africa, six ancestral clusters were inferred through Bayesian analysis, which were closely linked with ethnolinguistic heritage. [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] populations grouped with other [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking populations from West Africa. African Americans largely belonged to this Niger-Congo cluster, but also had significant European ancestry. [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] populations formed their own cluster. [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] populations clustered with the Nilo-Saharan groups, suggesting that most present-day Chadic speakers originally spoke languages from the Nilo-Saharan family and later adopted Afro-Asiatic languages. [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations from the [[African Great Lakes]] largely belonged to this Nilo-Saharan cluster too, but also had some Afro-Asiatic influence due to assimilation of [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] groups over the last 3,000 years. [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] populations formed their own cluster, which grouped closest with the [[Congo Pygmies|Pygmy]] cluster. The Cape [[Coloured]] showed assignments from the Khoisan, European and other clusters due to the population's mixed heritage. The [[Hadza people|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] populations formed their own cluster. An [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] cluster was also discerned, with the Afro-Asiatic speakers from [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]] forming a contiguous group. Afro-Asiatic speakers in the Great Lakes region largely belonged to this Afro-Asiatic cluster as well, but also had some Bantu and Nilotic influence due to assimilation of adjacent groups over the last 3,000 years. The remaining inferred ancestral clusters were associated with European, Middle Eastern, Oceanian, Indian, Native American and East Asian populations.&lt;ref&gt;Supporting Online Material for {{Cite journal|last2=Reed|first2=Floyd A|last3=Friedlaender|first3=Françoise R|last4=Ehret|first4=Christopher|last5=Ranciaro|first5=Alessia|last6=Froment|first6=Alain|last7=Hirbo|first7=Jibril B|last8=Awomoyi|first8=Agnes A|last9=Bodo|first9=Jean-Marie|date=2009-05-22|title=The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5930|pages=1035–1044|doi=10.1126/science.1172257|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2947357|last1=Tishkoff|first1=Sarah A|last10=Doumbo|first10=Ogobara|last11=Ibrahim|first11=Muntaser|last12=Juma|first12=Abdalla T|last13=Kotze|first13=Maritha J|last14=Lema|first14=Godfrey|last15=Moore|first15=Jason H|last16=Mortensen|first16=Holly|last17=Nyambo|first17=Thomas B|last18=Omar|first18=Sabah A|last19=Powell|first19=Kweli|last20=Pretorius|first20=Gideon S|last21=Smith|first21=Michael W|last22=Thera|first22=Mahamadou A|last23=Wambebe|first23=Charles|last24=Weber|first24=James L|last25=Williams|first25=Scott M|pmid=19407144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examining effects of sampling in Xing et al. 2010 ===
Jinchuan Xing and colleagues used an alternate dataset of human genotypes including HapMap samples and their own samples (296 new individuals from 13 populations), for a total of 40 populations distributed roughly evenly across the Earth's land surface. They found that the alternate sampling reduced the F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; estimate of inter-population differences from 0.18 to 0.11, suggesting that the higher number may be an artifact of uneven sampling. They conducted a cluster analysis using the ADMIXTURE program and found that "genetic diversity is distributed in a more clinal pattern when more geographically intermediate populations are sampled."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===HUGO Asian study  ===
A study by the HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium in 2009 using the similar principal components analysis found that East Asian and South-East Asian populations clustered together, and suggested a common origin for these populations. At the same time they observed a broad discontinuity between this cluster and South Asia, commenting "most of the Indian populations showed evidence of shared ancestry with European populations". It was noted that "genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography".&lt;ref name="HUGO-Asia"&gt;[http://www.humpopgenfudan.cn/p/A/A1.pdf Mapping Human Genetic Diversity in Asia], The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy of genetic clustering and associations with "race"==

Studies of clustering reopened a debate on the scientific reality of race, or lack thereof. In the late 1990s Harvard evolutionary geneticist [[Richard Lewontin]] stated that "no justification can be offered for continuing the biological concept of [[Race (human classification)|race]]. (...) Genetic data shows that no matter how racial groups are defined, two people from the same racial group are about as different from each other as two people from any two different racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/gvt/ombdraft.htm |title=Response to OMB Directive 15 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been affirmed by numerous authors&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and the American Association of Physical Anthropologists since.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A.W.F. Edwards as well as Rick Kittles and Jeffrey Long have criticized Lewontin's methodology, with Long noting that there are more similarities between humans and chimpanzees than differences, and more genetic variation within chimps and humans than between them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Edwards also charged that Lewontin made an "unjustified assault on human classification, which he deplored for social reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy|journal=BioEssays|volume=25|issue=8|pages=798–801|doi=10.1002/bies.10315|pmid=12879450|author=A.W.F. Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2015 article, Keith Hunley, Graciela Cabana, and Jeffrey Long recalculate the apportionment of human diversity using a more complex model than Lewontin and his successors. They conclude: "In sum, we concur with Lewontin’s conclusion that Western-based racial classifications have no taxonomic significance, and we hope that this research, which takes into account our current understanding of the structure of human diversity, places his seminal finding on firmer evolutionary footing."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Genetic clustering studies, and particularly the five-cluster result published by Rosenberg's team in 2002, have been interpreted by journalist Nicholas Wade, evolutionary biologist Armand Marie Leroi, and others as demonstrating the biological reality of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=2015-04-28|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-312716-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raff|first=Jennifer|date=1 July 2014|title=Nicholas Wade and Race: Building a Scientific Façade|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.13110/humanbiology.86.3.0227|journal=Human Biology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=227–232|doi=10.13110/humanbiology.86.3.0227|issn=0018-7143|access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Leroi/|title=A Family Tree in Every Gene|last=Leroi|first=Armand Marie|date=14 March 2005|work=New York Times|access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Leroi, "Race is merely a shorthand that enables us to speak sensibly, though with no great precision, about genetic rather than cultural or political differences." He states that, "One could sort the world's population into 10, 100, perhaps 1,000 groups", and describes Europeans, Basques, Andaman Islanders, Ibos, and Castillians each as a "race".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In response to Leroi's claims, the Social Science Research Council convened a panel of experts to discuss race and genomics online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/|title=Is Race "Real"?|last=[[Social Science Research Council]]|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2002 and 2005 papers, Rosenberg and colleagues disagree that their data implies the biological reality of race.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenberg2005" /&gt;

In 2006, Lewontin wrote that any genetic study requires some priori concept of race or ethnicity in order to package human genetic diversity into a defined, limited number of biological groupings. Informed by genetics, zoologists have long discarded the concept of race for dividing groups of non-human animal populations within a species. Defined on varying criteria, in the same species a widely varying number of races could be distinguished. Lewontin notes that genetic testing revealed that "because so many of these races turned out to be based on only one or two genes, two animals born in the same litter could belong to different 'races'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Lewontin |title=Confusion About Human Races |publisher=Social Science Research Council |date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that seek to find genetic clusters are only as informative as the populations they sample. For example, Risch and Burchard relied on two or three local populations from five continents, which together were supposed to represent the entire human race.&lt;ref name="roberts1"/&gt; Another genetic clustering study used three sub-Saharan population groups to represent Africa; Chinese, Japanese, and Cambodian samples for East Asia; Northern European and Northern Italian samples to represent "Caucasians". Entire regions, subcontinents, and landmasses are left out of many studies. Furthermore, social geographical categories such "East Asia" and "Caucasians" were not defined. "A handful of ethnic groups to symbolize an entire continent mimic a basic tenet of racial thinking: that because races are composed of uniform individuals, anyone can represent the whole group" notes Roberts.&lt;ref name="roberts1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Charles N.

The model of Big Few fails when including overlooked geographical regions such as India.

The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] (HGDP) relied on samples which were assumed to be geographically separate and isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reardon |first=Jenny |title= Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in the Age of Genomics |year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively small sample sizes of indigenous populations for the HGDP do not represent the human species' genetic diversity, nor do they portray migrations and mixing population groups which has been happening since prehistoric times. Geographic areas such as the Balkans, the Middle East, North and East Africa, and Spain are seldom included in genetic studies.&lt;ref name=roberts1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves |first=Joseph |title=The Race Myth |year=2004|publisher=Dutton |location=New York|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; East and North African indigenous populations, for example, are never selected to represent Africa because they do not fit the profile of "black" Africa. The sampled indigenous populations of the HGDP are assumed to be "pure"; the law professor Roberts claims that "their unusual purity is all the more reason they cannot stand in for all the other populations of the world that marked by intermixture from migration, commerce, and conquest."&lt;ref name=roberts1/&gt;

King and Motulsky, in a 2002 ''Science'' article, state that "While the computer-generated findings from all of these studies offer greater insight into the genetic unity and diversity of the human species, as well as its ancient migratory history, none support dividing the species into discrete, genetically determined racial categories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Mary-Claire King |author2=Arno G.

Bamshad, in 2004 paper published in ''Nature'', asserts that a more accurate study of human genetic variation would use an objective sampling method, which would choose populations randomly and systematically across the world, including those populations which are characterized by historical intermingling, instead of [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]] population samples which fit a priori concepts of racial classification.

Anthropologists such as [[C. Loring Brace]],&lt;ref name="university"&gt;Loring Brace, C. 2005. ''Race is a four letter word''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Kaplan, Jonathan Michael (January 2011) 'Race': What Biology Can Tell Us about a Social Construct. In: Encyclopedia of Life Sciences (ELS). John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd: Chichester&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2011) ¿La cosificación genética de la 'raza'? Un análisis crítico in C López-Beltrán (ed.) ''Genes (&amp;) Mestizos. Genómica y raza en la biomedicina mexicana''. Ficticia editorial http://philpapers.org/archive/WINLCG.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jonathan Michael, Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2012). Prisoners of Abstraction? The Theory and Measure of Genetic Variation, and the Very Concept of 'Race' ''Biological Theory'' 7 http://philpapers.org/archive/KAPPOA.14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]],&lt;ref name="university8"&gt;Graves, Joseph. 2001. ''The Emperor's New Clothes''. Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that while it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as "continental races", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.&lt;ref name="evolutionary"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = KM | last2 = Fullerton | first2 = SM | year = 2005 | title = Racing around, getting nowhere | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 165–169 | doi=10.1002/evan.20079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that seen in this way both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that cross-cut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data under-determines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998 &lt;ref&gt;Mills CW (1988) "But What Are You Really? The Metaphysics of Race" in ''Blackness visible: essays on philosophy and race'', pp. 41–66. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt;) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons.

===Commercial ancestry testing and individual ancestry===

Commercial ancestry testing companies, who use genetic clustering data, have been also heavily criticized. Limitations of genetic clustering are intensified when inferred population structure is applied to individual ancestry. The type of statistical analysis conducted by scientists translates poorly into individual ancestry because they are looking at difference in frequencies, not absolute differences between groups. Commercial genetic genealogy companies are guilty of what Pillar Ossorio calls the "tendency to transform statistical claims into categorical ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pillar Ossorio |title=Race, Genetic Variation, and the Haplotype Mapping Project |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=66 |issue=131, 141 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not just individuals of the same local ethnic group, but two siblings may end up beings as members of different continental groups or "races" depending on the alleles they inherit.&lt;ref name=roberts1/&gt;

Many commercial companies use data from the [[International HapMap Project]] (HapMap)'s initial phrase, where population samples were collected from four ethnic groups in the world: Han Chinese, Japanese, Yoruba Nigerian, and Utah residents of Northern European ancestry. If a person has ancestry from a region where the computer program does not have samples, it will compensate with the closest sample that may have nothing to do with the customer's actual ancestry: "Consider a genetic ancestry testing performed on an individual we will call Joe, whose eight great-grandparents were from southern Europe. The HapMap populations are used as references for testing Joe's genetic ancestry. The HapMap's European samples consist of "northern" Europeans. In regions of Joe's genome that vary between northern and southern Europe (such regions might include the lactase gene), the genetic ancestry test is using the HapMap reference population is likely to incorrectly assign the ancestry of that portion of the genome to a non-European population because that genomic region will appear to be more similar to the HapMap's [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] or [[Han Chinese]] samples than to Northern European samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Royal, Novembre, Fullerton|title=Inferring Genetic Ancestry|issue=667–68|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a person having Western European and Western African ancestries may have ancestors from Western Europe and West Africa, or instead be assigned to East Africa where various ancestries can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark D.|first=Shriver|author2=Rick A. Kittles|title=Genetic Ancestry and the Search for Personalized Genetic Histories|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2004|volume=5|pages=611–8 |doi=10.1038/nrg1405|pmid=15266343}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Telling customers that they are a composite of several anthropological groupings reinforces three central myths about race: that there are pure races, that each race contains people who are fundamentally the same and fundamentally different from people in other races, and that races can be biologically demarcated." Many companies base their findings on inadequate and unscientific sampling methods. Researchers have never sampled the world's populations in a systematic and random fashion.&lt;ref name="roberts1"/&gt;

===Geographical and continental groupings===

Roberts argues against the use of broad geographical or continental groupings: "molecular geneticists routinely refer to African ancestry as if everyone on the continent is more similar to each other than they are to people of other continents, who may be closer both geographically and genetically.&lt;ref name=roberts1/&gt; [[Ethiopia]]ns have closer genetic affinity with [[Armenians]] than with [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng761 |year=2001 |last1=Wilson |first1=James F. |last2=Weale |first2=Michael E. |last3=Smith |first3=Alice C. |last4=Gratrix |first4=Fiona |last5=Fletcher |first5=Benjamin |last6=Thomas |first6=Mark G. |last7=Bradman |first7=Neil |last8=Goldstein |first8=David B. |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=29 |pages=265–69 |pmid=11685208 |title=Population genetic structure of variable drug response |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Somali people|Somalis]] are genetically more similar to [[Arabian peninsula|Gulf Arab]] populations than to other populations in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohamoud|first=A. M.|title=P52 Characteristics of HLA Class I and Class II Antigens of the Somali Population|journal=Transfusion Medicine|date=October 2006|volume=16|issue=Supplement s1|page=47|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2006.00694_52.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braun and Hammonds (2008) asserts that the misperception of continents as natural population groupings is rooted in the assumption that populations are natural, isolated, and static. Populations came to be seen as "bounded units amenable to scientific sampling, analysis, and classification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braun|first=Lundy|author2=Evelynn Hammonds|title=Race, Populations, and Genomics: Africa as Laboratory|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2008|volume=67|pages=1580–8|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.07.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings are not naturally organized into definable, genetically cohesive populations.

The '''International Council of Chemical Associations''' ('''ICCA''') is the [[trade association]] of the global [[chemical industry]]. Its members are both regional trade associations like [[CEFIC]] or the [[Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association]], and also national associations including the [[American Chemistry Council]].

According to its own figures, ICCA represents chemical companies which account for more than 75% of the global production capacities, making more than US$1.6 trillion in revenues each year.

ICCA is the steward of [[Responsible Care]], a voluntary scheme to improve chemical safety among its members. Responsible Care had been launched by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada in 1985. At the 2006 [[International Conference on Chemicals Management]], Responsible Care was extended through a [[Global Product Strategy]] and a [[Global Charter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1344">'''Java Data Mining''' ('''JDM''') is a standard [[Java API]] for developing [[data mining]] applications and tools. JDM defines an object model and Java API for data mining objects and processes. JDM enables applications to integrate data mining technology for developing [[predictive analytics]] applications and tools.  The JDM 1.0 standard was developed under the [[Java Community Process]] as JSR 73.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=73 JSR 73] (JDM 1.0)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the JDM 2.0 specification was being developed under JSR 247, but has been withdrawn in 2011 without standardization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=247 JSR 247] (JDM 2.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

Various data mining functions and techniques like [[statistical classification]] and [[association (statistics)|association]], [[regression analysis]], [[data clustering]], and attribute importance are covered by the 1.0 release of this standard.

It never received wide acceptance, and there is no known implementation.

== Biography ==

A native of the [[United States]], Jere R. Behrman earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in physics from [[Williams College]] in 1962, followed by a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1966 for a thesis on the dynamics of the supply of crops in [[Thailand]] between 1937 and 1963. Already before his graduation, Behrman began working at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], with which he has been affiliated throughout his academic career, first as an assistant professor of economics (1965–68), then as associate professor (1968–71), and finally as full professor (since 1971); in 1983, Behrman was honoured with the William R. Kenan, Jr. professorship in economics. At the University of Pennsylvania, Behrman additionally serves as an associate director of the Population Aging Research Center,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pop.upenn.edu/bio/jere-r-behrman Profile of Jere Behrman at the Population Studies Center. Retrieved February 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a faculty fellow at the Center for the Advanced Study of India, and a research associate at the Population Studies Center, among else. In the past, he has served as director of the Center for Analysis of Developing Economies (1982–95), director of the Population Aging Research Center (1998–99), and director of the Population Studies Center (1998-2005), and chaired the Department of Economics of the University of Pennsylvania (1973–79). Moreover, Behrman performs or has performed editorial duties for the ''[[Journal of Development Economics]]'', ''[[Demography (journal)|Demography]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Econometrics]]'', ''[[International Organization (journal|International Organization]]'', ''[[International Economic Review]]'', ''[[Economics of Education Review]]'', ''[[Asian Development Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Asian Economies]]'', ''[[Journal of Development Studies]]'', ''[[Educational Economics (journal)|Educational Economics]]'', and the ''[[IZA World of Labor]]''. Finally, he has also worked as consultant for numerous international organizations, including the [[World Bank]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]], [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]], [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], and the [[Department for International Development|DfID]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/sites/economics.sas.upenn.edu/files/Behrman%20CV%208-2017.pdf Curriculum vitae of Jere Behrman from the website of the University of Pennsylvania.

== Research ==

Jere Behrman's research revolves around the empirical determinants and impacts of human resources such as [[early childhood development]], [[education]], [[health]] and [[nutrition]] in the presence of unobserved factors (e.g. innate ability or health), the [[family economics|economics of households]] and [[imperfect market]]s, and the economic consequences of [[imperfect information]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/faculty/jere-behrman Profile of Jere Behrman on the website of the University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved February 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, a substantial part of Behrman's research involves [[twin study|twin studies]]. According to [[IDEAS/RePEc]], he belongs to the 1% of highest ranked economists worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pbe285 Ranking of economists on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved February 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The economics of households ===

After early work in [[agricultural economics|agricultural]] and [[international economics]] in developing countries, Behrman turned towards the analysis of households' economic decisions in the mid-1970s. In this area, together with [[Robert Pollak]] and [[Paul Taubman]], Behrman developed a model for the analysis of parental allocations of resources among their children and finds evidence that [[United States|U.S. American]] parents address inequality in their children's earnings by providing more resources to their less able children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v90y1982i1p52-73.html Behrman, J.R., Pollak, R.A., Taubman, P. (1982). Parental Preferences and Provision for Progeny. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 90(1), pp. 52-73.]&lt;/ref&gt; Studying whether and how children's order of birth affects how much resources their parents give them, Behrman and Taubman find that parents in the [[United States]] give more to firstborns, possibly because of endowment effects, even though they tend to favour later-borns. These differences are then reflected in the relationship between children's birth order and their (age-adjusted) schooling and earnings as young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jlabec/v4y1986i3ps121-45.html Behrman, J.R., Taubman, P. (1986). Birth Order, Schooling, and Earnings. ''Journal of Labor Economics'', 4(3), pp. 121-145.]&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the distribution of food among children within households in rural South India, Behrman finds that parents give preference to their sons when food is scarce, especially among lower caste households, and display only limited aversion for such inequality, thus suggesting that girls may be particularly vulnerable to malnutrition during famines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/oxecpp/v40y1988i1p32-54.html Behrman, J.R. (1988). Intrahousehold Allocation of Nutrients in Rural India: Are Boys Favored? Do Parents Exhibit Inequality Aversion? ''Oxford Economic Papers'', 40(1), pp. 32-54.]&lt;/ref&gt; Using data from rural [[Pakistan]], Behrman, [[Harold Alderman]], [[Victor Lavy]] and Rekha Menon analyse the relationship between child health and school enrollment while explicitly modeling child health as determined by household choices in response to unobserved factors such as children's health endowments and find child health (proxied by nutrition) is three times as important for enrollment under that specification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v36y2001i1p185-205.html Alderman, H. et al. (2001). Child Health and School Enrollment: A Longitudinal Analysis. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 36(1), pp. 185-205.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using twin experiments, Behrman, Taubman and [[Mark Rosenzweig (economist)|Mark Rosenzweig]] find that 27% of the variance in income and 42% of the variance in obesity between individuals in the [[United States]] can be explained by individuals' unique endowments. The effect of these individual endowments are further reinforced through schooling, though somewhat diluted as men with high individual endowments tend to marry less educated wives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v102y1994i6p1131-74.html Behrman, J.R., Rosenzweig, M.R., Taubman, P. (1994). Endowments and the Allocation of Schooling in the Family and in the Marriage Market: The Twins Experiment. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 102(6), pp. 1131-1174.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study using twins, Behrman and Rosenzweig find that increasing the schooling of women doesn't increase the schooling of their children once heritable ability and [[sorting|assortative matching]] are taken into account, and instead reduces the time mothers spent at home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v92y2002i1p323-334.html Behrman, J.R., Rosenzweig, M.R. (2002). Does Increasing Women's Schooling Raise the Schooling in the Next Generation? ''American Economic Review'', 92(1), pp. 923-334.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The determinants and impacts of education, health and nutrition ===

Behrman's research on the determinants and impacts of education, health and nutrition (mostly in [[Latin America]]) began in the early 1980s. One early theme revolves around nutrition, what it is affected by, and how it in turn affects health, education and earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v11y1982i2p163-193.html Wolfe, B.L., Behrman, J.R. (1982). Determinants of Child Mortality, Health and Nutrition in a Developing Country. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 11(2), pp. 163-193.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using evidence from south [[India]], Behrman and Anil Deolalikar investigate the relationship between nutrition and income growth and find that the consumption of nutrients is essentially unresponsive to increases in income, even though food expenditure increases more or less in line with income; they conclude that as the poor grow richer, they tend to spend their income on more expensive nutrients rather than simply on more nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v95y1987i3p492-507.html Behrman, J.R., Deolalikar, A.B. (1987). Will Developing Country Nutrition Improve with Income? A Case Study for Rural South India. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 95(3), pp. 492-507.]&lt;/ref&gt; Behrman's work on the relationship between health and nutrition in developing countries also features prominently in his and Deolalikar's review of the corresponding literature in the ''Handbook of Development Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/devchp/1-14.html Behrman, J.R., Deolalikar, A.B. (1988). Chapter 14: Health and Nutrition. In: Chenery, H., Srinivasan, T.N. (eds.). ''Handbook of Development Economics'', vol. 1. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 631-711.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, though Behrman has called for the provision of public services to improve the health (and nutrition) of poor children based on the conclusion that child health likely has "considerable" effects on adult labour productivity by e.g. improving education, he repeatedly emphasized that the methodological weakness of the literature on the impact of health and nutrition on education (e.g. regarding [[reverse causality]]) prevented broader conclusions and called for more research on this issue (in the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbrobs/v11y1996i1p23-37.html Behrman, J.R. (1996). The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education. ''World Bank Research Observer'', 11(1), pp. 23-37.]&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this call, Behrman and Rosenzweig offer evidence that returns in terms of adult schooling attainment (and partly also in terms of higher earnings) to increasing birthweight are high, being underestimated by up to 50% if genetics and family background aren't controlled for. However, they also find that differences in birthweights don't play a large role in determining the world distribution of income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v86y2004i2p586-601.html#download Behrman, J.R., Rosenzweig, M.R. (2004). Returns to Birthweight. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 86(2), pp. 586-601.]&lt;/ref&gt; Last, evaluating the impact of improving nutrition during early childhood on education among adults in [[Guatemala]], Behrman, Maluccio, Hoddinott, [[Reynaldo Martorell|Martorell]], Quisumbing and Stein find that doing so increased the average number of grades completed by women by 1.2 grades as well as both male and female reading comprehension and non-verbal cognitive ability by one quarter standard deviation, thus suggesting that improvements to the nutrient intakes of very young children can have substantial long-term educational impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v119y2009i537p734-763.html Maluccio, J.A. et al. (2009). The Impact of Improving Nutrition During Early Childhood on Education among Guatemalan Adults. ''Economic Journal'', 119(537), pp. 734-763.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a theme often related to nutrition and health, Behrman has conducted research on the determinants and impacts of education, especially in Latin America. One of the most cited examples of such research is his and [[Nancy Birdsall]]'s critique of education economics' focus on the quantity of schooling at the detriment of schooling's quality. Using evidence on the returns to schooling for young [[Brazil|Brazilian]] men, they find that accounting for differences in the quality of schooling reduces these returns by half, thus suggesting that the social returns to investments into schooling quality may even exceed those to investments into schooling quantity. Moreover, Behrman and Birdsall find that variation in schooling quality partly explains variation in returns to schooling over space and among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v73y1983i5p928-46.html Behrman, J.R., Birdsall, N. (1983). The Quality of Schooling: Quantity Alone is Misleading. ''American Economic Review'', 73(5), pp. 928-946.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in a prominent programme evaluation, Behrman, Piyali Sengupta and [[Petra Todd]] find that the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[conditional cash transfer]] programme PROGRESA, wherein transfers are conditional upon children regularly attending school, effectively reduced dropout rates and facilitates grade progression, especially from primary to secondary school, and thereby increased schooling attainment by on average 0.7 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/ecdecc/y2005v54i1p237-75.html Behrman, J., Sengupta, P., Todd, P. (2005). Progressing through PROGRESA: An Impact Assessment of a School Subsidy Experiment in Rural Mexico. '' Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 54(1), pp. 237-275.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10294">'''Klaus Heymann''' (born 22 October 1936) is a German entrepreneur and the founder and head of the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] record label.

== Biography and career ==
Heymann was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], and studied Romance languages and English at the Universities of [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] and [[University of Lisbon (1911–2013)|Lisbon]], at [[King's College London]] and finally at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris. To pay his way through university he worked as a tennis coach. He worked in advertising sales and special supplement production for an American newspaper in his native Frankfurt, then worked in international marketing for [[Braun (company)|Braun AG]]. He first went to [[Hong Kong]] in 1967 to start up the office of the [[Overseas Weekly]], the American newspaper he had worked for in Frankfurt. He "arrived with a suitcase and a typewriter, and strangely enough the hotel which had been booked for me didn't exist anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/40251/hongkonger-klaus-heymann.html |title=Time Out Hong Kong &amp;#124; Big Smog &amp;#124; Hong Kong news, current affairs, politics and social issues &amp;#124; Hongkonger: Klaus Heymann |publisher=Timeout.com.hk |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently created a direct-mail advertising business, then a mail-order company providing goods to members of the [[United States military]] in [[Vietnam]]. He sold such items as cameras, watches and audio equipment, including [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] speakers and [[Revox]] tape recorders.

Following the end of the war in Vietnam, Heymann became the Hong Kong distributor for Bose and Revox, and, later, [[Studer]] recording studio equipment. He began organizing classical music concerts to help boost the sales of the brands he sold. When Heymann found that many of the musicians who performed at these concerts could not find their recordings in Hong Kong record shops, he started importing a number of classical record labels, including [[Vox Records|Vox]]-Turnabout, [[Hungaroton]], [[Supraphon]] and [[Opus Records]], for his company Studer-Revox (Hong Kong) to be later renamed Pacific Music. Heymann was asked to join the board of the then amateur [[Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1973, and helped this orchestra become a full-time professional orchestra in 1974. At this time, he also met his future wife, Japanese violinist [[Takako Nishizaki]], who came to play as soloist with the Hong Kong Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=klaus |title=About Klaus Heymann of Naxos Global Distribution Ltd |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann's desire to help his wife's career led him to start making her recordings including that of the Chinese ''[[Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto]]'' with the [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Since 1978, it sold several hundred thousand copies legitimately and millions in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=recordings |title=Naxos First Recordings |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this unexpected success, Heymann created a label called HK to record other works with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]]. At the same time, he began to import and license music from pop labels such as [[RCA]], [[Arista Records|Arista]], [[Virgin Records]], [[Chrysalis Records]] and others.

While Heymann was successful selling records of Asian music, he wanted to record rare works, and decided to create the Marco Polo label to do this.&lt;ref name="Soames2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolas Soames|title=The Story Of Naxos: The extraordinary story of the independent record label that changed classical recording for ever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlg5DPfjkNAC&amp;pg=PT32|date=3 May 2012|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-3110-5|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially recording in Hong Kong and Singapore, Heymann switched to eastern European countries, profiting from his connections with the Hungaroton and Opus labels, located in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he distributed.

In 1987, Heymann founded the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] label, with the goal of selling budget-priced classical CDs. His goal was to sell CDs at the same price as LPs, or roughly one-third of the price of CDs at the time. At first, he was acquiring digital recordings from a German company.  Then, Naxos began developing its catalog with young or unknown artists and orchestras. Heymann assumed the Naxos catalog would not cover more than fifty releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=birth |title=The Birth of Naxos |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking that the major labels would begin competing in the same sector, but given the success of the label, the company went on to become a full-fledged classical label covering a wide range of music. Over the years, Heymann led the label to not only record the standard classical repertoire, but also to focus on works that were not often recorded, or not at all. The company is "still filling gaps in the repertoire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-future-of-listening-will-be-an-all-you-eat-formula?page=0,1 |title=Naxos founder Klaus Heymann on what lies ahead for classical recordings - Page 2 |publisher=gramophone.co.uk |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann was one of the early proponents of digital music, and led Naxos to put its entire catalog on-line for streaming in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/klaus-heymann-the-last-record-man-standing/ |title=Klaus Heymann: The Last Record Man Standing |publisher=NewMusicBox |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; via hnh.com that became naxos.com. In 2002, he launched the Naxos Music Library, essentially used by educational institutions and libraries. In 2007, Heymann stated that "the label was positioned to survive and prosper without selling CDs,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsonline.com/executive_bio.aspx |title=Press Room |publisher=Classicsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055533/http://www.classicsonline.com/executive_bio.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "revenue from other sources is now big enough to let us not only survive but lead a healthy, profitable existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/interviews/1207hey/ |title=Klaus Heymann: A 20th-Anniversary Chat with the Founder of Naxos |publisher=Stereophile.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created distribution companies in most major music markets to distribute Naxos recordings, and the group of companies is now a major distributor of classical recordings and classical music DVDs around the world, including those of [[Warner Classics]] and [[Sony]].

Heymann claimed, in a 2007 interview with Stereophile Magazine, that he was only just making a "decent return" from the more than $80 million he invested in the company, "thanks to the advent of digital platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/content/klaus-heymann-20th-anniversary-chat-founder-naxos-page-2 |title=Klaus Heymann: A 20th-Anniversary Chat with the Founder of Naxos Page 2 |publisher=Stereophile.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the future of the classical music market as a mix of CDs, downloads and streaming: "Whether physical product will be a half of today or a third of today, nobody knows. There will also be downloads, and all kinds of subscription things. Our streaming classical-music library right now is by far the most successful in our field, and the most profitable for us and for the labels. But there may be others that mix paid and unpaid [streaming]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/news/klaus_heymann_of_naxos/ |title=Klaus Heymann of Naxos |publisher=Stereophile.com |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann's strategy is to be "the last man standing in terms of distributing classical music in physical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Midgette |first=Anne |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-classical-beat/2010/07/the_future_of_the_recording_in.html |title=The Classical Beat - The future of the recording industry: is there one? |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Heymann successfully sued music critic [[Norman Lebrecht]] for defamation, for a book entitled ''Maestros, Masterpieces and Madness: The Secret Life and Shameful Death of the Classical Record Industry'', published by Penguin, which led to the UK publisher pulping all copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/music-critics-book-is-pulped-as-penguin-loses-defamation-case-398144.html |title=Music critic's book is pulped as Penguin loses defamation case - Crime - UK |publisher=The Independent |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann is also the co-founder of Artaria Editions, a music-publishing house with a specialist interest in rare eighteenth-century repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artaria.com|title=Artaria Editions – High quality sheet music from the 18th century|website=Artaria Editions|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann lives in Hong Kong with his wife Takako Nishizaki and their son Henryk.

'''Károly Gundel''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈkaːroj ˈɡundɛl|lang|Hu-Károly_Gundel.ogg}}; 23 September 1883&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1956) was a Hungarian restaurateur, business magnate, philanthropist, writer of culinary works and the former owner of the [[Gundel Restaurant]].

==Family==
Károly Gundel was born on 23 September 1883 in Budapest, the son of Johann Gundel, a [[Bavarian people|Bavarian]]-born [[German people|German]] restaurateur who emigrated to [[Hungary]] in 1857. His mother was Anna Kommer. Of the 5 children of János Gundel it was Károly who inherited his father’s passion for the catering profession and his gastronomic genius. He married in 1907 with Margit Blasutigh. They had 13 children together.

His grandchildren were [[Zoltán Latinovits]], [[István Bujtor]] and [[Károly Frenreisz]].

==Life==
After the trade school, he learned the craft in famous restaurants in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[England]] and [[France]] from 1900. He was secretary in the [[Tatranská Lomnica|Tátralomnic]]'s hotel between 1906 and 1908. In 1908 he became the director. He bought the Wampetich restaurant in 1910. (Later it became the Gundel restaurant). From 1937 Károly Gundel managed the restaurant of the Hotel Gellért as well. Many well-known politicians, artists, and prime exponents of business life were regular guests in his restaurants. His cookbooks were the best and best-known books in Hungarian gastronomy. He wrote in foreign languages, gave cooking demonstrations and exhibitions, and popularized [[Hungarian cuisine]], boosting tourism. He was also one of the leaders of the Hungarian [[Hospitality|restaurateur]], hoteliers and industry. ''To host, to be a guest'', a book by Frigyes Karinthy (Budapest, 1933) was made with his advice.

==Gundel restaurant==
Károly Gundel's restaurant was the official restaurant of the Hungarian Pavilion in the New York World's Fair in 1939. '''The Gundel Restaurant is a bigger, better publicity from Budapest than a boatload of tourist brochures."'' (New York Times)
In 1949, the Gundel restaurant was nationalized. The Gundel Restaurant is today the most prestigious restaurant in Budapest.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Gundel Interior.jpg|thumb|right|Gundel Interior]]

One of Gundel's signature dishes is the Gundel [[palacsinta]], a crepe with a filling made from rum, raisin, walnuts, and lemon zest, served with a chocolate sauce. Gundel also claims to have created Palóc soup, a soup that aimed to be "like [[goulash]] . . . yet not goulash," according to the Gundel web site.

'''Lex Brown''' (born [[Maybole]], Ayrshire) is a Scottish businessman. A former [[Military awards and decorations of the United Kingdom|decorated]] [[RAF]] helicopter pilot,&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/the-first-time-he-saw-castle-tioram-he-almost-flew-a-helicopter-into-it-now-this-ex-raf-pilot-says-he-s-fighting-to-save-the-highland-landmark-so-who-is-lex-brown-and-why-is-there-such-hostility-to-his-pounds-4-5-million-plans-1.70728|title=The battle for Castle Tioram|last=Tierney|first=Michael|date=15 November 2004|work=The Herald|accessdate=27 June 2011|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came to public attention after buying [[Tioram Castle]], in [[Moidart]], for £300,000 in 1997.

There followed years of high-profile conflicts with [[Historic Scotland]], [[Highland Council]] and other interested parties,&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/12-years-and-a-few.5646132.jp|title=12 years and a few millions later, Lex Brown may soon be king of his castle|last=Ross|first=John|date=15 September 2009|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=27 June 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[public inquiry]] in 2002 and an appeal to the [[Scottish Government]] in 2006.

There have been a great number of '''anamorphic format trade names''', for reasons of prestige, technology, or vanity. The basic [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[anamorphic format]] originally popularized as [[CinemaScope]] has been known by a number of other monikers. In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re-branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a cliché throwback, and thus the generic name of ''anamorphic format'' has become predominant.

All of the following trade names refer to the modern [[SMPTE]]-standard anamorphic 35&amp;nbsp;mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time. Generically speaking, this means a 2× anamorphosis lens with 4-perf [[negative pulldown]] for both image origination and projection, and an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1 until 1970 (requiring special, narrow "negative assembly" [[film splice|splices]]) and 2.39:1 after 1970 (using conventional "negative assembly" splices). The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate "negative assembly", and also to better hide "negative assembly" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight "flash" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice. The term ''anamorphic'' should not be considered synonymous with [[widescreen]]; [[VistaVision]] was non-anamorphic, and at the time of shooting, so was [[Techniscope]]
.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">The '''National Association of British Manufacturers''' ('''NABM'''), formerly the '''National Union of Manufacturers''' ('''NUM'''), was an [[employers' association]] in the United Kingdom.

Founded in 1915 as the '''British Manufacturers' Association''' ('''BMA'''), it was renamed the National Union of Manufacturers in 1917 and the National Association of British Manufacturers in 1961. It was particularly strong among small and middle-sized firms. It merged with the [[Federation of British Industries]] and the [[British Employers' Confederation]] in 1965 to form the [[Confederation of British Industry]].

The '''National Federation of Independent Business''' ('''NFIB''') is the largest small business association in the U.S. It is headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with offices in [[Washington, D.C.]], and all 50 [[U.S. state|state]] capitals. NFIB is a non-profit that works to defend the right of small business owners to own and operate their businesses without undue government interference.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business&lt;/ref&gt; Its political action committee is called [[Save America's Free Enterprise]] Trust.

==History==
{{advert section|date=July 2017}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
NFIB was founded by C. Wilson Harder in 1943 and maintained its headquarters in [[San Mateo, California]], until 1992 when it was relocated to Nashville, TN. Harder began with a home office and sold the first memberships to his neighbors. His vision was to give small and independent business a voice in governmental decision-making through political advocacy. Since its early history, NFIB's political agenda has been determined through a one-vote balloting process of its membership.

Harder was succeeded in 1969 by his son John, who was replaced just six months later by Wilson S. Johnson. Under Johnson, member Action Councils were created, which still exist today, known as Leadership Councils. Through this time, NFIB also began to gain greater recognition in Washington, D.C., and in state capitals.

John Sloan became President of NFIB in 1983. He was the first chief executive to be brought in from outside the organization. Sloan installed a business structure with a sales manager, finance and administration directed by the CFO (both in San Mateo), and expanded the organization's presence with a public policy operation in Washington, DC.

In 1983, the organization established the NFIB Member Services Corporation. The Corporation is wholly owned by NFIB. Its purpose is to offer preferred-provider member benefit programs to assist members in reducing operating costs. Programs include worker's compensation insurance, commercial and personal health insurance, credit card processing, operational supplies, and discounts on commonly used business products and services.

In 1992, following the death of John Sloan, Jack Faris assumed the role of President and clearly defined NFIB's role in affecting public policy at the state and federal levels through [[politics|political]] and [[grassroots]] [[activism]], and lobbying with lawmakers in an integrated manner. In 1992, NFIB headquarters were officially relocated to Nashville, TN.

Jack Faris announced his retirement in early 2005. The board formed a search committee and selected Todd A. Stottlemyer as the fifth President of NFIB. Stottlemyer took the reins of NFIB on February 15, 2006, with a goal of improving NFIB's non-partisan reach and technology infrastructure.

In February 2009, Dan Danner became the sixth president of NFIB and served until February 2016. Under Danner's leadership, NFIB proved to be a driving force in opposing major governmental regulations; in 2012 it gained historical recognition as the only business association to challenge President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as a party to the Supreme Court case ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]''.

Following Danner's retirement, Juanita Duggan was named President and CEO in February 2016. Duggan has taken the lead in establishing NFIB as the source for definitive information on prospective Supreme Court Justices, with regard to their stance on business issues. Recognizing the enduring impact judges can have on the business environment for independent business.

NFIB has grown from Harder's for-profit [[entrepreneur]]ial vision in 1943 to the non-profit national association of more than 325,000 members it is today.

==Politics==
On its website, the National Federation of Independent Business states that it is a "nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 1943" and "represents the consensus views of its members in Washington and all 50 state capitals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfib.com/about-nfib|title=About NFIB|publisher=www.NFIB.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Political action committee|PAC]] is called Save America's Free Enterprise Trust (SAFE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fec-political-committees.findthedata.org/l/14397/National-Federation-of-Independent-Business-Save-Americas-Free-Enterprise-Trust |title=National Federation of Independent Business/ Save Americas Free Enterprise Trust - 2012 FEC PAC - Qualified Committee |publisher=www.findthedata.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710193237/http://fec-political-committees.findthedata.org/l/14397/National-Federation-of-Independent-Business-Save-Americas-Free-Enterprise-Trust |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000160|title=National Fedn of Independent Business|publisher=www.opensecrets.org|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 25 of its members, all Republican, were elected to the 112th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfib.com/issues-elections/issues-elections-item?cmsid=55637|title=25 NFIB Members Join the 112th Congress|publisher=www.NFIB.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of them, such as [[Rand Paul]], [[Jeff Duncan (politician)|Jeff Duncan]], [[Paul Gosar]] and [[Kristi Noem]], are affiliated with or endorsed by the [[Tea Party movement]].

Also in 2010, the NFIB became the lead plaintiff opposing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] health care reform legislation. The organization joined 26 states in the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the act. The case was picked up by the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' on June 28, 2012, upholding most provisions of the act. [[Karl Rove|Karl Rove's]] conservative [[Crossroads GPS]] PAC gave NFIB $3.7 million to help fund the court fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slack|first=Donovan|title=Crossroads GPS gave $3.7 million to plaintiff in health care suit|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/04/crossroads-gps-gave-million-to-plaintiff-in-health-120501.html|accessdate=2013-10-11|newspaper=Politico.com|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, many other small business advocates supported PPACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pinckney| first =Barbara|url=http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/03/22/daily2.html| title =Business groups split on health care bill| work=The Business Review| date= 2010-03-22| accessdate = 2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFIB supported the [[America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend section 179 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased limitations on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from [[taxable income]].&lt;ref name=cbo4457&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4457|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45326|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.&lt;ref name=PomerleauTaxFound&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Kyle|title=Tiberi Bill on permanent Extension of Small Business Expensing|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/tiberi-bill-permanent-extension-small-business-expensing|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=12 June 2014|date=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Danner, the president and CEO at that time, argued that Congress could help small business by passing the bill as it would enable small businesses to "plan for the future, invest in the economy and hire new workers."&lt;ref name=CNBC5ways&gt;{{cite news|last1=Danner|first1=Dan|title=5 ways Washington can help small business|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101650387|accessdate=12 June 2014|publisher=CNBC|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IN 2017, NFIB endorsed confirmation of SCOTUS nominee [[Neil Gorsuch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfib.com/assets/NFIB-Key-Vote-Support-of-U.S.-Supreme-Court-Nomination-Judge-Gorsuch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational [[database]] management systems (also referred to as [[OLTP]] On Line Transaction Processing databases), are used to update data in real-time. These types of databases allow users to do more than simply view archived data. Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].&lt;ref name="Techopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5711/operational-database-odb |title=Operational Database (ODB)|publisher=Techopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLTP databases provide [[Database transaction|transactions]] as main abstraction to guarantee data consistency that guarantee the so-called [[ACID properties]]. Basically, the consistency of the data is guaranteed in the case of failures and/or concurrent access to the data.

Since the early 90's, the operational database software market has been largely taken over by [[SQL]] engines. Today, the operational [[DBMS]] market (formerly [[OLTP]]) is evolving dramatically, with new, innovative entrants and incumbents supporting the growing use of unstructured data and [[NoSQL]] DBMS engines, as well as [[XML database]]s and [[NewSQL|NewSQL databases]]. NoSQL databases typically have focused on scalability and have renounced to data consistency by not providing transactions as OLTP system do. Operational databases are increasingly supporting [[distributed database]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Distributed Databases|last=Ozsu|first=M. Tamer|last2=Valduriez|first2=Patrick|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-8833-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture that can leverage distribution to provide [[high availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] through [[replication (computing)|replication]] and [[scale out]] ability.

The growing role of operational databases in the [[information technology|IT]] industry is moving fast from legacy databases to real-time operational databases capable to handle distributed web and mobile demand and to address [[Big data]] challenges. Recognizing this, [[Gartner]] started to publish the [[Magic Quadrant]] for Operational Database Management Systems in October 2013.&lt;ref name="Gartner Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2610218/magic-quadrant-operational-database-management |title=Gartner Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems|publisher=Gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in business ==

Operational databases are used to store, manage and track real-time business information. For example, a company might have an operational database used to track warehouse/stock quantities. As customers order products from an online web store, an operational database can be used to keep track of how many items have been sold and when the company will need to reorder stock.  An '''operational database''' stores information about the activities of an [[organization]], for example [[customer relationship management]] transactions or financial operations, in a computer [[database]].

Operational databases allow a business to enter, gather, and retrieve large quantities of specific information, such as company legal data, financial data, call data records, personal employee information, sales data, customer data, data on assets and many other information.  An important feature of storing information in an operational database is the ability to share information across the company and over the Internet.  Operational databases can be used to manage mission-critical business data, to monitor activities, to audit suspicious transactions, or to review the history of dealings with a particular customer.  They can also be part of the actual process of making and fulfilling a purchase, for example in [[e-commerce]].

==Data warehouse terminology==

In [[Data warehouse|data warehousing]], the term is even more specific: the operational database is the one which is accessed by an [[operational system]] (for example a customer-facing website or the application used by the customer service department) to carry out regular operations of an organization. Operational databases usually use an [[online transaction processing]] database which is optimized for faster transaction processing ([[create, read, update and delete]] operations). An operational database is the source for a data warehouse.&lt;ref name="Techopedia" /&gt;

'''Pedro Noel''' is a Brazilian journalist and graduated philosopher. According to Romanian media, he is also an Internet media activist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matzal|first=Andra|title=Guverne" de cartier și colonii ecologice.

== Whistleblowing and investigative journalism ==

In December 2010, under the handle of 'FuturePress', Noel and Carrion started to write to the news portal WLCentral.org [http://wlcentral.org] where they exposed in different languages and using different approaches for more than one year analysis on whistleblowing material, articles and reports on human-rights violations, civic-movements and net-neutrality.

In the late 2011, Pedro Noel along with other journalists started the [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Anna|title=Shine a light|url=http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Shine-A-Light|publisher=Reykavik Grapevine|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media agency focused on the defense of human rights by promoting transparency, freedom of information and speech, whistleblowing and investigative journalism, conceived as a global network made up of cooperative local platforms and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veal|first=Lowana|title=Alternative to Wikileaks Arises in Iceland|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/alternative-to-wikileaks-arises-in-iceland/|publisher=IPS International Press News|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the editor of AWP, Pedro Noel took part in more than 50 revelations of wrongdoing, corruption and abuse in [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Iceland]], since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=AWP - Publications |url=https://data.awp.is|publisher=AWP|accessdate=1 Jan 2016|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denouncing freedom of expression violations in Ecuador and Latin America ==

In a controversial session at 32nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Hamburg in 2015, Noel held a talk with Canadian journalist [[Bethany Horne]] denouncing violations of free speech standards by the Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Ecuador: how an authoritarian government is fooling the entire world |url=https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7134-ecuador_how_an_authoritarian_government_is_fooling_the_entire_world|publisher=CCC|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the talk, Pedro Noel released documents providing evidence that press and media coverage of critical issues were considered by Ecuadorian government as risk factors for democratic stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Reporte de la Inteligencia Ecuatoriana (SENAIN) sobre factores de riesgo y amenazas a la estabilidad democrática |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/amenazas/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the local platform [[Ecuador Transparente]], operated by [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]]. The publication followed previous denounces, also performed by [[Ecuador Transparente]], of physical and on-line surveillance and spying against activists, journalists and politicians in Ecuador, performed by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=SENAIN llevó a cabo espionaje sistemático a políticos y activistas |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/vigilancia/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=5 Aug 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Noel also took part in the publication of alleged proofs of illegal Internet censorship performed by Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=El gobierno ecuatoriano y la Asociación de Proveedores de Internet trabajan juntos para bloquear el acceso a páginas web |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/censura-movistar/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Katitza|title=Leaked Documents Confirm Ecuador’s Internet Censorship Machine |url=https://www.eff.org/nl/node/91232|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Pedro Noel also participated in the release of the [[Godwin Papers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Los papeles de Godwin |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/papeles-godwin/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed on-line harassment and discredit campaigns managed by the Ecuadorian government against local journalists, media outlets and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Filtración revela que gobierno ecuatoriano pagó campaña contra la CIDH y Fundamedios|url=http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/filtracion-revela-que-gobierno-ecuatoriano-pago-campana-contra-la-cidh-y-fundamedios/|publisher=Fundamedios|accessdate=16 Nov 2016|location=Ecuador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social networks ==

In 2011, along with other Internet activists and researchers, Pedro Noel started&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roos|first=Jerome|title=Virality: international media coverage of The Global Square|url=http://roarmag.org/2012/02/global-square-wikileaks-media-social-network/|publisher=RoarMag.org|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Online magazine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Redes sociais sem censura e com privacidade|url=http://www.fne.org.br/fne/index.php/fne/jornal/edicao_121_junho_2012/redes_sociais_sem_censura_e_com_privacidade|publisher=Jornal do Engenheiro|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=Brasilia, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project TheGlobalSquare in partnership with [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft]] and its project [[Tribler]]. The social network is focused on attack and censorship resilient P2P information broadcasting and social systems.

== Spanish Indignados ==

Along with Santiago Carrion, Noel founded the news portal EuropeanRevolution.net [http://europeanrevolution.net], a portal conceived as an informative platform for activists, having as  first goal to translate into English what was happening with the 15 May movement and in the squares occupations around Europe in order to expand its impact worldwide.

This led Noel to collaborate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hérard|first=Pascal|title=Les indignés européens marchent sur Paris|url=http://www.tv5.org/cms/chaine-francophone/info/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Mouvement-des-indignes-2011/p-17709-Les-indignes-europeens-marchent-sur-Paris.htm|publisher=TV5 Monde|accessdate=15 September 2011|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; with TakeTheSquare.net [http://TakeTheSquare.net]

The project was aimed to create a task-force seeking structured change of the worldwide political reality- designed to bring the May 15th ideals to a global context.

Noel and other were the responsible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoltan|first=Petru|title=Omul care a scos 700.000 de spanioli în stradă: &lt;&lt;În statul român, represiunile şi supravegherea sunt mai puternice&gt;&gt;|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/proteste-spania-romania-607400.htm|publisher=Jornalul|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the worldwide online campaign which culminated in the global day of action on [[15 October 2011 global protests|October 15th 2011]] in more than 950 cities in 82 countries and its main website 15October.net [https://web.archive.org/web/20110923151059/http://15october.net/].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2692">'''Phrase completion scales''' are a type of [[psychometrics|psychometric]] scale used in [[questionnaire]]s. Developed in response to the problems associated with '''[[Likert scale]]s,''' Phrase completions are concise, unidimensional measures that tap ordinal level data in a manner that approximates interval level data. 
 
== Overview of the phrase completion method ==

Phrase completions consist of a phrase followed by an 11-point response key. The phrase introduces part of the concept. Marking a reply on the response key completes the concept. The response key represents the underlying theoretical continuum. Zero(0)indicates the absence of the construct. Ten(10)indicates the theorized maximum amount of the construct. Response keys are reversed on alternate items to mitigate response set bias.

== Sample question using the phrase completion method ==
 
'''I am aware of the presence of God or the Divine'''
   '''Never'''                                                                       '''Continually'''                                                                            
    0	    1	    2	    3	    4	    5	    6	    7	    8	    9	    10

== Scoring and analysis ==

After the questionnaire is completed the score on each item is summed together, to create a test score for the respondent. Hence, Phrase Completions, like Likert scales, are often considered to be summative scales.

== Level of measurement ==

The response categories represent an ordinal [[level of measurement]]. Ordinal level data, however, varies in terms of how closely it approximates interval level data. By using a numerical continuum as the response key instead of sentiments that reflect intensity of agreement, respondents may be able to quantify their responses in more equal units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6492">A '''prison consultant''' provides newly convicted criminals with advice on how to cope and survive in the unfamiliar surroundings of prison.  Prison consultants may also provide a client's attorney with advice on how to lobby the sentencing judge for a shorter sentence, and how to get a client sentenced to a lower security level prison (the higher a prison's security level, the more violent and dangerous).  They may advise [[White-collar crime|white-collar]] and celebrity criminals, high-level drug dealers and disgraced politicians to help them navigate the society of prison and make the most of their stay. &lt;ref&gt;http://rdapdan.com/services/qualify-for-rdap-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultants charge anywhere from several hundred to many thousands of dollars, with no promises made. Among their past clients have been [[Bernard Madoff]], [[Michael Milken]], [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Michael Vick]], [[Plaxico Burress]], [[Martha Stewart]], and [[Leona Helmsley]].&lt;ref name= "NYT_2009-10-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "CTRIB_2011-02-24"&gt;{{ cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-24/news/ct-met-federal-prison-consulting-20110224_1_prison-consultants-prison-yard-sentencing-consultants|title=Ex-cons offer prison primers for soon-to-be incarcerated execs|publisher= ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioners==
Becoming a prison consultant requires no formal training or certification, and no agency tracks those in the business. Certifications for prison consultants exist, but none are issued by an accredited entity.  Most people who hold themselves out as prison consultants are ex-convicts who, by the nature of their background, are considered to be disreputable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.wbhm.org/feature/2014/life-after-prison-ex-felons-often-struggle-to-find-a-job/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most prison consultants are sole-practitioners, giving cause for further skepticism.  The [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] takes no position on consulting.&lt;ref name= "NYT_2009-10-10"&gt;{{ cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/sports/11consultants.html|title=Consultants Are Providing High-Profile Inmates a Game Plan for Coping|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=October 10, 2009| first=Jonathan| last=Abrams| accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional advice==
In general, consultants will advise prison-bound clients to keep a low profile and avoid offending other inmates.  Offenses can include joining a conversation without an invitation, asking personal questions without a proper cue, and taking liberties with the television (most fights take place in the TV room).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/07/28/us/AP-US-Prison-Brokers.html Prison Consultants Help Inmates Get Good Digs], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultants can help navigate early-release programs and will recommend entry into a drug or alcohol rehab program. Federal prison consultants often educate clients regarding the [[Residential Drug Abuse Program]], a 500 hour program which can reduce a federal sentence up to 12 months.&lt;ref name="SPK"&gt;[http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/mar/28/spokane-valley-man-uses-experience-to-coach-incomi], ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', March 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultants may advise about Federal Bureau of Prisons employee personality types; how to defend one's self in a prison fight; and how best to avoid being raped, stabbed or beaten.

Clients are warned to expect [[strip search]]es and to accept a complete loss of personal control to the guards.

==Commentary on infamous inmates==
Much news and discussion of prison consultants has centered on Bernard Madoff. Herbert Hoelter, who advised Madoff, says that Madoff's sentencing to the medium-security [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Federal Correctional Complex]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]] is appropriate because the facility is next door to a medical center, and if Madoff becomes eligible for transfer to a low-security prison, there is one within the same complex. Hoelter expects that a number of his other clients in Butner will take Madoff under their wing, saying "It's like a buddy system." He thinks Madoff's lengthy term "will give him credibility with other inmates."  His advice to Madoff was "It’s a matter of keeping your space and having respect for other people".&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

However, Steven Oberfest of The Prison Coach says Madoff enters prison at a disadvantage because the other prisoners know everything about him from the media, but he knows nothing about them.  Oberfest calls Butner "a general, nasty, medium-security-type prison" and says Madoff needs to be careful of other inmates who might be paid by those he defrauded to intimidate or harm him.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/07/15/madoffs-prison-consultant-weighs-on-inmate-no-61727-054/ Madoff’s Prison Consultant Weighs In On Inmate No. 61727-054], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Larry Levine expects that someone will make a payment to another inmate's family, a dining-hall distraction will be created, and Madoff will be stabbed.&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-biz-tells-us-how-bernie-madoff-will-be-killed-in-jail-clip-2009-7 Fox Biz: How Madoff Will Be Killed In Jail], ''[[Fox Business]]'', July 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoelter says convicted child molester [[Jerry Sandusky]] "is in for a tough, tough ride". Unlike Madoff, who lives among his fellow prisoners, Sandusky will likely have to spend the rest of his life in [[solitary confinement]] for his own safety. A similar high-profile child sex offender, [[John Geoghan]], was targeted and murdered by a fellow inmate in 2003. Levine noted the significant dangers in prison for sex offenders.&lt;ref name="DFP"&gt;[http://www.freep.com/usatoday/article/1618657&amp;usatref=sportsmod?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Sports|p Sandusky begins grim transition to prison], ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', October 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8597">'''Pyrosequencing''' is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] (determining the order of [[nucleotides]] in DNA) based on the "sequencing by synthesis" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a [[DNA polymerase]]. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when [[pyrophosphate]] is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.

The principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Nyren, Petersson and Uhlen (1993) “Solid Phase DNA Minisequencing by an Enzymatic Luminometric Inorganic Pyrophosphate Detection Assay” Analytical Biochemistry 208 (1), 171-175, https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1993.1024&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A8081&amp;dswid=3295#sthash.08HyBugr.dpbs Bertil Pettersson], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]] by combining the [[solid phase sequencing]] method&lt;ref&gt;Uhlen (1989) ”Magnetic separation of DNA”  Nature 340: 733-4, https://doi.org/10.1038/340733a0&lt;/ref&gt; using [[streptavidin]] coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the [[Luciferase|firefly luciferase]] enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;Nyren and Lundin (1985) “Enzymatic method for continuous monitoring of inorganic pyrophosphate synthesis” Analytiocal Biochemistry 151 (2): 504-509.  https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(85)90211-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A mixture of three [[enzyme]]s ([[DNA polymerase]], [[Sulfate adenylyltransferase|ATP sulfurylase]] and firefly [[luciferase]]) and a nucleotide ([[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTP]]) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.

A second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Ronaghi, Uhlén and Nyrén (1998) ”A sequenbcing method based on real-time pyrophosphate” Science. 281 (5375): 363. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.363  .&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Mostafa Ronaghi]], [https://www.kth.se/en/bio/research/proteomics/proteomics-researchers/mathias-uhlen-1.67763 Mathias Uhlen] and [[Pål Nyrén|Pål Nyren]]. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme [[apyrase]] is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the [[DNA polymerase]], the [[luciferase]] and the [[apyrase]] to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.

A third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Marguiles et al (2005) “Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors” Nature 437, 376-380.  https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature03959;&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] and co-workers at the company [[454 Life Sciences]]. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[microarray]]. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in [[genomics]] research, with rapidly falling prices for [[DNA sequencing]] allowing [[whole genome sequencing]] at affordable prices.

==Procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QIAGEN|title=Pyrosequencing Technology and Platform Overview|url=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/technologies/pyrosequencing-resource-center/technology-overview/|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[File:How Pyrosequencing Works.svg|alt=How Pyrosequencing Works|thumb|679x679px|The chart shows how pyrosequencing works.]]
"Sequencing by synthesis" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of [[DNA polymerase]] (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another [[chemiluminescence|chemoluminescent]] [[enzyme]].  Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of [[DNA]] by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step.  The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T [[nucleotides]] are sequentially added and removed from the reaction.  Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template.  The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.

For the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA ([[ssDNA#ssDNA|ssDNA]]) template is hybridized to a sequencing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] and incubated with the enzymes [[DNA polymerase]], [[ATP sulfurylase]], [[luciferase]] and [[apyrase]], and with the substrates [[adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate]] (APS) and [[luciferin]].
# The addition of one of the four [[deoxynucleotide triphosphate]]s ([[dNTP]]s) (dATPαS, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi).
# ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program.
# Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the [[apyrase]], and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.

==Limitations==

Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|chain termination]] methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing).  This can make the process of [[genome assembly]] more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of [[repetitive DNA]]. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.

==Commercialization==

The company '''Pyrosequencing AB''' in [[Uppsala, Sweden]] was founded with [[venture capital]] provided by [[HealthCap]] in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] in 1999. It was renamed to [http://www.biotage.com Biotage] in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by [[Qiagen]] in 2008.  Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to [[454 Life Sciences]]. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|large-scale DNA sequencing]], including [[genome project|genome sequencing]] and [[metagenomics]].

[[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollmer|first1=Mark|title=Roche to close 454 Life Sciences as it reduces gene sequencing focus |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/roche-to-close-454-life-sciences-as-it-reduces-gene-sequencing-focus|work=Fierce Biotech|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Root cause analysis''' ('''RCA''') is a method of [[problem solving]] used for identifying the [[root cause]]s of faults or problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Paul F.|last2=Dell|first2=Larry D.|last3=Anderson|first3=Gaylord F.|title=Root Cause Analysis: A Tool for Total Quality Management|date=1993|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87389-163-5|pages=8–17|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A factor is considered a root cause if removal thereof from the problem-fault-sequence prevents the final undesirable outcome from recurring; whereas a causal factor is one that affects an event's outcome, but is not a root cause.  Though removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence with certainty.

Essentially it is based on four general principles,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended throughout this article:

* Define and describe properly the event or problem ([[5 Whys|'five whys' technique]]).
* Establish a timeline from normal situation until the final crisis or failure.
* Distinguish between root causes and causal factor.
* Once implemented (and with constant execution), RCA is transformed into a method of problem prediction.

== Uses ==
RCA is applied to methodically identify and correct the root causes of events, rather than to simply address the symptomatic result.  Focusing correction on root causes has the goal of entirely preventing problem recurrence.  Conversely, RCFA (Root Cause Failure Analysis) recognizes that complete prevention of recurrence by one corrective action is not always possible.

RCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. Analysis is done ''after'' an event has occurred. Insights in RCA make it potentially useful as a preemptive method. In that event, RCA can be used to ''forecast'' or predict probable events even ''before'' they occur. While one follows the other, RCA is a completely separate process to [[incident management]].

== Examples ==
For example, imagine a fictional segment of students who received poor testing scores. After initial investigation, it was verified that students taking tests in the final period of the school day got lower scores. Further investigation revealed that late in the day, the students lacked ability to focus. Even further investigation revealed that the reason for the lack of focus was hunger. So, the root cause of the poor testing scores was hunger, remedied by moving the testing time to soon after lunch.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

As another example, imagine an investigation into a machine that stopped because it overloaded and the fuse blew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taiichi Ohno|title=Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production|page=17|year=1988|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Productivity Press|ISBN=0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation shows that the machine overloaded because it had a bearing that wasn't being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the  automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump which was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows that it has a worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there isn't an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump, and damage it. The root cause of the problem is therefore that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events recurring. Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the lubrication pump will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. But there is a risk that the problem will simply recur, until the root cause is dealt with.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Note that "root causes" are likely to have many levels, and the analysis terminates at a level that is "root" only to the eyes of the current investigator.  Looking at the second example, a deeper level root cause is that the maintenance procedures at the plant included periodic inspection of the lubrication subsystem every two years, while the current lubrication subsystem vendor's product specified a 6-month period.  Switching vendors may have been due to management's desire to save money, and a failure to consult with cognizant engineering staff on the implication of the change, and so on.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Thus, while the "root cause" shown above may have prevented the quoted recurrence, it would not have prevented other{{snd}} perhaps more severe{{snd}} future failures.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Quite often, "engineering-type" root cause analysis stops at the engineering level, and fails to go down to deeper, organizational roots.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Root cause analysis is used in [[ITIL]], a set of detailed practices for [[IT service management]], where the analysis is performed to resolve a recurring incident by the problem manager. Within [[computer security incident management]], root cause analysis may be called security investigation and analysis.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Classification ==
Rather than one sharply defined methodology, RCA comprises many different tools, processes, and philosophies. However, several very-broadly defined approaches or "schools" can be identified by their basic approach or field of origin: safety-based, production-based, assembly-based, process-based, failure-based, and systems-based.

* Safety-based RCA arose from the fields of [[Accident Analysis|accident analysis]] and [[occupational safety and health]].
* Production-based RCA has roots in the field of [[quality control]] for industrial [[manufacturing]].
* Process-based RCA, a follow-on to production-based RCA, broadens the scope of RCA to include [[business process]]es.
* Failure-based RCA originates in the practice of [[failure analysis]] as employed in [[engineering]] and [[Maintenance, Repair and Operations|maintenance]].
* Systems-based RCA has emerged as an amalgam of the preceding schools, incorporating elements from other fields such as [[change management]], [[risk management]] and [[systems analysis]].

Despite the different approaches among the various schools of root cause analysis, all share some common principles. Several general processes for performing RCA can also be defined.

==General principles==
# The primary aim of root cause analysis is: to identify the factors that resulted in the nature, the magnitude, the location, and the timing of the harmful outcomes (consequences) of one or more past events; to determine what behaviors, actions, inactions, or conditions need to be changed; to prevent recurrence of similar harmful outcomes; and to identify lessons that may promote the achievement of better consequences. ("Success" is defined as the near-certain prevention of recurrence).
# To be effective, root cause analysis must be performed systematically, usually as part of an investigation, with conclusions and root causes that are identified backed up by documented evidence. A team effort is typically required.
# There may be more than one root cause for an event or a problem, therefore the difficult part is demonstrating the persistence and sustaining the effort required to determine them.
# The purpose of identifying all solutions to a problem is to prevent recurrence at lowest cost in the simplest way. If there are alternatives that are equally effective, then the simplest or lowest cost approach is preferred.
# The root causes identified will depend on the way in which the problem or event is defined. Effective problem statements and event descriptions (as failures, for example) are helpful and usually required to ensure the execution of appropriate analyses.
# One logical way to trace down root causes is by utilizing [[hierarchical clustering]] [[data mining|data-mining]] solutions (such as [[graph theory|graph-theory-based]] data mining). A root cause is defined in that context as "the conditions that enable one or more causes". Root causes can be deductively sorted out from upper groups of which the groups include a specific cause.
# To be effective, the analysis should establish a [[sequence of events]] or [[timeline]] for understanding the relationships between contributory (causal) factors, root cause(s) and the defined problem or event to be prevented.
# Root cause analysis can help transform a reactive culture (one that reacts to problems) into a forward-looking culture (one that solves problems before they occur or escalate). More importantly, RCA reduces the frequency of problems occurring over time within the environment where the process is used.
# Root cause analysis as a force for change is a threat to many cultures and environments. Threats to cultures are often met with resistance. Other forms of management support may be required to achieve effectiveness and success with root cause analysis. For example, a "non-punitive" policy toward problem identifiers may be required.

==General process for performing and documenting an RCA-based corrective action==
RCA (in steps 3, 4 and 5) forms the most critical part of successful corrective action, directing the corrective action at the true root cause of the problem. Knowing the root cause is secondary to the goal of prevention, as it is not possible to determine an absolutely effective corrective action for the defined problem without knowing the root cause.

# Define the problem or describe the event to prevent in the future. Include the qualitative and quantitative attributes (properties) of the undesirable outcomes. Usually this includes specifying the natures, the magnitudes, the locations, and the timing of events. In some cases, "lowering the risks of reoccurrences" may be a reasonable target. For example, "lowering the risks" of future automobile accidents is certainly a more economically attainable goal than "preventing all" future automobile accidents.
# Gather data and evidence, classifying it along a timeline of events to the final failure or crisis. For every behavior, condition, action and inaction, specify in the "timeline" what should have been done when it differs from what was done.
# In data mining Hierarchical Clustering models, use the clustering groups instead of classifying: (a) peak the groups that exhibit the specific cause; (b) find their upper-groups; (c) find group characteristics that are consistent; (d) check with experts and validate.
# Ask "why" and identify the causes associated with each sequential step towards the defined problem or event. "Why" is taken to mean "What were the factors that directly resulted in the effect?"
# Classify causes into two categories: causal factors that relate to an event in the sequence; and root causes that interrupted that step of the sequence chain when eliminated.
# Identify all other harmful factors that have equal or better claim to be called "root causes". If there are multiple root causes, which is often the case, reveal those clearly for later optimum selection.
# Identify corrective action(s) that will, with certainty, prevent recurrence of each harmful effect and related outcomes or factors. Check that each corrective action would, if pre-implemented before the event, have reduced or prevented specific harmful effects.
# Identify solutions that, when effective and with consensus agreement of the group: prevent recurrence with reasonable certainty; are within the institution's control; meet its goals and objectives; and do not cause or introduce other new, unforeseen problems.
# Implement the recommended root cause correction(s).
# Ensure effectiveness by observing the implemented solutions in operation.
# Identify other possibly useful methodologies for problem solving and problem avoidance.
# Identify and address the other instances of each harmful outcome and harmful factor.

'''Said Tawfiq Khoury''' ({{lang-ar|سعيد الخوري}}&amp;lrm;) (June 6, 1923 - October 15, 2014) was a prominent [[Palestinian Christian]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]]. He was one of the three founders of [[Consolidated Contractors Company]], currently based in [[Athens]].  Khoury set up the business with his cousin Hasib Sabbagh in [[Beirut]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/construction-billionaire-said-khoury-dies-aged-91-568256.html|title=Construction billionaire Said Khoury dies, aged 91|last=|first=|date=17 October 2014|website=|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCC is the largest construction company in the [[Middle East]] and ranks among the [[Engineering News-Record#ENR rankings|top 25 international contractors]] with a revenue of 5.3 billion USD in 2013.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Engineering News Record|first=(ENR)|title=The 2011 Top 225 International Contractors|url=http://enr.construction.com/toplists/InternationalContractors/001-100.asp|work=ENR Top Lists|publisher=McGrawHill Construction}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCC has offices and projects in over 40 countries, and a workforce of more than 130,000 employees.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;http://www.ccc.me/revenue.php&lt;/ref&gt; Khoury who is listed as a billionaire by [[Forbes]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Said-Khoury_LCDK.html&lt;/ref&gt; is ranked 10th on the [[Arabian Business]] world's richest Arabs in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-world-s-richest-arabs-530591.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past few years, Khoury dedicated most of his time to the organisation he founded, '''The Bethlehem Development Foundation'''  that aims to rejuvenate the birthplace of [[Jesus Christ]] [[Bethlehem]] in Palestine, a holy city for [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethlehemdevelopment.org/about-us26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Khoury was born in [[Safed]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1923. He was nourished in an atmosphere of strong family ties, pervasive moral influence, and a deep sense of ethnic and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"&gt;http://www.aub.edu.lb/doctorates/recipients/2006/Pages/khoury-profile.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; After attending St. Luke's School in [[Haifa]], he followed his cousin Hasib Sabbagh to [[Lebanon]] in order to study in the [[American University of Beirut]], where both of them graduated from the faculty of engineering. Upon returning home, each of them founded a small construction company in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb" /&gt;

After the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] in 1948, both men fled back again, this time with their families, to the capital of [[Lebanon]], [[Beirut]], where they began working on construction projects. Said and Sabbagh's first task was in the Tripoli airport.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"/&gt; Khoury said they were motivated by the catastrophic expulsion from their homeland.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"/&gt;

In the early 1950s a contract to construct a storage yard for oil pipes in [[Homs]] for the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] introduced the young engineers to the world's largest construction company of that time, the [[Bechtel Group]]. The connection remained solid for many years, spearheading the [[Consolidated Contractors Company|CCC]]'s extraordinary transformation from a small subcontracting construction company into the international giant it is today

Said has three sons and two daughters, from which he has fourteen grandchildren. While Said remains as the president of the [[Consolidated Contractors Company|CCC]], his sons alongside the sons on Sabbagh are also at the helm of company.

He was a significant supporter of philanthropic activities in Palestine.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/2013-construction-week-power-100-507098.html?view=profile&amp;itemid=506945#.Uz1RG1eehFs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

Said Khoury held a Legion of Merit from the [[President of Lebanon|President of Lebanese Republic]] and a Legion of Unity from the President of the Republic of Yemen. He held as well as many other Medals of Merit and Honour from different parts of the World.&lt;ref name="usmep.us"&gt;http://www.usmep.us/usmep/international-board/said-t-khoury/&lt;/ref&gt;

Said has sponsored the establishment of the Said Khoury Information Technology Center of Excellence (SKITCE) at [[Al-Quds University]] in [[Abu Dis]].
Khoury received the HCEF Palestinian Diaspora Award given to individuals who have sustained commitment to revitalize Palestinian culture.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt;

'''''The Wall Street Journal Europe''''' is a daily English-language newspaper that covers global and regional business news for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).  Published by [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] (a [[News Corp]] company), it forms part of the business publication franchise which includes ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', and The Wall Street Journal Online (WSJ.com).  Together, these publications have a total circulation of 3.8 million.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Founded in 1983, ''The Wall Street Journal Europe'' is printed in nine locations throughout the region – Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K. and Israel.  The paper is distributed in more than 60 countries with almost 80% of its subscribers European citizens.

''The Wall Street Journal Europe'' draws on the Dow Jones network of more than 1,900 editors and reporters worldwide, including more than 400 in Europe alone, operating from 30 news bureaus across the EMEA region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europe.wsj.com |title=Europe.wsj.com |publisher=Europe.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers news and analysis, opinion, market data and multimedia features tailored for a European audience by a London-based editorial team.

Growth figures for circulation of ''The Wall Street Journal Europe'' may not be directly comparable to that of other newspapers beginning January 2008 due to the Journal's contract with Executive Learning Partnership (ELP) of the Netherlands.  This agreement involved ELP's purchasing copies of the newspaper at between 1¢ and 5¢ cents a copy, well below normal market price.  These copies, given at no cost to students, represented 41% of ''The Wall Street Journal Europe'' circulation by 2010.  Since ELP received payments from the Journal through intermediary companies, some journalists and a whistleblower then employed by the Journal alleged that the newspaper was secretly boosting circulation figures by buying its own papers.  This could have a positive impact on the newspaper's advertising revenues.  The contract also committed the Journal to publishing articles that reportedly promoted ELP's activities.  While maintaining that the arrangement was legitimate and appropriate, the European managing director of the Journal's parent [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], Andrew Langhoff, resigned in October 2011.  [[Les Hinton]], who was chief executive officer of Dow Jones &amp; Company  and who was reportedly advised of the arrangement with ELP, resigned July 2011 in conjunction with the unrelated [[News International phone hacking scandal]].&lt;ref name=GuardianLanghoff20111012&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Nick|title=Wall Street Journal circulation scam claims senior Murdoch executive|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/12/wall-street-journal-andrew-langhoff|accessdate=13 October 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHinton20110715&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|title=Les Hinton resigns from News Corp|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/15/les-hinton-rupert-murdoch|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final print edition of the newspaper was published on 29 September 2017.

[[File:Tiit Vähi teisel Arvamusfestivalil Narvas.jpg|thumb|Tiit Vähi (2016)]]
'''Tiit Vähi''' (born 10 January 1947) is an [[Estonia]]n politician who was [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] from 1995 to 1997. He was also [[acting Prime Minister]] for several months during 1992 under the [[transitional government]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kaagjärve vald|Kaagjärve parish]],&lt;ref&gt;http://valgamaalane.postimees.ee/3995043/intervjuu-tiit-vaehi-voib-toeoejuttu-ajada-ka-kell-kaks-oeoesel&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia, Vähi graduated from the [[Tallinn Technical University]] with a degree in Engineering. From the time of his graduation until 1992, he served in several top managerial post with the [[Valga Trucking Company]].

During the Estonian national independence movement, Vähi was among the organisers of the [[Estonian Popular Front]], and led its regional committee in [[Valga County]]. In 1989, he was appointed [[Estonian Minister for Transport and Communications|Minister for Transport and Communications]], a post that he held until January 1992. During his tenure as Transport Minister, he forged close ties with the transport ministries of the [[Nordic countries]] and improved relations with the other two [[Baltic States]] on transport related issues. He transferred control of Estonia's airports, railways and sea ports, under the control Moscow, to the Estonian authorities.

Shortly after Estonia's return to independence in 1991, Vähi was appointed as the Government's special representative to north-eastern Estonia, a region inhabited by a majority of ethnic [[Russians]].

On 30 January 1992, Vähi became the second post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Prime Minister of Estonia, succeeding [[Edgar Savisaar]]. During this first stint as Prime Minister, he embarked upon a vast programme to transform the country's economy from its being [[centrally planned economy|centrally controlled]] into a more [[free market economy]]. His government also introduced the Estonian currency, the [[Estonian kroon|Kroon]], in June 1992. He also founded the [[Estonian Privatisation Agency]], which embarked on the privatisation of government-owned assets to the private sector. 
 
As agreed when he assumed the post Prime Minister in the transition government, Vähi did not participate in the parliamentary elections on 20 September 1992.

In 1993, he was elected Chairman of the [[Estonian Coalition Party]]. The parliamentary elections of March 1995 gave victory to the KMÜ coalition, comprising the [[Estonian Coalition Party]] and the [[People's Union of Estonia]] Parties. As leader of the Estonian Coalition Party, Vähi was asked by [[President of Estonia|President]] [[Lennart Meri]] to form a government. Appointed Prime Minister for the second time in his career, he formed a coalition government of the KMÜ and the Estonian Centre Party, which was sworn in on 17 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Raun, Toivo U. ''Estonia and the Estonians''. Stanford, Calif: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8179-2852-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second term as Prime Minister was quite rocky. On 11 October 1995 several ministers resigned from the cabinet, causing the [[Estonian Centre Party]] to withdraw from the government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Tapes Scandal Topples Rulers In Estonia. ''The Washington Post''. 	12 Oct 1995 [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/19419031.html?dids=19419031:19419031&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+12%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Tapes+Scandal+Topples+Rulers+In+Estonia&amp;pqatl=google link]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 November 1995, Vähi reformed the government, this time with the help of the [[Estonian Reform Party]]. This collaboration lasted less than a year; on 20 November 1996, six ministers, including then-[[Estonian Foreign Minister|Foreign Minister]] [[Siim Kallas]], resigned, causing a collapse of the collaboration between the Coalition Party and the Reform Party. On 1 December 1996, Vähi once again reformed the government; however, this time, he only used members of his own party, thus greatly reducing its ability to retain power. On 7 February 1995, Vähi survived a [[no-confidence]] vote, 46–45. Feeling pressure from within his own party, he resigned on 25 February 1997. Three days later, on 27 February, President Lennart Meri named [[Mart Siimann]] as the new Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Estonia Names New Prime Minister

He is currently a member of the free-market liberal Reform Party but is not active in politics and has concentrated on his career as a businessman. He has expressed opinion that Estonia needs to improve relations with Russia&lt;ref&gt;[https://majandus24.postimees.ee/3747157/vahi-venemaa-vastane-sojatorvik-kahjustab-ari Vähi: Venemaa vastane sõjatõrvik kahjustab äri]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Joseph Whitaker I''' (1755-1838) was the son of a [[Leeds]] cloth manufacturer; he came to America as a British soldier during the [[American Revolution]] and deserted, settling in Pennsylvania near [[Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site|Hopewell Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pennypacker |first= Samuel Whitaker |authorlink= Samuel W.

==Second Generation==
* '''James Whitaker''' (1782-1875) began producing nails in Philadelphia about 1805, and in 1816 he and his brother Joseph II leased a rolling mill at the Falls of the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]], beginning a long series of investments in the iron trade. He was the managing partner at the [[Phoenix Iron Works (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Phoenix Iron Works]] for several years and later was active in family interests at Reading. In 1846 he returned to Philadelphia and mostly retired from iron work, although he remained an investor in several enterprises. He became a [[Society of Friends|Quaker]] late in life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=jwbittner&amp;id=I2432 transcribed bio, supposedly by Samuel Pennypacker]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Joseph Whitaker (industrialist)|Joseph Whitaker II]]''' (1789-1870) was a prominent ironmaster, businessman, and politician.  He was the ironmaster at the [[Phoenix Iron Works (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Phoenix Iron Works]], the [[Principio Furnace]], and owned parts of these businesses and others, along with others of his family.
* '''Francis A. Whitaker''' (1799-1876), brother of Joseph Whitaker II, was also an ironmaster. He operated the Matilda Furnace, [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin County]], Pennsylvania in 1848-9,&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania State Reports, vol. 18, vol. 6, Philadelphia, 1853, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt; and may have operated the Elk Iron Works near Elkton, Maryland. His son William H. Whitaker (1835-1920) was a president and owner of the [[Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball team of 1882-1890.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', Oct. 5, 1920, obituary "William H. Whitaker"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Price Whitaker''' (1803-1890), brother of Joseph Whitaker II, was his partner in most of his enterprises. He received his early training at an iron works in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]] and also saved enough money to receive some formal education in [[Philadelphia]]. He went on to manage a forge near [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His first investments were in a rolling mill near [[Elkton, Maryland|Elkton]], [[Maryland]] and (with his brother James) a forge in [[North East, Maryland|North East]], Maryland, which he managed for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Cyclopedia of Representative Men of Maryland and Washington, DC'', National Biographical Publishing Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 1879, pp. 661-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 George and his brother Joseph Whitaker II purchased the Principio Furnace and related properties, which had been in ruins since being burned during the [[War of 1812]], and rebuilt. In 1845 George, Joseph, W. P. C. Whitaker and a partner built an ironworks at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], [[Maryland]]. In 1848 George, Joseph, and partners purchased the old Durham Furnace (once run by [[George Taylor (delegate)|George Taylor]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]) in [[Durham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Durham Township]], Pennsylvania and revived that. In 1855 George and Joseph purchased an interest in the Crescent Iron Works in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] in what was then Virginia. At the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] George and Joseph divided their properties, George receiving the Maryland and Virginia share, Joseph the Pennsylvania holdings. In 1863 George purchased the Crescent ironworks outright and ran it until 1868, when it was bought by others. George repurchased the works after the owners went bankrupt and created the "Whitaker Iron Company", with George as president and his son [[Nelson E. Whitaker]] as secretary. George P. Whitaker served one term in the Maryland legislature, in 1867, and also represented Maryland on the board of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].

==Third Generation==
* '''William P. C. Whitaker''' (1812-1888), eldest son of Joseph Whitaker II, helped run the family furnaces at Principio and erected new ones at Havre de Grace, Maryland. 
* '''Joseph Coudon''' (III) (1823-1880), a member of a wealthy Maryland family (owner of the estate [[Woodlands (Perryville, Maryland)|Woodlands]]), married Caroline Whitaker (1833-1898), daughter of George Price Whitaker, in 1854. He became a partner in Whitaker &amp; Coudon, which sold iron products from the family furnaces and elsewhere in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of a Pennsylvanian, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1918, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Joseph Rusling Whitaker''' (1824-1895), son of Joseph Whitaker II, helped his brother William erect ironworks at Havre de Grace, Maryland in 1845 and became for ten years the family's manager at the Durham Iron Works after his father and uncle purchased it in 1848. He was later president of the Swede Iron Company and made lucrative investments in street railways in Philadelphia. In 1878 he moved to Delaware and was a delegate to the national Republican convention of 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rusling Whitaker 1824-1895 and His Progenitors, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1895, p. 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Whitaker''' (1826-1891), son of Joseph Whitaker II, served as president of the Saucon Iron Company in [[Hellertown, Pennsylvania|Hellertown]], Pennsylvania, in which he and his brother Joseph R. Whitaker had shares.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistics of the American and Foreign Iron Trades for 1891'', American Iron and Steel Association, Philadelphia, 1892, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nelson E. Whitaker|Nelson Evans Whitaker]] (1839-1909) was the son of George Price Whitaker and inherited a share of his iron and steel interests in West Virginia and Maryland. He ran the businesses successfully and became a politician in West Virginia as well, serving as president of the state senate 1897-9.
* '''Edmund Simmons Whitaker''' (1838-1898) was another son of George Price Whitaker. He managed the Durham Iron Works in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and the Principio Furnace for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/md/cecil/bios/whitaker-es.txt bio of E. S. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth Generation==
* '''[[Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker]]''' (1843-1916) was a grandson of Joseph Whitaker II; he was a judge, historian, and governor of Pennsylvania. As a young man he worked at the firm of Whitaker &amp; Coudon, iron merchants, in Philadelphia, which sold iron from the family ironworks and other furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of a Pennsylvanian, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1918, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Joseph Coudon (IV)''' (1858-1940), grandson of George Price Whitaker, was one of the executors of George Price Whitaker's will, and helped to defend the actions of the executors from legal challenges by some of the other members of the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantic Reporter'', volume 100, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He had large land holdings in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], Maryland, was the president of several banks there, and was a director of the Wheeling Steel Company at his death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Midland Journal'', February 23, 1940, "Joseph Coudon Passes Away"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alexander Glass''' (1858-1941) was a son-in-law of Nelson E. Whitaker. After working for both the LaBelle Iron Works in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], [[Ohio]] (which his father Andrew Glass had helped found) and Whitaker family steel plants, he started the Wheeling Corrugating Company, with the help of an investment from his father-in-law.  It was the first firm in Wheeling to make zinc-coated steel, corrugated for strength, for building, and it was a success. In 1919 Glass' company, the La Belle Iron Works, the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and the Wheeling Steel and Iron Company combined to form the Wheeling Steel Corporation, which Glass later led until his death in 1941. Wheeling Steel merged with Pittsburgh Steel to form [[Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheeling.weirton.lib.wv.us/history/people/hallfame/1980glas.htm Wheeling Hall of Fame entry for Alexander Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Glass incidentally made Wheeling, West Virginia famous by placing a large red "Wheeling" label on the company's garbage pails, which were widely used.
* '''Albert C. Whitaker''' (1867-1951) was a son of Nelson E. Whitaker; he served as president of the Whitaker Iron Company, the Wheeling Corrugating Company, and the Riverside Bridge Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindapages.com/wags-ohio/progwv-159.jpg bio of Albert C. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from business in 1921.
* '''Nelson Price Whitaker''' (1873-1922) was a grandson of George Price Whitaker (through his son Cecil, who predeceased him). He helped manage the family businesses, serving in 1910 as the general manager of the Whitaker-Glessner Company, Wheeling Corrugating Company, and the Portsmouth Steel Company.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial World, Vol. 44, issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1916, and was chairman of the state Highway Commission until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News, August 1922, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dwight Homans Wagner''' (1874-1958) married Eliza "Elsie" Whitaker (1874-1931), daughter of Nelson E. Whitaker. Trained as an architect at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], Wagner was put to work running the family enterprises, serving as an officer in various Whitaker companies and running his own business manufacturing concrete blocks, bridge piers, and other forms. He eventually served as president of Alexander Glass' Wheeling Corrugating Company, by then a subsidiary of the Whitaker-Glessner Company.&lt;ref&gt;''The Iron Age'', Feb. 10, 1916, p. 384, "Whitaker-Glessner Company's Year" (Wagner a director of the Whitaker-Glessner Company)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvgenweb.org/ohio/wvirginians-7.jpg Wagner bio with picture at wvgenweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of an illness at the age of 44.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/wv/ohio/bios/g4200001.txt History of West Virginia, Old and New, Vol. 2, American Historical Society, 1923, p. 68-9]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Parks Whitaker''' (1891-1948) was the son of Albert C. Whitaker. A [[Princeton University]] graduate, he helped run some of the Whitaker family enterprises, serving as secretary/treasurer of the Whitaker Iron Company, assistant treasurer of the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and assistant treasurer of the Wheeling Corrugating Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/wv/ohio/bios/w3260001.txt bio of G. P. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Generation==
* '''George Parks Whitaker Jr.''' (1922-2003) was the son of George Parks Whitaker. He served in the Army Air Force (Air Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross) during World War II, graduated from [[Kenyon College]], and traveled around Europe, meeting his future wife Anita Malmstrom while working at the Sandvik Steel Works in Sweden.

'''William Davidson''' (1740 – 17 June 1790) was a [[Scottish-Canadian]] [[lumber]] merchant, [[shipbuilder]] and politician. He was the first permanent [[European ethnic groups|European]] settler on the [[Miramichi River]] in the Canadian [[Province]] of [[New Brunswick]].

== Arrival in the New World ==
Davidson was born in [[Cowford, Moray|Cowford]], in the [[Parish of Bellie]], [[Moray]], [[Scotland]], and was engaged in [[Salmo salar|salmon]] fishing as a young man (see [[River Spey]]). He was born '''John Godsman''', but changed his name to William Davidson after his grandfather. In 1765 he arrived in [[Nova Scotia]] and obtained extensive land grants, he and a partner getting 100,000 acres (400&amp;nbsp;km²), of which 2/3 was Davidson's share. This amounted to a strip of {{convert|13|mi|km}} on either side of the [[Miramichi River]] (then a part of Nova Scotia) with fishing and lumbering rights. He was required to clear and improve the land and establish one Protestant settler for every two acres (8,000 m²). He settled many people on the Miramichi. Davidson is best known as the first settler in the Miramichi.

== Founding a colony ==
Davidson went to [[New England]] in 1766 to recruit settlers and supplies. Soon he was shipping fish to the [[West Indies]] and furs and fish to [[Europe]]. To employ his workers in the winter he began to cut lumber and brought out from Great Britain a master shipbuilder, [[shipwright]]s and other craftsmen.

Throughout his life this visionary, practical, industrious and intelligent man was plagued by bad luck. His first locally built ship, the ''Miramichi'', sank off [[Spain]] on her maiden voyage and his second ship was wrecked in 1775 off the northern tip of [[Prince Edward Island]]. But, other cargoes got through and he soon had a seven-year contract with a British firm to supply fish and lumber.

== The American Revolution and the Saint John River ==

In 1776 the [[American Revolutionary War]], came along and New England [[privateers]] made sailing in the North Atlantic unsafe and rebel sympathizers stirred up the neighbouring [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] Indian nation. With shipping so hazardous, the British firm he contracted with was soon bankrupt.

The Mi'kmaq began raids on the Miramichi settlers, and in 1777 Davidson withdrew inland with his employees to Maugerville, a settlement on the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] downstream from the site of present city of [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]]. Ever industrious, Davidson soon secured a contract to transport ship's masts and yards down the Saint John River to the port of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] for shipment to the [[Royal Navy]].

In 1783 Davidson was elected a member of the [[Nova Scotia]] [[House of Assembly]] for [[Sunbury County]]. The [[American Revolutionary War]] was now over and Davidson moved back to the Miramichi Valley to secure his land grants. He went by ship with his employees and stopped en route at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] for supplies.

== Back to the Miramichi ==
Davidson lost no time on his return to the Miramichi. Most of his employees came with him. He spent 5,000 [[pounds sterling]] on a shipyard, a sawmill and stores and other buildings and was soon back in business. In the period 1783 to 1785 he lost several more vessels and their cargoes to the North Atlantic. But some got through and he signed a contract with Wm. Forsyth and Co. of [[Greenock]], Scotland and Halifax, Nova Scotia to provide masts and yards. He also shipped fish to the [[West Indies]] and [[Europe]].

To provide another source of revenue, Davidson sent out employees to fish for [[cod]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].

But [[United Empire Loyalists]] were pouring into the [[Maritime Provinces]] and in 1784 Loyalist settlers in the Saint John River Valley set up New Brunswick as a separate colony. They were land hungry and revoked Davidson's grant on the grounds that he had not brought out the settlers he promised. He was compensated with a grant of 14,500 acres (59&amp;nbsp;km²), including the sites of his enterprises.

William Davidson was elected as representative from [[Northumberland County, New Brunswick|Northumberland County]] to the [[1st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]] and served from 1786 until his death.

Davidson was out on snowshoes on business in the winter of 1790, when he was caught in a blizzard. He suffered severely and caught a cold from which he did not recover. He died in June, 1790.

== Family and legacy ==

When he was living at Maugerville, Davidson married Sarah Nevers. They had five children.

One of his brothers settled close to him. Many thousands of people in the Miramichi and across North America are descendants of the Davidson brothers. He died on 17 June 1790.

Davidson was complimented by a contemporary for his "...genius and high abilities". He must be seen in the context of the great age of the Scottish people. His personal characteristics, industry, vision, practical ability, persistence, and intelligence are the hallmarks of a people who were pioneers in exploration  ([[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] and [[David Livingstone]]), industry ([[Andrew Carnegie]]), science (Kelvin), philosophy ([[David Hume]]) and politics( [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]). Davidson accomplished much, was not deterred by misfortunes which would discourage most, and was the true founder of a distinctive people, the Miramichiers.

== Portrait ==

A large portrait of William Davidson felling trees on the Miramichi hangs on an internal staircase of the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Alberta]]. This is very appropriate as Davidson was a native of [[Morayshire|Moray]], very near the boundary with [[Banffshire]], [[Scotland]].

The painting has been in the possession of the hotel for many years, and hotel staff believe that it was painted in the last years of the 19th century. It identifies Davidson as Canada's first lumberman, surely a misnomer. He was, perhaps, the first English speaking person to establish a significant commercial lumber business in Canada. But long before, French settlers cut trees for their own use and for local markets.
