'''Archetypal literary criticism''' is a type of [[critical theory]] that interprets a text by focusing on recurring [[mythology|myths]] and archetypes (from the Greek ''archē'', "beginning", and ''typos'', "imprint") in the [[narrative]], [[symbols]], [[image]]s, and character types in literary work. As a form of literary criticism, it dates back to 1934 when [[Maud Bodkin]] published ''[[Archetypal Patterns in Poetry]]''.

Archetypal literary criticism's origins are rooted in two other academic disciplines, [[social anthropology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]; each contributed to literary criticism in separate ways, with the latter being a sub-branch of critical theory. Archetypal criticism was at its most popular in the 1940s and 1950s, largely due to the work of Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]]. Though archetypal literary criticism is no longer widely practiced, nor have there been any major developments in the field, it still has a place in the tradition of literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devika|first1=S.|title=Archetypal Criticism|url=https://drdevika.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/archetypal-criticism/|website=Dr. S.

==Origins==

===Frazer===
The anthropological origins of archetypal criticism can pre-date its analytical psychology origins by over 30 years. ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), written by the Scottish anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]], was the first influential text dealing with cultural mythologies. Frazer was part of a group of comparative anthropologists working out of [[Cambridge University]] who worked extensively on the topic. ''The Golden Bough'' was widely accepted as the seminal text on myth that spawned numerous studies on the same subject. Eventually, the momentum of Frazer's work carried over into literary studies.

In ''The Golden Bough'' Frazer identifies practices and mythological beliefs shared among primitive religions and modern religions. Frazer argues that the death-rebirth myth is present in almost all cultural mythologies, and is acted out in terms of growing seasons and vegetation. The myth is symbolized by the death (i.e., final harvest) and rebirth (i.e., spring) of the god of vegetation. As an example, Frazer cites the Greek myth of [[Persephone]], who was taken to the [[Underworld]] by [[Hades]]. Her mother [[Demeter]], the goddess of the harvest, was so sad that she struck the world with fall and winter. While in the underworld [[Persephone]] ate six of the twelve pomegranate seeds given to her by Hades; consequently, she was forced to spend half the year, from then on, in the Underworld, representative of autumn and winter, or the death in the death-rebirth myth.  The other half of the year Persephone was permitted to be with Demeter in the mortal realm, which represents spring and summer, or the rebirth in the death-rebirth myth.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Jung===
While Frazer's work deals with mythology and archetypes in material terms, the work of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the Swiss-born founder of analytical psychology, is, in contrast, immaterial in its focus. Jung's work theorizes about myths and archetypes in relation to the [[Collective unconscious|unconscious]], an inaccessible part of the mind. From a Jungian perspective, myths are the "culturally elaborated representations of the contents of the deepest recess of the human psyche: the world of the archetypes" (Walker 4).

Jungian analytical psychology distinguishes between the personal and [[collective unconscious]], the latter being particularly relevant to archetypal criticism. The collective unconscious, or the [[objective psyche]] as it is less frequently known, is a number of innate thoughts, feelings, instincts, and memories that reside in the unconsciousness of all people. Jung's definition of the term is inconsistent in his many writings. At one time he calls the collective unconscious the "a priori, inborn forms of intuition" (Lietch 998), while in another instance it is a series of "experience(s) that come upon us like fate" (998). Regardless of the many nuances between Jung's definitions, the collective unconsciousness is a shared part of the unconscious.

To Jung, an archetype in the collective unconscious, as quoted from Leitch et al., is "irrepresentable, but has effects which make visualizations of it possible, namely, the archetypal images and ideas" (988), due to the fact they are at an inaccessible part of the  mind. The archetypes to which Jung refers are represented through primordial images, a term he coined. Primordial images originate from the initial stages of humanity and have been part of the collective unconscious ever since. It is through primordial images that universal archetypes are experienced, and more importantly, that the unconscious is revealed.

With the same death-rebirth myth that Frazer sees as being representative of the growing seasons and agriculture as a point of comparison, a Jungian analysis envisions the death-rebirth archetype as a "symbolic expression of a process taking place not in the world but in the mind. That process is the return of the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] to the unconscious—a kind of temporary death of the ego—and its re-emergence, or rebirth, from the unconscious" (Segal 4).

By itself, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates the height of archetypal literary criticism by over a decade. The Jungian archetypal approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed.

===Frye===
Bodkin's ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'', the first work on the subject of archetypal literary criticism, applies Jung's theories about the collective unconscious, archetypes, and primordial images to literature. It was not until the work of the Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] that archetypal criticism was theorized in purely literary terms. The major work of Frye's to deal with archetypes is ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''
but his essay "The Archetypes of Literature" is a precursor to the book. Frye's thesis in "The Archetypes of Literature" remains largely unchanged in ''Anatomy of Criticism''. Frye's work helped displace [[New Criticism]] as the major mode of analyzing literary texts, before giving way to [[structuralism]] and [[semiotics]].

Frye's work breaks from both Frazer and Jung in such a way that it is distinct from its anthropological and psychoanalytical precursors. For Frye, the death-rebirth myth, that Frazer sees manifest in agriculture and the harvest, is not ritualistic since it is involuntary, and therefore, must be done. As for Jung, Frye was uninterested about the collective unconscious on the grounds of feeling it was unnecessary: since the unconscious is unknowable it cannot be studied. How archetypes came to be was also of no concern to Frye; rather, the function and effect of archetypes is his interest. For Frye, literary archetypes "play an essential role in refashioning the material universe into an alternative verbal universe that is humanly intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential human needs and concerns" (Abrams 224-225).

There are two basic categories in Frye's framework, comedic and tragic. Each category is further subdivided into two categories: [[comedy]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] for the comedic; [[tragedy]] and [[satire]] (or ironic) for the tragic. Though he is dismissive of Frazer, Frye uses the seasons in his archetypal schema. Each season is aligned with a literary genre: comedy with spring, romance with summer, tragedy with autumn, and satire with winter.

Comedy is aligned with spring because the genre of comedy is characterized by the birth of the hero, revival and [[resurrection]]. Also, spring symbolizes the defeat of winter and darkness. Romance and summer are paired together because summer is the culmination of life in the seasonal calendar, and the romance genre culminates with some sort of triumph, usually a marriage. Autumn is the dying stage of the seasonal calendar, which parallels the tragedy genre because it is, above all, known for the "fall" or demise of the protagonist. Satire is [[Metonymy|metonymized]] with winter on the grounds that satire is a "dark" genre; satire is a disillusioned and mocking form of the three other genres. It is noted for its darkness, dissolution, the return of chaos, and the defeat of the heroic figure.

Summer – Romance. The birth of the hero.
Autumn – Tragedy. Movement towards the death or defeat of the hero.
Winter – Irony/Satire. The hero is absent. 
Spring – Comedy. The rebirth of the hero.

The context of a genre determines how a symbol or image is to be interpreted. Frye outlines five different spheres in his schema: human, animal, vegetation, mineral, and water. The comedic human world is representative of wish-fulfillment and being community centred. In contrast, the tragic human world is of isolation, tyranny, and the fallen hero. Animals in the comedic genres are docile and pastoral (e.g. sheep), while animals are predatory and hunters in the tragic (e.g. wolves). For the realm of vegetation, the comedic is, again, pastoral but also represented by gardens, parks, roses and lotuses. As for the tragic, vegetation is of a wild forest, or as being barren. Cities, a temple, or precious stones represent the comedic mineral realm. The tragic mineral realm is noted for being a [[desert]], [[ruins]], or "of sinister geometrical images" (Frye 1456). Lastly, the water realm is represented by rivers in the comedic. With the tragic, the seas, and especially [[floods]], signify the water sphere.

Frye admits that his schema in "The Archetypes of Literature" is simplistic, but makes room for exceptions by noting that there are neutral archetypes. The example he cites are islands such as [[Circe]]'s or [[Prospero]]'s which cannot be categorized under the tragic or comedic.

==Other contributors==
Maud Bodkin wrote ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'' in 1934, applying the ideas of Jung to poetry, and examining archetypes such as the ancient mariner and rebirth, heaven and hell, images of the devil, the hero and God. 
Bodkin book.

In his 1949 book ''Hero with a Thousand Faces'', [[Joseph Campbell]] pioneered the idea of the ‘monomyth' (though the term was borrowed from James Joyce), a universal pattern in heroic tales across different cultures and genres. His deep examination of the eight step hero's journey (and the common variations that exist) had a huge impact on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, and continues to inspire creative artists today.

==Theory critiques==
It has been argued that Frye's version of archetypal criticism strictly categorizes works based on their genres, which determines how an archetype is to be interpreted in a text. According to this argument the dilemma Frye's archetypal criticism faces with more [[contemporary literature]], and that of [[post-modernism]] in general, is that genres and categories are no longer distinctly separate and that the very concept of genres has become blurred, thus problematizing Frye's schema. For instance [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'' is considered a [[tragicomedy]], a play with elements of tragedy and satire, with the implication that interpreting textual elements in the play becomes difficult as  the two opposing seasons and conventions that Frye associated with genres are pitted against each other. But in fact arguments about generic blends such as tragicomedy go back to the [[Renaissance]], and Frye always conceived of genres as fluid. Frye thought literary forms were part of a great circle and were capable of shading into other generic forms. (He contemplated including a diagram of his wheel in ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' but thought better of it.)Myth and archetype deals with origin of literary.

== Examples of archetypes in literature ==
* [[Femme fatale|Femme Fatale]]: A female character type who brings upon catastrophic and disastrous events. [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] from the story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] or [[Pandora]] from Greek mythology are two such figures.
* The Journey: A narrative archetype where the protagonist must overcome a series of obstacles before reaching his or her goal. The quintessential journey archetype in Western culture is arguably [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Archetypal symbols vary more than archetype narratives or character types. The best archetypal pattern is any symbol with deep roots in a culture's mythology, such as the [[forbidden fruit]] in Genesis or even the poison apple in [[Snow White]]. These are examples of symbols that resonate with archetypal critics.

Archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies. This archetype may create a shared imaginary which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4365">The '''Artist Placement Group''' (APG) was conceived by Barbara Steveni in London in 1965,&lt;ref name="founded-apg"&gt;{{cite web| title = e-flux: Artist Placement Group, APG | url = http://e-flux.com/timebank/event/artist-placement-group-apg | date = 2012-02-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established in 1966 as an artist-run organisation seeking to refocus art outside the gallery, predominantly through attaching an artist in a business or governmental context for a period of time.

Industrial placements included the [[British Steel Corporation]] and Ocean Fleets Ltd., and governmental placements included the [[Department of the Environment]], the [[Scottish Office]] and the [[Department for Health and Social Security]].&lt;ref name="CHW"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Naomi Hennig and Ulrike Jordan|title=Context is Half the Work|year=2016|publisher=Summerhall|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4-9}}

As well as these placements, the organisation exhibited in galleries - for example in INN70 at the Hayward Gallery in London,1971 and other venues including a retrospective review at [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in 1977 and at [[Documenta|documenta 6]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APG: Artist Placement Group|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/artistplacementgroup/chronology.htm|website=Tate|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the participants were Barbara Steveni, [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]], [[Maurice Agis]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Ian Breakwell]], [[Stuart Brisley]], [[Hugh Davies (composer)|Hugh Davies]], Andrew Dipper, [[Barry Flanagan]], [[David Hall (video artist)|David Hall]], Ian Macdonald Munro, [[Yoko Ono]], Anna Ridley, [[Jeffrey Shaw]], [[David Toop]], and the [[Fluxus]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation and Imagination (formerly APG, the Artist Placement Group)|url=http://www.slashseconds.org/issues/002/004/articles/bsteveni2/index.php|website=/seconds|publisher=Peter Lewis|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989 the organisation became known as ''Organisation and Imagination'' (O+I).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://en.contextishalfthework.net/about-apg/timeline/|website=Artist Placement Group|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Tate Archive in London purchased the APG records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=artist placement group|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/artistplacementgroup/|website=Tate|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012 [[Raven Row]] Gallery, London, revisited APG's early years by staging a major retrospective of work carried out including examples of some of its placements together with related documentation much of it loaned by the Tate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Individual and the Organisation: Artist Placement Group 1966-79|url=http://www.ravenrow.org/exhibition/artist_placement_group/|website=Raven Row|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further retrospective occurred in 2015 at Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien in Berlin, forming the basis for a further exhibition at [[Summerhall]], Edinburgh in 2016.&lt;ref name="CHW"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/14639402.Fringe_show_to_tell_untold_story_of_radical_1970s_artists_explorations_in_industry/|title=Fringe show to tell untold story of radical 1970s artists explorations in industry by Artist Placement Group|last=Miller|first=Phil|date=25 July 2016|work=Glasgow Herald|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''association copy''' is a term used to describe a copy of a [[book]] which once belonged to the author or someone connected with the author. It can also apply to a copy that once belonged to someone particularly associated with its contents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An association copy is often also a [[presentation copy]], in which the author gives the book to a friend, [[colleague]], notable person, or someone upon whom a [[Fictional character|character]] in the book is thought or known to have been based.

Association copies are highly [[collectable]]. 

An example of an association copy is Herman Melville's copy of ''The Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whaleship Essex of Nantucket'' that contains 18 pages of Melville's notes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Berlin Biennale''' (full name: Berlin Biennale für zeitgenössische Kunst, Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art) is a [[contemporary art]] exhibition, which has been held at various locations in [[Berlin]], Germany, every two to three years since 1998.

It was curated by [[Saskia Bos]], who adopted the theme of "connectedness, contribution and commitment" and sought to reject commercially oriented art while fostering engagement with the public in order to "exhibit a utopian sociability in art".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Monk, "2nd Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art", ''Parachute'', 1 October 2001 ([http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-30203328.html Online] at Highbeam, subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Works were again exhibited at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art and the postal centre in Oranienburger Straße as well as under the elevated [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] at Jannowitzbrücke and the Allianz Building, known as the [[Treptowers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102525/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/2-biennale 2.

===3rd Berlin Biennale===
The Third Berlin Biennale took place from 14 February to 18 April 2004 and was directed by [[Ute Meta Bauer]], who chose five themes, or "hubs," titled Migration, Urban Conditions, Sonic Landscapes, Modes and Scenes, and Other Cinema, in order to focus on artistic conversation and on the specific circumstances of post-[[Cold War]] Berlin. The Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art was again used as a site; additional sites included the [[Martin Gropius Bau]] and, for the exhibition of 35 cinematic works, the cinema Kino Arsenal at [[Potsdamer Platz]]. There were several collaborations with various Berlin cultural institutions, a partnership with the Friends of the [[Deutsche Kinemathek]], and a weekly special radio broadcast, reboot.fm. The event ended with a three-day multi-media ''Performance Jam'' on the final weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102537/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/3-biennale 3.

The Fourth Berlin Biennale ran from 25 March to 5 June 2006, curated by [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], and [[Ali Subotnick]], known collectively as the [[Wrong Gallery]] after a project they did in New York.

===6th Berlin Biennale===
The Sixth Berlin Biennale ran from 11 June to 8 August 2010 and was headed by [[Kathrin Rhomberg]]. It was preceded by Project Artists Beyond, sponsored by the [[European Commission]], which sought to showcase the process of artistic creation through exhibits in public places. This began in January and involved seven artists in [[Amsterdam]], [[Istanbul]], [[Pristina]], Copenhagen, [[Vienna]], and Paris in addition to Berlin. The title of this Biennale was ''was draußen wartet'' (what is waiting out there) and the guiding question was "Glauben Sie an die Wirklichkeit?" (Do you believe in reality?). More than 40 artists were featured. Rhomberg chose sites in parts of the city inhabited by large numbers of migrants and invited the New York art critic [[Michael Fried]] to mount an exhibition on the drawings of the 19th-century artist [[Adolph Menzel]] in association with the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Museum of Prints and Drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Münter, [http://www.de-cn.net/mag/bku/de6029924.htm 6.

The 9th Berlin Biennale stirred some controversy among critics and audiences. James Farago, of ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote a scathing review, describing the art event as “an ultra-slick, ultra-sarcastic biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen.” 

Other critics lauded the Biennale; in the September 2016 Issue of Artforum, British artist [[Hannah Black]] wrote that “…They [DIS] have been greeted, just like the modernist avant-gardes were in their time, with accusations of bad politics and even worse taste. Perhaps these critics haven’t noticed: The world is a ruin, but we go on living in it…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Hannah|title=the 9th Berlin Biennale|url=https://www.artforum.com/inprint/issue=201607&amp;id=63010|publisher=Artforum|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Piero Bisello concluded that “Regardless of what we thought Berlin Biennale 2016 would be, we can now claim it is for us a milestone in art history, whether by that history we mean the last centuries, the last years, the last days, the last hours, the last fashion seasons.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bisello|first1=Piero|title=Berlin Biennale 2016: last goodbye to the prematurely dead post-internet label|url=https://www.conceptualfinearts.com/cfa/2016/06/07/berlin-biennale-2016-last-goodbye-to-the-prematurely-dead-post-internet-label/|publisher=Conceptual Fine Arts|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tess Edmonson wrote For ''Art Agenda'' that “As a whole, the biennial articulates the sense that disengaging from networks of capital and power is neither effective nor interesting nor possible, instead performing its own complicity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edmonson|first1=Tess|title='The Present in Drag,' 9th Berlin Biennale|url=http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/%E2%80%9Cthe-present-in-drag%E2%80%9D-9th-berlin-biennale/|publisher=Art Agenda|date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later art historian [[:de:Susanne von Falkenhausen|Susanne von Falkenhausen]] commented on the controversial nature of the 9th Biennale: "Finding myself confronted with such a unified front of fantasies, rhetorics, pretensions and desires for authenticity in 2017, I confess that I revised my reaction to DIS’s 2016 Berlin Biennale 9, ‘The Present in Drag’. That exhibition rigorously, to the point of cynicism, followed the web 2.0 world of digital prosumer reality and the moral ambiguity of its promises and aesthetics. In my view, it catered to a young, white, middle-class audience, but now it strikes me as more realistic than what we are seeing today: an outsourcing to the (post-)colonial other of the political, guilt, spiritual desire and collectivity that plague the Western-Northern self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=von Falkenhausen|first1=Susanne|title=Get Real|url=https://frieze.com/article/get-real-0|publisher=FRIEZE|date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Basic taste qualities like sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami serve specific functions in identifying food components found in the diet of humans and animals, and are recognized by proteins in the oral cavity. Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 670 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds.

==Database overview==

===Bitter compounds===
[[File:Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB.jpg|frame|right|alt=|Search Examples of bitter compounds in BitterDB]]
'''BitterDB''' currently contains more than 670 compounds that were cited in the literature as bitter. For each compound, the database offers information regarding its molecular properties, references for the compound’s bitterness, including additional information about the bitterness category of the compound (e.g. a ‘bitter-sweet’ or ‘slightly bitter’ annotation), different compound identifiers (smiles, CAS registry number, IUPAC systematic name), an indication whether the compound is derived from a natural source or is synthetic, a link to the compound’s [[PubChem]] entry and different file formats for downloading (sdf, image, smiles).
Over 200 bitter compounds have been experimentally linked to their corresponding human bitter taste receptors. For those compounds, BitterDB provides additional information, including links to the publications indicating these ligand–receptor interactions, the effective concentration for receptor activation and/or the [[EC50]] value and links to the associated bitter taste receptors entries in the '''BitterDB'''.

====Querying and browsing====
Bitter compounds can be queried and browsed in different ways. For example, 'advanced search' option allows user to retrieve compounds that fit different criteria, such as a combination of specific physical properties or a combination of associated human bitter taste receptors.
In addition to the querying options the user can browse through a sort-able table with all the '''BitterDB''' compounds.

===Bitter taste receptors===
In addition, '''BitterDB''' contains data about the 25 known human bitter taste receptors. Several properties are displayed for each receptor. The bitter taste receptors can be searched using different criteria: name, known ligands and [[UniProt]] accession number. Using a table that presents all the bitter taste receptors and some information about them, the user can browse and also sort by various options, such as the number of bitter ligands associated with the receptor.

===Local BLAST service and global alignment===
'''BitterDB''' offers two additional features: a local [[BLAST]] service to determine the local similarity between a query sequence and the different human bitter taste receptors, and a global alignment of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. The alignment was generated using [[Clustalw|ClustalW2]], and displays the secondary structure of each receptor, as predicted by the TOPCONS server.

===Users can upload bitter compounds===
'''BitterDB''' offers an ‘upload’ option, by which the users are encouraged to submit information about bitter compounds. These data will be reviewed by the authors and uploaded to the database accordingly. The users can join the mailing list in order to receive database updates.

The '''British National Opera Company''' presented opera in English in London and on tour in the British provinces between 1922 and 1929. It was founded in December 1921 by singers and instrumentalists from [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]]'s [[Beecham opera company]] (1915–1920), which was disbanded when financial problems over buying [[Thomas_Beecham#The_Bedford_Estate|The Bedford Estate]] forced Beecham to withdraw from the music scene for a short period. The new venture was financed by the issue of 40,000 preference shares at £1 each.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 July 1921, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Among the musicians who met at the inaugural meeting of the new enterprise at the [[Queen's Hall]] were [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Sir Charles Stanford]], [[Harry Plunket Greene]], [[Aylmer Buesst]] and [[William Henry Hadow|Sir Henry Hadow]]. The new company bought the entire assets of the Beecham company, comprising the scenery, costumes, scores, instruments and performing rights for 48 operas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1921, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nellie Melba 1.jpg|right|150px|thumbnail|[[Nellie Melba]], who appeared with the company at Covent Garden]]The company's first performance was ''[[Aida]]'' at [[Bradford]] in February 1922, and received excellent notices.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 February 1922, p. 8 and ''The Manchester Guardian'', 10 February 1922, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its existence the company toured in the provinces, but also had short seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] (1922–1924) and then at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=ency&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O76-BritishNationalOperaCmpny.html BNOC on encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1923 Covent Garden season [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] emerged from retirement to sing with the company. She gave her services free of charge, to support the company. She did not, however, feel equal to relearning her old roles in English translation, and she sang in Italian while the rest of the company sang in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 January 1923, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The British National Opera Company was a pioneer of broadcast opera, with excerpts from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' broadcast live from the [[Royal Opera House]] by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Company]] in January 1923, less than a year after the foundation of both the BBC and the opera company.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1923, p. 8 and ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 10 January 1923, p. 10. However, [[Harold Rosenthal]] in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'' states that the BNOC gave "the first broadcast in Europe of a complete opera" from "the company's matinée performance of [[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)| Hänsel und Gretel]] at Covent Garden on 6 January 1923", but this conflicts not only with the ''Times'' and ''Guardian'' reports, but with the BBC's schedules: daily broadcasts did not begin until 5.00 p.m, too late for a relay of a matinée.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's first artistic director was [[Percy Pitt]], who had been music director with the Grand Opera Syndicate and who later worked as Director of Music for the [[BBC]]. His successor in 1924 was [[baritone]] [[Frederic Austin]], who in 1920 arranged the music for a revival of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)]].&lt;ref name=divine&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.divine-art.com/AS/BNOC.htm# |title=BNOC on Divineart.com |access-date=3 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118081729/http://www.divine-art.com/AS/BNOC.htm# |archive-date=18 November 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company had a wide repertory, which included works by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Italian opera]] and several English works, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'' and [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Perfect Fool]]'' and ''[[At the Boar's Head]]''.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; The ''New Grove Dictionary of Opera'' singled out the company's staging of the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'', ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'' and "a notable production in English of ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' with [[Maggie Teyte]]."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

British National Opera Company employed most of the leading British and British-based singers and conductors of that time, including conductors [[John Barbirolli]], [[Adrian Boult]], Aylmer Buesst, [[Hamilton Harty]], [[Gervase Hughes]] and [[Malcolm Sargent]], and singers [[Agnes Nicholls]], [[Florence Austral]], [[Joseph Hislop]], [[Edward Johnson (tenor)|Edward Johnson]], [[Dinh Gilly]], [[Harold Williams (baritone)|Harold Williams]], [[Norman Allin]], [[Robert Radford]], [[Dora Labbette]], [[Walter Widdop]], [[Frank Mullings]], [[Herbert Heyner]] and [[Heddle Nash]], among others.&lt;ref name=divine/&gt; In 1924, Beecham joined the company at His Majesty's for ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 July 1924, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was short of money throughout its existence, and the resumption of international opera seasons at Covent Garden deprived the BNOC of its lucrative London seasons which had in the first years subsidised its provincial tours.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 July 1929, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased to exist in 1929 following a tax demand for £17,000 which forced it to go into voluntary liquidation.&lt;ref name=divine/&gt; Its last performances were ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]'' at the [[Golders Green Hippodrome]] in London, on 16 April 1929, in a season in which the conductors included Beecham, Barbirolli and [[Eugène Goossens, fils|Eugène Goossens]]. The company effectively re-formed as the [[Covent Garden English Opera Company]] in September 1929, with Barbirolli as its musical director, and continued under that name until 1938.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04014?q=%22first+broadcast%22+of+an+opera&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=14&amp;_start=1#firsthit "British National Opera Company"], ''New Grove Dictionary of Opera''.

== Financial impacts of colour choice ==
Silver is a popular colour for rental vehicles.&lt;ref name="peterson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/brn/070914/22589.html?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |title=Hottest Car Colors |author=Erin Peterson |publisher=Yahoo! Personal Finance |accessdate=2007-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417204221/http://biz.yahoo.com/brn/070914/22589.html?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |archivedate=2008-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars that are silver retain their value better than any other colour, reselling for around 10% more than white cars; this superior resale value has caused many UK police agencies to replace their standard white patrol cars with silver models.&lt;ref name="peterson"/&gt;

A common belief is that red cars cost more to [[car insurance|insure]]; in fact, insurers do not take colour into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/18/do-drivers-of-red-cars-really-pay-more-for-auto-insurance.html | author = Sarah Whitten | publisher = [[CNBC]] | accessdate = 2017-04-18 | title = Do drivers of red cars really pay more for auto insurance? | date = 2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/are-red-cars-more-expensive-to-insure/article551722/ | author = Roma Luciw | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate = 2017-04-18 | title = Are red cars more expensive to insure? | date = 2011-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical trends ==
[[File:DOWNTOWN PARKING LOT - NARA - 553303.jpg|thumb|More colour variety in 1973, America]]
Colour choice is subject to fluctuation and fashion, and historical trends shifted from dark neutral colours of early cars, through more vivid colours of 1950s and 1960s, back towards today's greyscale colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of Automobiles and Colour before the Age of Chromophobia |url=https://autouniversum.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/a-history-of-automobiles-and-color-before-the-age-of-chromophobia/ |website=www.autouniversum.wordpress.com |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Are Our Cars Painted Such Boring Colors? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/design/2011/10/car_paint_colors_why_are_so_many_cars_painted_white_silver_and_b.html |website=www.slate.com |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
A 2013 survey in the United States found that men were 12% more likely to prefer a red car, while women were 9% more likely to prefer silver.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/11/26/men-see-red-women-take-a-shine-to-silver-when-car-shopping-survey-says?.v=1&amp;.pf=family-home |title=Men See Red, Women Take A Shine To Silver When Car Shopping, Survey Says |author=Jim Gorzelany |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research suggested this may indicate that women are more likely to prefer practical cars, while men may be more likely to prefer fast and fun cars.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

The '''Celtiberian script''' is a [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic script]] that was the main [[writing system]] of the [[Celtiberian language]], an extinct [[Continental Celtic]] language, which was also occasionally written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. This script is a direct adaptation of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the most frequently used of the [[Iberian scripts]].

==Origins==
All the [[Paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the [[stop consonant]]s, and monophonemic values for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. They are thus to be classed as neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] was also involved.

==Tipology and variants==
The basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 [[sign (linguistics)|signs]] rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the [[northeastern Iberian script]], since the [[Celtiberians]] omitted one of the two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and one of the three [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 [[vowel]]s, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian ''s'' is transcribed as ''z'' in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (''d''), while the Iberian sign ''ś'' is transcribed as ''s''. As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''ḿ'', while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''m''. This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence{{which|date=March 2014}} of having allowed the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ''g'' and ''d'' to be differentiated from their respective [[voicelessness|voiceless]] counterparts, ''k'' and ''t'', by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (''p:b, t:d'' and ''k:g'').

==Location of findings==
The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the [[Ebro]] valley and near the sources of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] rivers, where [[ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], [[ceramic]] receptacles, [[bronze]] plaques and [[tessera]]s, [[amphora|amphores]], stones, [[spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorls]], etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third [[Botorrita]] bronze plaque ([[Zaragoza]]) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.

A '''chansonnier''' ({{lang-ca|cançoner}}, {{lang-oc|cançonièr}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|cancioneiro}}, {{lang-it|canzoniere}} or ''canzoniéro'', {{lang-es|cancionero}}) is a [[manuscript]] or printed book which contains a collection of [[chanson]]s, or [[polyphonic]] and [[Monophony|monophonic]] settings of songs, hence literally "[[songbook|song-books]]," although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the [[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]] and [[Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional]], which contain the bulk of [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]]). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the [[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in [[France]], but also in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and in the [[Iberian peninsula]].

'''''Chitrochor''''' (English title : Picture Imperfect) is a 1951 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] detective novella, written by [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]]. This story features the famous fictional Bengali [[private investigator]] [[Byomkesh Bakshi]], his assistant-cum-friend Ajit Bandyopadhyay and his wife Satyabati. This place takes place in a picturesque town in the border of north Bengal. This story has been adapted as a film, known as [[Abar Byomkesh]] in 2012, featuring [[Abir Chatterjee]] as Byomkesh Bakshi, and [[Saswata Chatterjee]] as Ajit Bandopadhay.

==Plot==
Byomkesh had fallen critically ill and is being nursed back to health by his wife, Satyabati, and dear friend, Ajit . On medical advice, Byomkesh goes to Dooars to recuperate with his two caring companions. He takes a decided turn for the better with the change in climate, much to the relief of Satyabati and Ajit.

But, as fate would have it, mystery arrives. At Dooars, Byomkesh meets Bengali inhabitants from the local community, including Dr. Ashwini Ghatak, Prof. Adinath Shome, Mahidhar Chaudhury, photographer Nakuleshwar, police officer Purander Pandey, deputy magistrate Umanath Ghosh  and banker Amaresh Raha. They have a get-together at the residence of Mahidhar Chaudhary, where everybody is regaled by the singing of Mahidhar's young daughter Rajani .

The flow of the party is somewhat interrupted by the sudden arrival of Falguni Pal, a poor artist, who has the rare talent of painting anyone's portrait after seeing his subject for only a few minutes. In passing, Mahidhar reports that a robbery had taken place at his house a couple of days back. The thief, however, had ignored all of Mahidhar's riches and stolen only a group photograph of Mahidhar with the other Bengali neighbours. Adding to the odd nature of the situation is that all the others who had a copy of that photograph seem to have misplaced or lost the same. The issue is apparently trivial, but, nonetheless, intrigues the ever-alert Byomkesh.

Matters take a more serious turn when there is yet another attempted robbery, this time, at the house of the deputy magistrate, Umanath Ghosh. Falguni Pal, the artist, is murdered in cold blood.

In yet another twist, Byomkesh finds out that both Adinath Shome and Ashwini Ghatak are romantically inclined towards the beautiful Rajani.

The strange disappearance of that one photograph leads Byomkesh to believe that someone is trying to remove all evidence of his presence in the locality. And after a series of hits and misses, Byomkesh finds out the killer to be the banker, Amaresh Jha. He was trying to flee with the bank's money and used a fake beard, while in the group photograph he was not wearing it. He stole those photographs and killed Falguni as he drew Amaresh's sketch when he was not in his beard. But, to escape jail, he commits suicide in the local station in the presence of Byomkesh and some others. This was most disgusting to Byomkesh as he wanted to catch hold of him alive.

'''''Clinton: The Musical''''' is a [[satiric]] [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by Paul Hodge, and a book by Paul Hodge and Michael Hodge and based on the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]]. After success in various festivals, the show played [[Off-Broadway]] in the spring of 2015.

==Background==
The musical is based on the premise that there are two sides to [[Bill Clinton]]: the mature and charismatic side ("WJ") and the fun and reckless side ("Billy").  Imagining  the two personalities as distinct characters, the musical follows the two Bill Clintons and [[Hillary Clinton]] through the major events of Bill Clinton's presidency.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

As the show begins, Hillary Rodham Clinton introduces herself and her husband, William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton. She reveals that Bill is actually two personalities, WJ and Billy, and that she is the only person who can see both of them. ("Overture"). With help from Hillary, WJ and Billy win the 1992 presidential election ("Awful-Awesome"). After arriving at the White House, WJ states his plans to be a serious and successful president, Hillary states her plan to be loved by the American people, and Billy states his plan to "get some tail" ("The Me I See"). In order to remain focused on his job, WJ starts ignoring Billy's fun-loving urges. Just a few days after being inaugurated, the media starts reporting on the Whitewater scandal, despite the fact that nobody who is reporting has any idea what the scandal actually is, and are just stretching the story out to gain viewers ("The Day After That"). Kenneth Starr is hired to investigate the scandal. Starr announces to the audience that he doesn't actually care about the American people or the Whitewater scandal, he's just in it for the fame ("A Starr is Born"). Hillary becomes increasingly worried that Billy will use his new office to cheat on her. As WJ reassures Hillary that he'll control Billy, Billy seduces White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office ("Lie to You"). In order to comfort Hillary, WJ tells her that she can write the country's new healthcare plan. Republican Newt Gingrich is infuriated by this, and he works with Ken Starr to rally other Republicans and take control of the Congress majority ("Say Nay"). During an encounter with Billy in the Oval Office, Monica Lewinsky exclaims that she can't believe she's having an affair with the president ("Monica's Song"). WJ finds out about this and confronts Billy, starting an argument between the two. Hillary finds out about their fight and explains to them that "the public likes it better when politicians work together" ("Both Ways"). After settling his differences with Billy, WJ confronts Newt Gingrich and convinces him to pass Hillary's healthcare bill. WJ and Billy are reelected in the presidential election of 1996, but Billy is the only one that takes the oath of office, which means Billy is able to start ignoring WJ as payback for the beginning of their first term ("Both Ways (Reprise)").

===Act 2===

As his second term begins, Billy celebrates in the Oval Office, while Linda Tripp secretly collects evidence of his affair with Monica ("What Could Go Wrong?"). Linda's evidence becomes public, but Billy attempts to convince the American people that the affair never happened ("That Woman, Miss Lewinsky"). Since he is officially the president, Billy must give the State of the Union address, a job WJ had previously done. Billy can't resist making sexual innuendos while writing his speech, so Hillary is forced to write the address and let Billy take all the credit ("State of the Union"). Having been abandoned by Billy and the American people, WJ reflects on all the things he was hoping to accomplish in his second term ("A Place Called Hope"). Monica, whom Billy has also abandoned, looks back on how confident he made her feel during their affair ("Monica's Song (Reprise)"). Hillary becomes increasingly angry at both WJ and Billy for the things they do behind her back. Though she still loves them, she decides she can't handle the stress anymore and tells the audience that she plans to divorce them ("Enough"). Meanwhile, Kenneth and Newt lead the movement to impeach and remove Billy from office ("Sexual Relations"). Hillary is visited by a vision of Elenor Roosevelt, who tries to convince her to stay with Billy and WJ, but Hillary misinterprets Eleanor and instead decides that she's going to run for president ("Brew It For Your Country"). Billy and WJ realize that their legacy will not be the work they did to advance universal healthcare, but instead, they will always be remembered for Billy's affair ("The Me I See / What Could Go Wrong? (Reprise)"). WJ and Billy forgive each other and apologize to Hillary. The three decide that the only way to ensure that Billy remains in office is to reveal to the world that William Jefferson Clinton is, in fact, two people. Newt is hesitant to forgive the Clintons but is forced to when WJ reveals Newt's affair with Calista Bisek. The senate votes to keep Billy in office and Hillary announces her 2008 candidacy for president ("Finale").

==Productions==

The '''coat of arms of the [[British Antarctic Territory]]''' was first granted in 1952, when the territory was still a [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|dependency]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] (along with [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]).

The arms consist of a shield bearing a flaming torch on a wavy background representing the sea. The dexter [[supporters|supporter]] is a golden lion, representing the [[United Kingdom]]. The sinister supporter is an [[Emperor penguin]], representing the native wildlife in the territory. The lion stands on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] of grass, while the penguin stands on a compartment of ice. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a representation of the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']], the research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]] on their first journey to the Antarctic.

The motto is “Research and Discovery”, reflecting the aims of the [[British Antarctic Survey]].

The coat of arms appears in the fly of the [[flag of the British Antarctic Territory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">The '''concours de façades de la ville de Paris''' was an architecture competition organized by the city of Paris at the very end of the 19th century.

== History ==
The contest was held annually between 1898 and the late 1930s, with an interruption during World War I. It recognized several buildings completed during the year.

The contest was set up after the creation of the rue Reaumur made in 1897. The city of Paris took inspiration from {{Interlanguage link multi|Concours d'architecture de la Ville de Bruxelles (1872-1876)|fr|3=Concours d'architecture de la Ville de Bruxelles (1872-1876)|lt=a similar contest held in Brussels}}&lt;ref name="Figaro"/&gt; in the 1890s to promote the erection of original buildings on this street; initially restricted to the sole rue Réaumur, the contest was finally extended to the whole of Paris.

{{History of Western art music}}

'''Contemporary classical music''' can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categorization ==
Generally {{According to whom|date=September 2017}} "contemporary classical music" amounts to:

* The modern forms of [[art music]]
** The post-1945 [[Modernism (music)|modern forms]] of post-tonal music after the death of [[Anton Webern]]&lt;ref&gt;Du Noyer, Paul (ed.) (2003), "Contemporary" in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music''. Flame Tree. p 272. {{ISBN|1-904041-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;(including [[serial music]], [[electroacoustic music]], [[musique concrète]], [[experimental music]], [[atonal music]], [[minimalist music]], etc.)
** The post-1975 forms of this music&lt;ref&gt;Leon Botstein: "Modernism" ¶9 ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed 28 April 2007), &lt;http://www.grovemusic.com&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;(including [[post-modern music]], [[Spectral music]], [[post-minimalism]], [[sound art]], etc.)

== History ==
=== Background ===
{{Main|20th century classical music}}

At the beginning of the twentieth century, composers of classical music were experimenting with an increasingly [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pitch language, which sometimes yielded [[atonality|atonal]] pieces. Following World War I, as a backlash against what they saw as the increasingly exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism, certain composers adopted a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassic]] style, which sought to recapture the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles&lt;ref&gt;Whittall "[http://www.grovemusic.com Neo-Classicism]" (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[New Objectivity]] and [[Social Realism]]). After World War II, modernist composers sought to achieve greater levels of control in their composition process (e.g., through the use of the [[twelve tone technique]] and later total [[serialism]]). At the same time, conversely, composers also experimented with means of abdicating control, exploring indeterminacy or aleatoric processes in smaller or larger degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz and Godfrey 1993, chapter 7: "Order and Chaos", pp. 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advances led to the birth of electronic music.&lt;ref&gt;Manning 2004, 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation with tape loops and repetitive textures contributed to the advent of [[minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz and Godfrey 1993, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other composers started exploring the theatrical potential of the musical performance ([[performance art]], [[mixed media]], [[fluxus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz and Godfrey 1993, 289ff.&lt;/ref&gt;New works of Contemporary classical music continue to be created. Each year, the [[Boston Conservatory at Berklee]] presents 700 performances. New works from Contemporary classical music program students comprise roughly 150 of these performances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Music in Contemporary Classical Music Performance |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |url=https://bostonconservatory.berklee.edu/contemporary-music/mm-contemporary-classical-music-performance }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 1945–75 ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
To some extent, European and the US traditions diverged after World War II. Among the most influential composers in Europe were [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. The first and last were both pupils of [[Olivier Messiaen]]. An important aesthetic philosophy as well as a group of compositional techniques at this time was [[serialism]] (also called "through-ordered music", "'total' music" or "total tone ordering"), which took as its starting point the compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern]] (but was opposed to traditional [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]]), and was also closely related to [[Le Corbusier]]'s idea of the ''[[modulor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bandur 2001, 5, 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some more traditionally based composers such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Benjamin Britten]] maintained a tonal style of composition despite the prominent serialist movement.

In America, composers like [[Milton Babbitt]], [[John Cage]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[Henry Cowell]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[George Rochberg]], and [[Roger Sessions]], formed their own ideas. Some of these composers (Cage, Cowell, Glass, Reich) represented a new methodology of [[experimental music]], which began to question fundamental notions of music such as [[musical notation|notation]], [[performance]], duration, and repetition, while others (Babbitt, Rochberg, Sessions) fashioned their own extensions of the twelve-tone serialism of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]].

== Movements ==
=== Modernism ===
{{Main|Modernism (music)}}
Many of the key figures of the [[High modernism#Visual arts and music|high modern movement]] are alive, or only recently deceased, and there is also still an extremely active core of composers, performers, and listeners who continue to advance the ideas and forms of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Botstein 2001, §8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--If anything, Botstein's article refutes this claim, and never once mentions "high modernism".--&gt;

[[Serialism]] is one of the most important post-war movements among the high modernist schools. Serialism, more specifically named "integral" or "compound" serialism, was led by composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in Europe, and by [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Donald Martino]], [[Mario Davidovsky]], and [[Charles Wuorinen]] in the United States. Some of their compositions use an ordered set or several such sets, which may be the basis for the whole composition, while others use "unordered" sets. The term is also often used for [[dodecaphony]], or [[twelve-tone technique]], which is alternatively regarded as the model for integral serialism.

Modernist composers active during this period include Scottish composer [[James MacMillan (composer)|James MacMillan]] (who draws on sources as diverse as [[plainchant]], South American '[[liberation theology]]', [[Scottish folk music|Scottish folksongs]], and Polish avant-garde techniques of the 1960s),&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish composers [[Erkki Salmenhaara]], [[Henrik Otto Donner]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1992, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Magnus Lindberg]],&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;Schwartz 1994, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian composer [[Franco Donatoni]], and English composer [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]].&lt;ref name="schwartz"/&gt;

Between 1975 and 1990, a shift in the paradigm of [[computer]] technology had taken place, making electronic music systems affordable and widely accessible. The personal computer had become an essential component of the electronic musician’s equipment, superseding [[Analog synthesizer|analog]] [[synthesizer]]s and fulfilling the traditional functions of composition and scoring, synthesis and sound processing, sampling of audio input, and control over external equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors equate polystylism with [[eclecticism]], while others make a sharp distinction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', entry "Polystylistic", quoting Christian &amp; Cornwall's ''Guide to Russian Literature'' (1998): "Zhdanov is eclectic; he mixes high poetic, archaic, scientific and everyday realities without imposing any hierarchy. His manner may be called ‘polystylistic’", and entry "Polystylist", quoting ''Musical America'', November 1983: "An eclectic only ''passively'' collects material from different sources, but a polystylist puts together what he collects, consciously, in a new way."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historicism ====
{{Main|Musical historicism}}
[[Musical historicism]]—the use of historical materials, structures, styles, techniques, media, conceptual content, etc., whether by a single composer or those associated with a particular school, movement, or period—is evident to varying degrees in minimalism, post-minimalism, world-music, and other genres in which tonal traditions have been sustained or have undergone a significant revival in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 440-42, 446-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some post-minimalist works employ medieval and other genres associated with early music, such as the "Oi me lasso" and other [[laude]] of [[Gavin Bryars]].

The historicist movement is closely related to the emergence of musicology and the [[early music revival]]. A number of historicist composers have been influenced by their intimate familiarity with the instrumental practices of earlier periods ([[Hendrik Bouman]], [[Grant Colburn]], [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]], [[Paulo Galvão]], [[Roman Turovsky-Savchuk]]). The musical historicism movement has also been stimulated by the formation of such international organizations as the [[Delian Society]] and [[Vox Saeculorum]].&lt;ref&gt;Colburn 36-45, 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoromanticism ====
{{Main|Neoromanticism (music)}}
The vocabulary of extended tonality, which flourished in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, continues to be used throughout the contemporary period.  It never has been considered shocking or controversial in the larger musical world—as has been demonstrated statistically for the United States, at least, where "most composers continued working in what has remained throughout this century the mainstream of tonal-oriented composition"&lt;ref&gt;Straus 1999, 303, 307–308, 310–11, 314–29).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Art rock influence ====
Some composers have emerged since the 1980s who are influenced by [[art rock]], for example, [[Rhys Chatham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhyschatham.net/nintiesRCwebsite/Essay_1970-90.html Chatham 1994].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Simplicity ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
{{Main|New Simplicity}}
A movement in Denmark (''Den Nye Enkelhed'') in the late nineteen-sixties and another in Germany in the late seventies and early eighties, the former attempting to create more objective, impersonal music, and the latter reacting with a variety of strategies to restore the subjective to composing, both sought to create music using simple textures. The German New Simplicity's best-known composer is [[Wolfgang Rihm]], who strives for the emotional volatility of late 19th-century [[Romanticism]] and early 20th-century [[Expressionism]]. Called ''Die neue Einfachheit'' in German, it has also been termed "New Romanticism", "New Subjectivity", "New Inwardness", "New Sensuality", "New Expressivity", and "New Tonality".

Styles found in other countries sometimes associated with the German New Simplicity movement include the so-called "Holy Minimalism" of the Pole [[Henryk Górecki]] and the Estonian [[Arvo Pärt]], (in their works after 1970), as well as Englishman [[John Tavener]], who unlike the New Simplicity composers have turned back to Medieval and Renaissance models, however, rather than to 19th-century romanticism for inspiration. Important representative works include [[Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)|Symphony No. 3 "Symphony of Sorrowful Songs"]] (1976) by Górecki, ''[[Cantus In Memoriam Benjamin Britten|Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten]]'' (1977) by Pärt, ''The Veil of the Temple'' (2002) by Tavener, and "Silent Songs" (1974–1977) by [[Valentin Silvestrov]].

=== New Complexity ===
{{Main|New Complexity}}
New Complexity is a current within today's European contemporary avant-garde music scene, named in reaction to the New Simplicity.  Amongst the candidates suggested for having coined the term are the composer [[Nigel Osborne]], the Belgian musicologist [[Harry Halbreich]], and the British/Australian musicologist Richard Toop, who gave currency to the concept of a movement with his article "Four Facets of the New Complexity".&lt;ref&gt;Toop 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though often [[atonal]], highly abstract, and [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] in sound, the "New Complexity" is most readily characterized by the use of techniques which require complex [[musical notation]]. This includes [[extended technique]]s, [[microtonality]], odd [[Musical tuning|tunings]], highly disjunct [[Melodic motion|melodic contour]], innovative [[timbre]]s, complex [[polyrhythms]], unconventional [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentations]], abrupt changes in loudness and intensity, and so on.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The diverse group of composers writing in this style includes [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Brian Ferneyhough]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], [[James Dillon (composer)|James Dillon]], [[Michael Finnissy]], [[James Erber]], and [[Roger Redgate]].

[[File:DabousGiraffe2.jpg|thumb|Smaller petroglyphs near the Dabous Giraffes]]
The '''Dabous Giraffes''' are a [[neolithic]] [[petroglyph]] by an unknown artist. Completed between 9000 BC and 5000 BC, the giraffe carvings were first documented by David Coulson in 1997 while on a photographic expedition at a site in [[Niger]], [[Africa]].

The carving is 20 feet in height and consists of two giraffes carved into the ''Dabous Rock'' with a great amount of detail. Dabous Rock is located on the sloping slope of a small rocky outcropping of sandstone in the first foothills of the Air Mountains. One of the giraffes is male, while the other, smaller, is female.

In the surroundings 828 images have been found engraved on the rocks, of which 704 are animals (bovidae, giraffes, ostriches, antelopes, lions, rincerontes and camels), 61 are human and 159 are indeterminate.

The Bradshaw Foundation is an organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of this petroglyph.

==History==
[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|300px|thumb|left| Illyrian [[Coin]] found at Daorson, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]
Daorson was built around a central fort or [[acropolis]], surrounded by [[Cyclopean masonry|cyclopean walls]] made of huge&lt;ref&gt;Urbano biće Bosne i Hercegovine - page 27 by Seka Brkljača - 1996, "Its name was Daorson. It belonged to the illyrian sphere. Its 46 meters of the old fortress are preserved."&lt;/ref&gt; stone blocks (similar to those in [[Mycenae]], in [[Greece]]). The acropolis would have housed all of the important administrative, public and religious buildings. The defensive wall extending from southwest to northeast was 65 metres long, 4.2 metres wide, and from 4.5 to 7.5 metres high with doors and towers on both sides. The Daorsi used the [[Greek language]] and alphabet and kept trading relations with the Greeks.

The remnants of numerous wine amphorae have been found, including some ceramic fragments. The most valuable of the finds is a bronze helmet decorated with a series of Greek mythological figures, including [[Aphrodite]], [[Nike (mythology)|Nika]], [[Heli (mythology)|Heli]], [[Dionysus|Dionysius]], [[Muse]], [[Pegasus]]. The inscription on it is similar to the inscription on a helmet found in [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]]. The remnants of a granite sculpture of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] have also been found. This piece includes an Illyrian relief with thirteen snakes and five pairs of eagle’s wings. A small building housed a [[mint (coin)|mint]] facility.  Thirty-nine different coins were discovered in this building, the majority (29) depicted King [[Ballaios]], who ruled after 168 BC.  Nine of the recovered coins had a Greek inscription with an image of a boat. Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, allowing the tribe to remain independent while securing their business, cultural and trade links with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177] Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 177, "Two other coinages of Illyrian peoples are dated to the period following 168 BC. Those with the legend DAORSON with a galley on the reverse were produced by the Daorsi."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Daorsi were attacked by the [[Delmatae]],&lt;ref&gt;I greci in Adriatico, Volume 2 by Lorenzo Braccesi, Mario Luni, page 152, "The Daorsi suffered directly from the attacks of the Delmatae and were understandably one of the first peoples who had left Genthius half brother Caravantius and sought protection from the Roman state placing their armed forces at the disposal of the Romans. After the war they were rewarded by having been given immunity..."&lt;/ref&gt; they joined [[Vis (island)|Issa]]&lt;ref&gt;The magistrates of the Roman Republic - by Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton - 1960 - page 446, "Head of a commission sent, after the receipt of complaints from Issa and the Daorsi, to observe conditions in Illyria and Dalmatia."&lt;/ref&gt; in seeking the protection of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] state.  The Daorsi abandoned [[Caravantius]] and fought on the side of the Romans, contributing with their strong navy.  After the [[Illyrian Wars]] the Romans gave the Daorsi immunity.

==Site description==
[[File:Daorson, Bosnia and Herzegovina.jpg|thumb|Remains of the outer walls of Daorson, as seen in 2013.]]
Ošanjići consist of three linked stones groups, the disposition of which is dictated by the lie of the land.

The central area is occupied by a dominant hill fort or acropolis below and to the south and south-west of which are terraces on the ridge, while to the east, on the Banje plateau, is the outer-acropolis area of residential and commercial, mainly artisanal and trade quarters of the settlement.

The hill fort was built on a prehistoric fortified settlement which had been in existence there since the early (17/16th century BCE) to the end of the late [[Bronze Age]] (9/8th century BCE). The date of the ransacking of the town of Daorson that finally put an end to human settlement there can be determined with fair accuracy as the mid or second half of the 1st century BCE from the details of the wars waged by the Roman Praetor [[Vatinius]] against the Delmati. No permanent settlement ever arose on the ruins of the town of Daors. There is ample evidence of its advanced culture and civilization: it minted its own coins and produced complex artistically decorated buckles, there is [[graffiti]] on shards of pottery vessels, and parts of stone statues of human figures some 2 m in height were found.

A megalithic wall, erected following the lie of the land, has been dated to the 4th century BCE, when both towers were probably built following the construction of the wall.  The rest of the acropolis is of later date, through to the 1st century BCE. 
One of the most important finds is a helmet with the Greek inscription ΠΙИ, probably the abbreviated Illyrian name of the owner PINNES; it was probably made in the 3rd century BCE.[10]

''' Design history ''' is the study of objects of design in their historical and stylistic contexts.

With a broad definition, the contexts of design history include the social, the cultural, the economic, the political, the technical and the aesthetic. Design history has as its objects of study all designed objects including those of [[architecture]], [[fashion]], [[crafts]], [[interiors]], [[textiles]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]].

Design history has had to incorporate criticism of the 'heroic' structure of its discipline, in response to the establishment of [[material culture]], much as [[art history]] has had to respond to [[visual culture]], (although visual culture has been able to broaden the subject area of art history through the incorporation of the televisual, film and new media). Design history has done this by shifting its focus towards the acts of production and consumption.

== Design history as a component of British practice-based courses ==

Design history also exists as a component of many practice-based courses.

The teaching and study of design history within art and design programs in Britain are one of the results of the National Advisory Council on Art Education in the 1960s. Among its aims was making art and design education a legitimate academic activity, to which ends a historical perspective was introduced. This necessitated the employment or ‘buying in’ of specialists from art history disciplines, leading to a particular style of delivery: “Art historians taught in the only way that art historians knew how to teach;  they switched off the lights, turned on the slide projector, showed slides of art and design objects, discussed and evaluated them and asked (art and design) students to write essays – according to the scholarly conventions of academia”.&lt;ref&gt;Raein, M. (2005). "Integration of studio and theory in the teaching of graphic design." Art, Design &amp; Communication in Higher Education 3(3): 163–174&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious effect of the traditional approach design history as sequential, in which X begat Y and Y begat Z. This has pedagogical implications in that the realization that assessment requires a fact-based regurgitation of received knowledge leads students to ignore discussions of the situations surrounding a design’s creation and reception and to focus instead on simple facts such as who designed what and when.

This 'heroic/aesthetic' view – the idea that there are a few great designers who should be studied and revered unquestioningly – arguably instills an unrealistic view of the design profession. Although the design industry has been complicit in promoting the heroic view of history, the establishment of the UK government of [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] has led to calls for design courses to be made less 'academic' and more attuned to the 'needs' of the industry. Design history, as a component of design courses, is under increasing threat in the UK at least and it has been argued that its survival depends on an increased focus on the study of the processes and effects of design rather than the lives of designers themselves.

Ultimately it appears that design history for practice-based courses is rapidly becoming a branch of social and cultural studies, leaving behind its art historical roots. This has led to a great deal of debate as the two approaches forge distinct pedagogical approaches and philosophies.

=== Debates over the merits of different approaches to teaching design history on practice-based courses ===

The debate over the best way to approach the teaching of design history to practice-based students is often heated, but it is notable that the biggest push to adopt a 'realistic' approach (i.e. non-hero-based, analysing the production and consumption of design that would otherwise be viewed as ephemeral) comes from teachers delivering these programmes, while critics are predominantly those who teach 'pure' design history courses.

The biggest criticism of the 'realistic' approach appears to be that it imposes anonymity on designers, while the counter argument is that the vast majority of designers ''are'' anonymous and that it is the uses and users of design that are more important.

The research literature suggests that, contrary to critics' predictions of the death of design history, this realistic approach is beneficial. Baldwin and McLean at the University of Brighton (now at the University of Dundee and Edinburgh College of Art respectively) reported attendance figures for courses using this model rising dramatically,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, J and McLean, S "Abandoning History: delivering historical and critical studies to practice-based students" at the New Views conference, LCC 29 October 2005. [http://www.jonathanbaldwin.co.uk/assets/AbandoningHistory.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and improved interest in the subject, as did Rain at Central St. Martin's. This compares with the often-reported low attendance and low grades of practice-based students facing the 'death by slideshow' model.

Robbins was director of the Foothill College Writers' Conference 2003, 2006–2008.

==Education==
Union Institute, BA, 1990. The University of Iowa, MFA, 1993. Two years post-graduate studies in literature, [[multiculturalism]], and criticism at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], 1994–96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html dorenrobbins.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145615/http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early influences, development of poetry==
Doren Robbins began actively publishing [[poetry]] in the 1970s. In 1969, while reading [[Henry Miller]]'s ''The Time of the Assassins'', his study of [[Arthur Rimbaud]], Robbins became aware of [[Kenneth Rexroth]]'s poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable "Memorial" for [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 poetryfoundation.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010024456/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thou Shalt Not Kill," about which Miller stated, "If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this "'Memorial.'" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with ''The Diary of Najinsky'', [[Van Gogh]]'s ''Letters'', [[Kenneth Patchen]]'s ''The Journal of Albion Moonlight'', [[Jack Hirschman]]'s ''Artaud Anthology'', and [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s ''The Murder of Christ'', making the connection to Rexroth's [[elegy]] for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted [[Social alienation|alienation]] of society with the [[vulnerability]] and ensuing [[martyrdom]] of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue "My Dylan Thomas," the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' ''Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By [[John Malcolm Brinnin]] and Leftover Life To Kill By [[Caitlin Thomas]]''. The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in general.
After a five-year period of studying many of the key books of [[Western literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]], Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become—through his essays in ''Bird in the Bush'', ''Classics Revisited'', and ''Assays''; along with his ''Collected Shorter Poems'', ''Collected Longer Poems'', and his many books of translations—his initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]]. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solt&lt;ref&gt;[http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc highmoonoon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230015338/http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc |date=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker.

==Political sensibility==
Clearly, as explored in his essay ''The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community'',&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his prose poem, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', Perivale Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  honoring the [[anarchist]] organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation.  It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as ''For [[Pablo Neruda]],'' ''Hooker with a Lily'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Roots and the Towers'', Third Rail Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''They're Honking at a Woman'', ''The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream'', ''Collecting Myself'',&lt;ref&gt;''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;/ref&gt;  or the later poems ''My Pico Boulevard'', ''Gregor Samsa's Face'', ''Her Friday'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Driving Face Down'', Eastern Washington University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his more recent poems ''Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood'', ''Latina Worker'', ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', and ''Before and After Tampico''&lt;ref&gt;From ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', Eastern Washington University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetry.la/page188.html poetry.la]&lt;/ref&gt; display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter "Alienated Labor" from the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts'', but the underlying thematics in Robbins' [[political poetry|political poems]] are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the''...Rabelais...Whitman'' essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people—aside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace—shows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, as in his ''Neruda'' poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against—de Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that ''we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are—their work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane''.&lt;ref&gt;Third Rail #4, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem "Sympathetic Manifesto" with these final lines: "I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance" (60).  And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that "To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture—is the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans."&lt;ref&gt;Notes to ''The Three Penny Opera'', Grove, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there does not appear to be a consistent "reductive" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that "Complex seeing must be practiced."  Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are "Predators' Hour2, Open All Night"&lt;ref&gt;''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (63-66).&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Ash Lands." Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com.  Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Art supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other than our own resilient skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Baroque Magazine'' Vol. 26 No. 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: "Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty.  But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing."&lt;ref&gt;See "Biography," Dorenrobbins.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural work==
Influenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as [[George Hitchcock (poet)|George Hitchcock]]'s ''Kayak'', [[Clayton Eshleman]]'s ''Caterpillar'', and [[Robert Bly]]'s ''The Seventies'' with its emphases on "wild association", political poetry, and critical [[book review]]s, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, ''Third Rail'' (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982.
The avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'', [[William Carlos Williams]]'s ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'', [[Louis Zukofsky]]'s ''"A"'', and [[Charles Olsen]]'s ''The Maximus Poems''. The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'', the French "cubist" poetry of [[Pierre Reverdy]], and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets [[George Oppen]], the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and the [[Beat Generation]] poet [[Philip Whalen]]. On the other hand, [[Beat poet]]s [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Harold Norse]], and [[Charles Bukowski]] carried on the [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] tradition of the authentic voice, "I was the man, I suffered, I was there." Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'' combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's ''Kayak'' and Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'', Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to [[surrealism]], but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of "automatic writing" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of [[language poets]]. To this end Bly emphasized the works of [[Georg Trakl]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[César Vallejo]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive [[depth psychology]] fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and [[bathos]]; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated.
For Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of ''Third Rail'' was basically connected to the paths ''Kayak'', ''Caterpillar'', and ''The Seventies'' were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as "the international idiom". From 1975–1982, ''Third Rail'' published works by [[Henry Miller]], [[Walter Lowenfels]], [[Kenneth Rexroth]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Jack Micheline]], [[Christopher Buckley (poet)|Christopher Buckley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/buckley/index.html creativewriting.ucr.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Blazek]], [[Andrea Hollander Budy]], [[Naomi Shihab Nye]], Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, [[Paul Eluard]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], [[Natalia Gorbanevskaia]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as "Poets on [[Chile]], Neruda, [[Isabel Allende|Allende]]" (1976) and "Poets Against Nuclear Power" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of ''Kayak Press'', George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker.

In 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, ''Electric Rexroth''.  His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, [[Gerald Stern]], Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, [[Ingrid Wendt]], Clayton Eshlemen, [[Marvin Bell]], and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for ''Electric Rexroth'' were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative [[lyrical poetry]]: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness  pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of cliché. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, "Someone waiting for me among the violins," Philip Levine's, "The Simple Truth," Tania Pryputneiwicz's "Labor," and Gerald Stern's "Ducks Are for Our Happiness," are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for ''Electric Rexroth'', Robert Bly's "An Open Rose," and "Grandma's Myth" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'' (Cedar Hill Press).

==Themes==
Ethnic and working-class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter.  Whether they be family members that escaped [[pogrom]]s in [[Ukraine]], deserted the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], survived [[World War I|WWI]], [[World War II|WWII]], the [[Korean War|American-Korean War]], or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the [[Vietnam War|American-Vietnam War]] or the violent conflicts in [[Latin America]], many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence.  The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of [[persecution]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems "Before and After Tampico", "Four Family", and "My Pico Boulevard". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and [[manifesto]], "Poetry is in the Streets" ("Le Poesy es en la rue"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and [[censorship]] underlying and undermining the subject.  These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of [[injustice]] and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament.  One of his more noted poems, "For Neruda",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Roots'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, [[dissidence]], and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to [[Joseph Stalin]].

Robbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, [[carpenter]]s and war [[veteran]]s making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a [[concentration camp]] working the [[delicatessen]] counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]s and [[department store]]s.  His poems "Anna", and "Dvayda", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Wife of Bath]]'' with her exceptional forthrightness or [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Emilia (Othello)|Emilia]] with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of [[B. Traven]]'s ''[[The Death Ship]]'' can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, "Before and After Tampico."

For Robbins, the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] of "Poetry is in the Streets" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]]s that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression.  Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]],&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Sympathetic'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, "Name a Dish After Me",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Donkey's'' 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure.

Robbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books ''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', (Van Nuys: Perivale Press, 1987) 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''Seduction of the Groom''.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Seduction of the Groom: Love Poems'' (Palos Verdes, Loom Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are "In-terminal Rose", "Seduction of the Groom", "Dreaming of a Daughter", and "In the Middle of a Fight". Examples from his more recent collections ''Double Muse&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Double Muse'' (Rabbel-A Press 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;'',  ''The Donkey's Tale''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren. ''The Donkey's Tale'' (Los Angeles, Red Wind Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Driving Face Down'',&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Driving Face Down'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and "My Piece of the Puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  include "You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I", "Marc Chagall and the Male Soul", "I Went Through a Box of Emily's [[Shell Jewelry]]", "The Eighties"; and from current published poems: "Pulled Over", "The Fire Petal", "The Weaving", "The Sexiest Part", "My Boat, My Waves", and "Badlands and Outlands".

While the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, "Badlands and Outlands" (''Double Muse'' 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, "Badlands and Outlands" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment.  The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self-destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces "not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops […]" And yet, there is "…the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is "crested, empathic, vulgar." The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: "momentary undermined attentions, in Florence—/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence."

==Style, form, and themes==
Many poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem.  In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, "I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[…]" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Doren Robbins, [untitled statement of prose poetry], ''Bear Flag Republic: Prose Poems and Poetics from California'', ed. Christopher Buckley and Gary Young (Santa Cruz: Greenhouse Review Press/ Alcatraz Editions, 2008) 327-28.&lt;/ref&gt;   Arguably, the collage technique of [[monologue]], short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and [[vaudeville]]-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in ''House of Fame'', Bottom's dream from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', as well Shakespeare's other "clowns" in ''[[Othello]]'' and particularly the "philosophizing" clown in ''[[King Lear]]''.

Robbins' first prose collection, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'', certainly displays an affinity with [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne's]] enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. His prose poem essay in ''Bear Flag Republic'' notes with appreciation the writings of [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]], Henry Miller, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Marguerite Young]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] Jr., [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Stephen Dixon (author)|Stephen Dixon]], and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted ''Journal of Albion Moonlight''.  Such works as "Chaucer's Quill, [[Sappho]]'s Libido, [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Eye Brows", "Dealing With the Insomnia Surf", "Pantagruel Antigruel", "As Much Sex as Elvis", "Green Torso", and "Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation", from ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'' appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry.  Whether these "omissions" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output.  Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'', such as "Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/fiction.htm 25. Robbins, Café Irreal, #29]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Nothing but an Ear",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpse.org/ See ''Exquisite Corpse'', #14 &amp; #16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir",&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hotel Amerika'', Vol.7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; from the forthcoming novella, ''Twin Extra'' (Highmoonoon 2010); and "Just My Luck", "My Defects Call Me Back", and "Night Song" from the ''Bear Flag Republic'' prose poem anthology.

The '''Eagle Gate monument''' is a historical monument—more in the form of an arch than a gate—seventy-six feet across, situated at the intersection of State Street at South Temple, adjacent to [[Temple Square]], in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Desert States |first= Michael Schelling |last= Durham |authorlink= |year= 1990 |publisher= [[Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang]] |location= |isbn= 1-55670-109-8 |oclc= |page= 365 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ95AAAAMAAJ |accessdate= 2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Eagle Gate was remodeled and enlarged with new stone piers and wider inverted arches in the early 1890s (with Ralph Ramsay's eagle rebuilt and fortified); designed by [[Don Carlos Young]], an architect son of Brigham Young.  Due to the widening of State Street in the early 1960s, the prior monument including Ramsay's eagle was removed and replaced with a much wider and larger third generation Eagle Gate, designed by Salt Lake City architect George Cannon Young.  Young was the son of Don Carlos Young and the grandson of Brigham Young. The monument is one of Salt Lake City's most well known pioneer landmarks, and its current design is one of Salt Lake City's best standing examples of [[Mid-Century Modern]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Deseret News, Friday, Nov. 24, 2006, "Eagle Gate spans the history of Salt Lake."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">'''Easterhouse''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[indie rock]] group from the mid to late 1980s, known for jangly guitars and [[leftist]] political leaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Semyan |url=http://www.icrates.org/underground-resistance-mccarthy-easterhouse-and-the-enemy-within/ |title=Underground Resistance: McCarthy, Easterhouse and The Enemy Within |publisher=iCrates |date= |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Named after the [[Easterhouse]] area of [[Glasgow]], the band was formed in [[Stretford]], near Manchester by brothers Andy and Ivor Perry, Peter Vanden, Gary Rostock and Michael Murray in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="dash"&gt;[http://www.music-dash.co.uk/news/yesterday.asp Tomorrow/Yesterday] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212211254/http://www.music-dash.co.uk/news/yesterday.asp |date=12 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Perry, intrigued by [[communism]] and inspired by [[Bob Marley]]'s direct delivery of political content, was invited to join the band in order to improve its lyrical content. Perry's political stance reflected the perspectives of the then active [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|Revolutionary Communist Party]], with particular regard to Irish politics. &lt;ref name="dash" /&gt; Easterhouse played their first gig on 30 August 1983 at [[Dingwalls]] in [[London]] as the support band for [[The Smiths]] after Ivor Perry convinced [[Morrissey]] to let them have the opening spot.&lt;ref name="dash" /&gt; Their [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] singles "Whistling In The Dark" and "Inspiration" were both Top 5 [[UK Indie Chart|independent chart]] hits. Their energetic first album, ''Contenders'', featuring their signature song, "1969", has been compared to [[The Chameleons]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]], and The Smiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,80139,00.html Easterhouse : Contenders - Listen, Review and Buy at ARTISTdirect] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192657/http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,80139,00.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardslair.co.uk/easterhouse.htm Easterhouse - Contenders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170101/http://www.leonardslair.co.uk/easterhouse.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1986, Easterhouse participated in the [[Festival of the Tenth Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/fac151h.html Fac 151 The Festival of the Tenth Summer &gt; The Ten Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172419/http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/fac151h.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Contenders'', Ivor left the band; by the time second album ''Waiting for the Redbird'' was released in 1989, Andy Perry was the sole remaining member of the original line-up. It produced a minor hit, "Come Out Fighting", which had significant airplay in the US, and spawned a Justin Strauss remix version of the same song.
 
In 2005 the band reunited for a one off gig, featuring [[Andy Rourke]] (ex-bassist, [[The Smiths]]) {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Post-band activities==
Ivor Perry formed The Cradle with Rostock and [[Craig Gannon]] a musical contributor to The Smiths.&lt;ref name="dash" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherryred.co.uk/books/indiehits/c.htm Indie Hits "C"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308003310/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/books/indiehits/c.htm |date=8 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp3.com/easterhouse/artists/3522/biography.html Easterhouse MP3 Downloads - Easterhouse Music Downloads - Easterhouse Music Videos - Easterhouse Pictures - MP3.com]{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had a number 12 indie chart hit with "It's Too High" in 1987, but the band was put on hold when [[Johnny Marr]] left The Smiths.

==Introduction==
The realism is derived from real word. This school emerged in the nineteenth century. The realism is based on realism and the subject was made in contemporary society. The emergence factors of This school include :

1. The not-so-famous writers and artists who lived in the Latin Quarter of Paris and made a mock of romantics.

2. [[Barbizon]] School painters of the [[Italy|Italian]] classical tradition that was common at that time, Considered obsolete. And called for direct observation of nature. And reacted against the romantices reality escape.

==The realism elementary==

This type of realism begins with the works of [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]. Elementary realism is committed itself to renewal accurate, complete and honestly social environment and the contemporary world, But this renewal is very simple and a pattern is not offered. In addition, Elementary realism is pessimistic and disappointed about the future. Works that were written in this school include, [[War and Peace]] by [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s [[Crime and Punishment]] and [[The Brothers Karamazov]] . [[Cape|Cape short story]] written by [[Nikolai Gogol]] as a fine example for elementary realism.

The '''flag and coat of arms of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta''' display a white [[cross]] on a red field (blazon ''gules a cross argent''),  ultimately derived from the design worn by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the [[Crusades]].

The [[State flag|State Flag]] represents the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] as a sovereign institution, and it bears a [[Latin cross]] that extends to the edges of the flag. The Flag of the Order's Works represents its humanitarian and medical activities, and it bears a white [[Maltese cross]] on a red field.
Both flags together represent the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Its constitution states: "The flag of the Order bears either the white latin cross on a red field or the white eight-pointed cross (cross of Malta) on a red field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
{{see|Maltese cross}}
[[File:SiegeOfRhodes1480.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners of the order at the [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)]], shown as ''gules a cross argent'', and as ''counter-quarterly gules a cross argent and or a cross ancrée gules'' (c. 1483).]]
The banner of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] was introduced in 1130, on the order of [[Pope Innocent III]], for disambiguation from the [[Templars]] who used the reversed colours. The "eight-pointed cross" is also said to originate in the 12th century, under [[Raymond du Puy]] (this was at first a ''cross fourchée'' or ''cross ancrée'', and developed into the fully articulated [[Maltese cross]] only around or after 1500).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berthod, ''Grandes figures de l'Ordre de Malte'', Artège Editions (2010) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=G1TQDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]] in 1259 made the white cross the design to be put on the [[mantling]] of the knights.  After that, the emblem was adopted as a general symbol for the Order.  
In the time after the Hospitallers moved to [[Cyprus]] in 1291, the banner of a white cross in a red field was flown from ships in their navy.

The Flag of the Order's Works, featuring a Maltese cross, is flown by the SMOM's Grand Priories, Subpriories, and National Associations.  
As a symbol of its humanitarian works, the Order flies it at its hospitals and medical facilities.   It is sometimes described as the "Grand Master's flag," but it is not used as a [[royal standard|personal standard]].

The Grand Master's personal flag is red with a white Maltese cross surrounded by the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the order and surmounted by a crown.  It flies over the SMOM's magistral seats when the Grand Master is present.

'''Gatbawi (or Gwanbong Seokjoyeoraejwasang)''' is a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] statue in [[Daehan-ri]], [[Wachon-myeon]], [[Gyeongsan]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], the [[Republic of Korea]]. It was made in the [[Unified Silla]] Kingdom era and is well known with the name of Gatbawi Buddha (Stone Hat Buddha). It sits {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall, and the hat is a {{convert|15|cm|in|0|adj=on}} thick flat stone on his head,

This single granite sculpture was made up by [[Uihyeon]], at the top of the {{convert|850|m|ft|adj=on}} high rough [[Palgongsan]] and is surrounded by a screen-like rock wall as its background. It is said that Uihyeon made it in order to appease his mother's soul in the 7th ruling year of [[Queen Seondeok]] of [[Silla]] Kingdom.

==Legend==

The legend of Daegu Gatbawi says that a big crane flew in to guard him every night while he was making this Gatbawi Buddha.  It is reputed to be a miraculous Buddha stone, which makes a response to prayers if the prayer prays for it with his or her whole heart.

'''Harlon Henry Block''' (November 6, 1924 – March 1, 1945) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] corporal who was killed in action during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

Born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], Block joined the Marine Corps with seven high school classmates in February 1943, and subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]] and Iwo Jima. He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second  [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

The [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.

== Early life ==
Block was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |title=Famed Iwo Jima flag raisers gone but not forgotten |publisher=Marines.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007080257/http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Block children were: Edward, Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a city located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. His father became a dairy farmer, and the children attended a Seventh-day Adventist private school. Harlon Block was expelled in his freshman year when he refused to tell the principal which student had vandalized the school. Block then transferred to [[Weslaco High School]] and was remembered as an outgoing student with many friends. A natural athlete, Block led the Weslaco Panther Football Team to the Conference Championship. He was honored as "All South Texas End". Block and seven of his high school friends decided on joining the Marine Corps before they graduated and the school held a special early graduation ceremony for them in January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Mark (7/26/2001), ''Iwo Jima: In Memory Of A Friend'', 7/26/2001 [http://www.dianahendricks.com/clips--essays--mark/in-memory-of-a-friend] Retrieved January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adventistreview.org/meet-harlan-block,-the-seventh-day-adventist-who-helped-raise-the-u.s.-flag-on-iwo-jima Meet Harlan Block, the Seventh-day Adventist Who Helped Raise the U.S. Flag on Iwo Jima] Retrieved October 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===

Block and seven of his high school football teammates enlisted together in the Marine Corps through the [[Selective Service System]] at [[San Antonio]] on February 18, 1943 and were sent to recruit training at the [[MCRD San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]] in [[San Diego]]. On April 14, Block began [[parachute]] training at the Marine Parachute Training School in San Diego, and on May 22, he qualified as a [[Paramarine]] and was promoted to [[private first class]]. He was sent to the [[Pacific Theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. He arrived at [[New Caledonia]] on November 15, where he served as a member of Headquarters and Service Company, [[1st Marine Parachute Regiment]], [[I Marine Amphibious Corps]]. On December 21, he landed on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. On December 22, 1st Parachute Battalion, Weapons Company and a Headquarters and Service platoon attached to the 2nd Marine Raider Regiment, relieved the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines]] in the vicinity of Eagle Creek on Bougainville. Block returned to San Diego with his unit on February 14. On February 29, the parachutists disbanded and Block joined the Second Platoon, E Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]] on March 1. He was promoted to [[corporal]] on October 27, 1944.

==== Flag raising(s) on Mount Suribachi ====

On February 19, 1945, Block landed with the Second Battalion, 28th Marines who were nearest to Mount Suribachi at the southern end of Iwo Jima which was the battalion's objective, and fought in the battle for the capture of the island. On February 23, a 40-man patrol from mostly Third Platoon, Easy Company, was sent up Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest and raise an American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured. The patrol led by First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]] who carried the battalion's flag, left 8 AM and soon made it to the top of Mount Suribachi. The flag was raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]], and Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. Thomas was interviewed by CBS radio broadcaster Dan Pryor on February 25, 1945, aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''".&lt;/ref&gt;  After a brief firefight with Japanese soldiers who were hiding in caves after the flag was raised, the summit was secured.

It was determined that the flag was too small to be seen on the north side of Mount Suribachi (where most of the Japanese were located and heavier fighting would occur), so another, larger flag was called for. At around noon or so, Marine Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] was ordered to take three of his squad members in Second Platoon up to the top of Suribachi with supplies and raise a replacement flag. He then chose Cpl. Block (assistant squad leader), Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the mountain. Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]], the Easy Company runner (messenger), was ordered to take the flag up and return with the first flag.

Once on top, Strank told Hayes and Sousley to find a pipe to be used for a flagpole to tie the flag on. The flag was attached to a Japanese steel pipe they found, and as the four Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, Strank called for help from Gagnon and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] (Navy corpsman [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] was incorrectly identified as a flag-raiser until June 23, 2016)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The six Marines then raised the replacement flag together as the first flag and flagstaff was lowered under Lt. Schrier's command. The second raising was immortalized forever by the black and white photo of the flag raising by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]]. This flag-raising was also filmed in color by Sergeant [[Bill Genaust]] who was [[killed in action]] on March 4. Strank was killed in action on March 1, and Sousley on March 21, five days before the battle ended on March 26.

==== Death ====
According to the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley), Block then assumed command of Strank's squad in Second Platoon after Strank was killed on March 1, and later the same day Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Block's last words were, "They killed me!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|title=Flags of Our Fathers|date=May 2000|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553589-34-2|pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ralph Griffiths, a member of the same platoon as Block, claimed that Strank and Block were killed instantly by the same shell which wounded him on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://taishawalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/iwo-jima-survivor-recalls-the-bloody-war/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://listen.sdpb.org/post/marine-veterans-recall-iwo-jima#stream/0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/14/veteran-of-easy-company-recalls-rigors-of-iwo-jima/?print]&lt;/ref&gt; Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima in 1945. A service was held there on March 26 which included Hayes and other members of Easy Company. In January 1949, Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|18154|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag raising controversy ==
[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|A photo to show the identities of the six second flag-raisers on Mt. Suribachi]]
A controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, "That's Harlon", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, "I know my boy."

On March 27, 1945, the 28th Marines departed Iwo Jima for Hawaii. On March 30, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered the Marine Corps to send the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington, D.C. where it was determined that Hansen was in the photograph. On April 7, [[Rene Gagnon]] (Easy Company's runner (messenger)), mistakenly identified the person in the photograph as Sergeant [[Henry O. Hansen|Hank Hansen]] of [[Boston]] (Hansen was a member of Third Platoon of Company E, who had participated in the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi earlier that morning).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, the Marine Corps released publicly the names of the six flag-raisers in the photograph which were identified by Gagnon (he also incorrectly identified Bradley in the photograph).&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; When Navy corpsman John Bradley (Third Platoon corpsman, Easy Company, who was involved with the first flag-raising on Suribachi) arrived in Washington, D.C. a few days later, Bradley (he incorrectly identified himself in the photograph)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; concurred with Gagnon that Hansen was in the photograph. However, on April 19, when Ira Hayes (Second Platoon) arrived in Washington, D.C., he told the lieutenant colonel interviewing him (also interviewed Gagnon and Bradley) about who the flag-raisers were, that an "error" was made, Block (Second Platoon) and not Hansen was at the base of the flagstaff in the photo. Hayes (who incorrectly identified Bradley in the photograph)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; was then told the six names were already released and since Block and Hansen were both deceased, to not say a word about it again&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;(the lt. colonel later claimed Hayes never mentioned Block's name to him).

In 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home and told him Harlon was in the photograph. Mrs. Block then persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes's written statements and letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945, were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Hansen was not (Hayes, and Hansen who wore parachutist boots on Suribachi... were former [[Paramarines]]). Gagnon and Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that "it could be Block" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.

==Plot summary==
An easy going young man named Jack, a bit of a directionless 'lost-soul' and previous hedonistic 'wild-child' alcoholic (and unfortunate believer that most he's attempted in life he's failed at miserably) is attempting to, on this his seventh straight year of sobriety, to straighten out his life once and for all by taking his relationship in a more serious direction with a proposal of marriage. He's [[cohabitation|living with]] his partner Camilla, an assertive aspiring young doctor who is pretty much the driving force (not to mention, main financial supporter) of their otherwise contented life together. And even though he live in a house bought and paid for by Camilla's wealthy father, still Jack struggles to afford an engagement ring to go with the very proposal he's just sprung on his tearfully accepting now fiancee. Camilla, not only jumps straight into reception planning, but having previously suffered a problematic miscarriage, pregnancy preoccupation and planning has shot to the top of her priorities list. Jack, though terrified at the idea of becoming a father, is nevertheless even more fearful of loosing the only thing truly stable and loving in his life, so silently acquiesces to fiancee's wishes. But... little does he know just how much his life is about to change, when he answers the door to someone he doesn't immediately recognise but who certainly seems to know him...  

The incessant ringer at the door, who's just showed up and about to implode his life with a mere but loaded sentence, is Anna ([[Anna Friel]]). Soon Jack is reminded that Anna is someone he drunkenly hooked-up with at some concert 8 years previously - a [[one-night stand]] as it happens - and informs him that they have a seven-year-old son called Phoenix. At first Jack is rude and dismissive, clutching at denials and misremembered snippets of having worn a condom. But Anna's insistence on a paternity test soon sets him on the right path to accept and meet his son. Jack begins to spend time with Phoenix but is reluctant to tell Camilla about everything that has been going on, unsure how to juggle both sides of his life at once. Meanwhile, Camilla's meticulous ovulation tracking soon means that Jack is about to be father for a second time. However, fearful of losing out, Jack mishandles the situation by not be ing honest with either party. Camilla, however, soon finds out the truth when Phoenix needs to be rushed to the hospital she's working at after a nasty fall from a jungle-gym at the playground during one of their weekly visits. Consequently, feeling lied to and betrayed, Camilla kicks Jack out the house, cancels their wedding plans and wants nothing to do with him. Jack is rather devastated and attempts to explain and set things right, but ultimately understands that the right choice is actually making his son his priority and two just give the situation some time.  

Later it is revealed that Anna has a [[terminal illness]] ([[ovarian cancer]]) and that Anna's awareness of doomed fate is what prompted her to seek out Jack in the first place. In order that Phoenix not be left alone in the world after such a traumatic event as losing his mother. She asks Jack to promise to care for Phoenix as he'll be needing his father more than ever once she's gone - which Jack immediately agrees and promises to do. In the end Anna dies and Phoenix goes to live with Jack, who eventually makes things right with Camilla too. The film ends just before Camilla is due to give birth to their baby. But it's implied that the four will go on to heal and grow into one happy family together, finally having all they wished for (even more so!) at the beginning of the film.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Having You 2013 at Finite Films|url=http://www.finitefilmsandtv.com/having-you-film/|publisher=finitefilmsandtv.com|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conformed to the tropical setting of Indonesia, the style became known in the Dutch East Indies as Indies Empire style.

==History==
===Rise of the Indies Empire style===
The development of the Indies Empire style is strongly related with the [[Indos in colonial history|Indies culture]], a society of mixed descendants which developed in the Dutch East Indies.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=1}} Indies people associated themselves with high status and expressed themselves by building opulent [[Dutch Indies country houses|country houses]] usually associated with European aristocrats.{{sfn|Milone|1967|pp=408}}{{sfn|Nas|2009|pp=128–30}} Many of these country houses appeared in the periphery of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] around the middle of 17th-century, the architectural style of which reached its peak when it merged completely with the [[Javanese traditional house|Javanese local architecture]], a new style known as the [[Dutch Indies country houses|Old Indies style]].

With the arrival of [[Herman Willem Daendels]] in early 19th-century, the development of the architectural style of these country houses took a different course. Daendels was a former [[colonel-general]] of [[Louis Bonaparte]] from France. At that time, a neoclassical architectural movement named [[Empire Style]] was popular in France. When Daendels was made the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]], he made Empire Style popular in the Dutch East Indies. Conformed with the tropical architecture of Indonesia, the style became known as the Indies Empire Style.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=8}}

[[File:Musetextil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Textile Museum (Jakarta)|Textile Museum]] in Jakarta, an example of a later period of Indies Empire style with the additions of corrugated steel shades.]]
By the end of 19th-century, clubhouses and playhouses were built in big cities of the Indies such as [[Colonial buildings in Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surabaya]]; most were built following the Indies Empire style trend.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=11–2}} City development at the end of 19th-century also influenced the form of Indies Empire style. The lack of available space in city centers required modification of typical Indies Empire styled houses. Stone columns were replaced with wooden or narrow iron columns, usually imported from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond|1990|pp=12–5}} Also changing was the additions of corrugated steel shades supported by cast iron consoles to protect the windows and the front porch from rainwater and sun.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond|1990|pp=12–5}} Examples of Indies Empire style houses from this later period are the [[Textile Museum (Jakarta)|Jakarta Textile Museum]] and some houses in Jalan Bubutan, [[Surabaya]].

In the 19th-century, the Indies Empire style is considered a representative of the "uptown" of Batavia, the area south of the "downtown" [[Kota Tua Jakarta|Kota Tua]]. Indies Empire Style is described as a trend in which houses were built in ''"...one storey with large gardens, with front and back galleries and high and wide halls; houses with hanging roofs where shade, air and coolness were the dominant privileges..."'', compared with the earlier [[Landhuis|Dutch style houses]] in Kota Tua, described as houses with ''"...high dark rooms with the beamed ceilings, the white painted walls and the red tiled floors."''{{sfn|Merrillees|2001|p=14}} 

===Decline===
Indies Empire style flourished until early 20th century, when the style was met with criticism. Indies Empire style in Indonesia was not a work of a professional architect, but a design of the building supervisor (''opzichter''). Modern academics such as architects [[Berlage]] and [[Pieter Adriaan Jacobus Moojen|Moojen]] considered the Indies Empire style buildings to be low in quality;{{sfn|Moojen|1924b|pp=105}} which led to a renaissance of architectural style which sought a new unique identity specially attributed to the culture of Dutch Indies. Later a new style emerged, known as the [[New Indies Style]], a modern movement and a branch of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Dutch Rationalism]] which at the end replaced the Indies Empire style.

==Characteristic==
[[File:Merdeka Palace Changing Guard 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Istana Merdeka, a typical residential building in early Indies Empire style.]]
Indies Empire style is essentially Empire Style conformed into the tropical setting of the Dutch East Indies. Similar with the [[Empire Style]], Indies Empire Style made an eclectic use of antique motifs – usually Greco-Roman – to imitate an imperial colonial dynasty. Few buildings in the Indies make reference to the Gothic style e.g. [[Cikini Hospital|the residence of Raden Saleh]]. Layout is symmetrical, with high ceiling, thick walls, and marble floor. Buildings often have a front (''voorgalerij'') and rear gallery (''achtergalerij''), flanked with [[Greek columns]]. This front and rear porticos are very spacious compared with its original European-style to improve [[cross ventilation]] into the interior as well as protecting it from intense tropical heat and rain – a European attempt to imitate the local [[Javanese traditional house|pringgitan]], a Javanese veranda with a bamboo bench where people may sleep during a hot noon. Furniture may be placed in the portico. An afternoon dance party or a card game are usually held in the portico, a tradition which mimics a French tradition more than a Dutch or Javanese tradition.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=11}}

An Indies Empire Style building has a symmetrical layout and composition. It consists of a main building, sometimes with additional pavilions situated at both sides of the main building. The main building contains a central hall which connects both the front and rear portico as well as various rooms inside. A gallery connects the main building with a service building which contains rooms for slaves, storage, kitchen, and other service facilities. The whole compound is situated in a large piece of land with spacious gardens at the front, rear, and sides of the main building. Tropical palm trees usually decorate this landscaping.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=8}}

'''''Inger on the Beach''''' (also ''Summernacht''; [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Inger på stranden, Sommernatt'') is a painting by the Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]]. It was created in the summer of 1889, at [[Åsgårdstrand]] and is a portrait of Munch's youngest sister Inger.

==Description==
A young woman, identified by the title as Munch's youngest sister Inger, sits in a quiet pose, a straw hat in her hands, on a large granite rock and holds her head in profile. Her bright white dress contrasts with the green mossy stones and the blues and purples of the sea water behind her, which, as the alternative titles indicate, suggests ''Nordic summer nights''. Only a few [[Fish trap|pots]] and a fishing boat behind her betray human life in the countryside.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p.17}}

Munch used a similar pose for his 1884 interior composition ''Morning'', featuring a girl on the edge of a bed.{{sfn|O'Neill|1996|p=13}}

==History==
In the summer of 1889, Munch rented a small house in Åsgårdstrand, a small Norwegian coastal town on the [[Oslofjord]], which served as a summer resort of many citizens and artists from nearby Kristiana, now Oslo. Among them were Munch's friends [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Frits Thaulow]]. The place acquired great importance in the life of Munch: Here he spent not only many summers, and bought in 1897 a house, it was the place for many important pictures of his life work. In 1889, his first year in Åsgårdstrand, he painted ''Inger on the beach''. The model was his youngest sister Inger, who had previously modeled for him. The painting was preceded by a series of studies Munch made between 9 and 11 pm to study the lighting conditions of Norwegian summer night.{{sfn|Heller|1993|p. 38.}}

==Interpretation==
Ulrich Bischoff suggests that—unlike Munch's earlier 1884 portrait of the then 14-year-old Inger in her black [[First Communion|confirmation]] dress, a youthful work in the tradition of portraiture of the 19th century—''Inger on the beach'' shows the future importance of the artist. Munch displays in this work his artistic repertoire for expressing loneliness, melancholy and angst, and foreshadows the compositional breakdown in horizontal and vertical axes of the later ''Frieze of Life''.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|pp. 17-18}}

For Reinhold Heller the painting conveys less a time of day than a mood, created by the contours and dimensional representations of figure and stones, the nonexistent horizon between sky and sea, and the almost monochrome blue.{{sfn|Heller|1993|p. 38.}}
Anni Carlsson describes the work as a "character landscape" in which the beach, sea and figure are incorporated into a mood and the boundaries cancel space. 

In a later statement, Munch compared seaside rocks with living creatures, goblins and sea spirits:{{sfn|Carlsson|1989|p. 33.}} "In the night's light which forms have fantastic tones". Nicolay Stang compares the "simplification of form and color, which is a colored form against the other" to Paul Gauguin, a painter whose work was familiar to Munch before 1889.{{sfn|Stang|1981|p. 33}}

Tone Skedsmo says ''Inger on the beach'' is in the tradition of the naturalistic painters of the "Fleksum colony", namely [[Christian Skredsvig]], [[Eilif Peterssen]], [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Gerhard Munthe]], [[Kitty Kielland]] and [[Harriet Backer]], who were known for their quiet summer night moods. While the composition of a figure in a landscape and the elegiac mood are typical of the work of Munch's Norwegian colleagues, Munch's simplification of forms to express a mood adds elements of modernity. He may have been influenced by [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]], whom he had met at the [[Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (1885)]], in the rigid countenance of Ingers with her blank stare and the dry handling of the paint.

==Reception==
A few months after its completion, the painting (originally titled ''Evening'') was displayed for the first time at the annual autumn exhibition in Kristiana, while Munch had already traveled to Paris to collect impressions of the local art scene through which his [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] would find expressive style.{{sfn|Skedsmo|1988}} 
The contemporary criticism was extremely hostile.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p. 18}} 
''Morgenbladet'' called the painting pure "gibberish" and said the public was being bamboozled. Other voices criticized the "easily thrown stones that seem to be made only from soft, shapeless substance".{{sfn|Stang|1981|p. 33}}
''Aftenposten'' described the seated figure as "a physical entity with no trace of life and expression, as untrue in the form as in the color [...] On the whole this seems to us to have such a low artistic value that his presence at the exhibition itself is difficult to defend. " Dagbladet nevertheless pointed out: "To understand it, one must constantly have in mind that Munch poet is - a person who can be entirely covered by a mood to her and her playing devotedly, without regard to conventional laws and forms, often with a tendency to fantasy. "{{sfn|Carlsson|1989|p. 34.}}

Munch's Norwegian colleague [[Erik Werenskiold]] bought it directly from the exhibition{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p. 18}} in 1909; it was acquired in 1924 by the Norwegian art collector [[Rasmus Meyer]] as part of his public collections in Bergen.

'''Interactive architecture''' refers to the branch of [[architecture]] which deals with buildings featuring the trio of sensors, processors and effectors, embedded as a core part of its nature and functioning. Interactive architecture encompasses [[building automation]] but goes beyond it by including forms of interaction engagements and responses that may lay in pure communication purposes as well as in the emotive and artistic realm, thus entering the field of [[Interactive art]].

[[Category:Architecture]]
'''Interactive architecture''' part of the [[Internet of things]], a term first coined by '''Kevin Ashton of Procter &amp; Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999''', can include both interior and exterior elements. Within the interior, many technologies are competing to see who will emerge as the dominant communicative signal. 4GLTE [[LTE (telecommunication)]] being replaced eventually by [[5G]], is the obvious solution, however [[Visible light communication]] or [[Li-Fi]], a term first introduced by '''Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh''', is gaining ground as research into this type of data transfer method increases. '''Interactive architecture''' and designing our buildings with this technology embedded in it, is essential in the development of '''smart cities'''.

Another essential element in the development of a [[Smart city]] is the [[Landscape architecture]]. The space in-between buildings used by the public, or the public realm as it is more commonly termed. There are two levels of communication within the public realm and the difference between the two are commonly accepted as the differentiation between IoT and IoE. IoE, or The Internet of Everything, was a phrase first used by Cisco in an attempt to achieve polarity with competitors that had embraced the term IoT. In Cisco's definition however, they highlighted one main difference between IoT and IoE. This difference being interaction with the human node.

The two public realm communication protocols that make that space a smart space are:

'''The Intelligent Realm, i-realm.''' Defined as a realm designed with embedded '''information and communication technology''', which allows the silo elements of that space, lighting, ventilation, traffic signals, transportation, waste management, to communicate with one another for the purpose of making that urban area more efficient and effective.

The second communication protocol is '''The Interactive Realm'''. Defined as incorporating all of the technology needed to create an intelligent realm but in addition, using communication methods such as [[Global Positioning System]], [[Geo-fence]], [[Near-field communication]]' and embedded [[Bluetooth Low Energy]], to allow communication between the architecture of the space and the consumers of it. Sometimes referred to as the '''physical web''' by [[Google]], an interactive realm uses exterior '''lighting, bollards, street furniture''', bus stops and other elements to communicate to the public via their [[Smartphone]] or tablet. 

Whilst IoT concerns itself with communication between objects in order to make the design more efficient and interactive from an operational stand point. IoE in addition also incorporates communication between embedded objects and user devices. The applications are endless but include, [[Wayfinding]], safety, anti-terrorism, [[Targeted advertising]], general information such as history of the space''' or simply just to make the space more enjoyable.</text>

In mathematical physics, '''inversion transformations''' are a natural extension of [[Poincaré transformation]]s to include all [[conformal map|conformal]] [[bijection|one-to-one]] transformations on coordinate [[space-time]]. They are less studied in physics because unlike the rotations and translations of Poincaré symmetry an object cannot be physically transformed by the inversion symmetry. Some physical theories are invariant under this symmetry, in these cases it is what is known as a 'hidden symmetry'. Other hidden symmetries of physics include [[gauge symmetry]] and [[general covariance]].

==Early use==
In 1831 the mathematician [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]] began to publish on transformations of the plane generated by inversion in a circle of radius ''R''. His work initiated a large body of publications, now called [[inversive geometry]]. The most prominently named mathematician became [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] once he reduced the planar transformations to [[complex number]] arithmetic. In the company of physicists employing the inversion transformation early on was [[Lord Kelvin]], and the association with him leads it to be called the [[Kelvin transform]].

==Transformation on coordinates==
In the following we shall use imaginary time (&lt;math&gt;t'=it&lt;/math&gt;) so that space-time is Euclidean and the equations are simpler. The Poincaré transformations are given by the coordinate transformation on space-time parametrized by the 4-vectors&amp;nbsp;''V''

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime = O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\mu \,  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an [[orthogonal matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-vector. Applying this transformation twice on a [[4-vector]] gives a third transformation of the same form. The basic invariant under this transformation is the space-time length given by the distance between two [[space-time]] points given by 4-vectors ''x'' and&amp;nbsp;''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;r = |x - y |. \, &lt;/math&gt;

These transformations are subgroups of general 1-1 conformal transformations on space-time. It is possible to extend these transformations to include all 1-1 conformal transformations on [[space-time]]

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( A_\tau ^\nu V_\nu +B_\tau \right) \left( C_{\tau \mu
}^\nu V_\nu +D_{\tau \mu }\right) ^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

We must also have an equivalent condition to the orthogonality condition of the Poincaré transformations:

:&lt;math&gt;AA^T+BC=DD^T+CB \, &lt;/math&gt;

Because one can divide the top and bottom of the transformation by &lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; we lose no generality by setting &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the unit matrix. We end up with

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\tau \right) \left( \delta _{\tau
\mu} + Q_{\tau \mu }^\nu V_\nu \right) ^{-1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Applying this transformation twice on a 4-vector gives a transformation of the same form. The new symmetry of 'inversion' is given by the 3-tensor &lt;math&gt;Q.&lt;/math&gt; This symmetry becomes Poincaré symmetry if we set &lt;math&gt;Q=0.&lt;/math&gt; When &lt;math&gt;Q=0&lt;/math&gt; the second condition requires that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal matrix. This transformation is 1-1 meaning that each point is mapped to a unique point only if we theoretically include the points at infinity.

==Invariants==
The invariants for this symmetry in 4 dimensions is unknown however it is known that the invariant requires a minimum of 4 space-time points. In one dimension, the invariant is the well known [[cross-ratio]] from [[Möbius transformation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-X)(y-Y)}{(x-Y)(y-X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the only invariants under this symmetry involve a minimum of 4 points, this symmetry cannot be a symmetry of point particle theory. Point particle theory relies on knowing the lengths of paths of particles through space-time (e.g., from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;). The symmetry can be a symmetry of a [[string theory]] in which the strings are uniquely determined by their endpoints. The [[propagator]] for this theory for a string starting at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(x,X)&lt;/math&gt; and ending at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(y,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a conformal function of the 4-dimensional invariant. A string field in endpoint-string theory is a function over the endpoints.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x,X). \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Physical evidence==
Although it is natural to generalize the Poincaré transformations in order to find hidden [[symmetries]] in physics and thus narrow down the number of possible theories of [[high-energy physics]], it is difficult to experimentally examine this symmetry as it is not possible to transform an object under this symmetry. The indirect evidence of this symmetry is given by how accurately fundamental theories of physics that are invariant under this symmetry make predictions. Other indirect evidence is whether theories that are invariant under this symmetry lead to contradictions such as giving probabilities greater than 1. So far there has been no direct evidence that the fundamental constituents of the Universe are strings. The symmetry could also be a [[broken symmetry]] meaning that although it is a symmetry of physics, the Universe has 'frozen out' in one particular direction so this symmetry is no longer evident.

'''Kunstterrorist Organisation''' (from a [[German language|German]] phrase "Kunst" meaning "Art"), aka '''KTOrg''', is a radical [[art collective]] from [[Croatia]] founded by graphic designer/artist [[Filip Filkovic]].

==Art==
KTOrg is probably best known for the controversial [[politics|political]] art works created by its founder, Filip Filkovic. Filkovic was also involved in the making of art pieces for the [[Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice]] project founded by [[James Cauty]] of [[The KLF]]. Together with Cauty, Filkovic created some of the works in 2007 and 2008 until the final closure of CNPD. According to the official website of Kunstterrorist Organisation, all the works ever created and published via their web shop hold direct reference to popular culture via [[dystopian]] and [[counterculture]] themes, and also directly criticizes the world government's policies and the erosion of [[Political freedom|freedom]]. Along with limited edition printed works, Filkovic also produces [[Cinderella stamp]] artwork. During the C2 exhibition in [[Zagreb]] in 2008, Filkovic published a number of highly controversial works which reflected the popular culture and criticised Croatian high officials. His work "iVo", which features Croatian prime minister [[Ivo Sanader]] wearing [[iPod]] headphones, was a well-discussed work in the media and gathered a number of positive reactions. In addition to "iVo" as an artwork, KTOrg announced that "iVo" (now a fictional character in the fictional monarchy "Counterculture Monarchy of Discordianism") was to be elected president of the monarchy. For that purpose, a fictional website was set up at www.ivoforpresident.com.

==Multimedia activism==
Along with [[guerilla activism]], members of KTOrg are involved in music production, known as "Kunstterrorist Audio Noize". The audio tracks are released via the British anti-label [[Death to Music]]. The band consists of six members and the music varies in genre from [[electronica]] to [[punk music|punk]]/[[rock music|rock]] and [[Gabber|gabba]]. The members of Kunstterrorist Audio Noize also created a number of remixes for other bands.

==Characteristics==
KTOrg is influenced by and constantly references the [[culture jamming]] movement in art, activism and music. The organisation also strongly supports [[Copyleft]] and [[Free Culture Movement]] and apparently (according to their official web site) is giving away everything it has ever created for free on December 12, 2012. KTOrg's work also references [[discordianism]] as a major influence. The discordianism references are most obvious in the organization's frequent newsletters and the information given on its official web page.

'''LAB HD''' was a three-year experiment by [[Voom HD Networks]]. It is the only channel in history devoted to video art and experimental film as a continuous flow of ambient television. While it is no longer broadcasting, the channel persists as Voom HD Lab, an outreach effort on the part of its parent company, and it continues to commission pieces from artists and filmmakers.

Voom launched as a DBS (direct broadcast satellite) service in the United States in October 2003. The service offered 21 channels of high-definition video focused on niche audiences.  Most of the channels were conventional offerings, but one slot was reserved for an experimental channel called [[Moov HD|MOOV HD]]. The channel was produced by Concrete Pictures, a design and production house in Philadelphia founded by Jeff Boortz. The intent was to produce video art for public consumption. The branding of the channel was elegant, but the content was of uneven quality, and it was derided as "the [[screensaver]] channel."

Voom assigned [[Ali Hossaini]] to serve as executive producer of the channel. He began revamping the programming with high-profile productions, notably a series of "video portraits" directed by Robert Wilson and produced by Noah Khoshbin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-c5073773feb01,0,1704020.story&lt;/ref&gt; New strands of programming were introduced, such as Tank TV and Micro TV. The former featured public aquariums and the latter photomicroscopy in high-definition. Concrete Pictures produced a program called Space, which stitched together footage from NASA into ambient video.

Efforts to transform the channel culminated on January 1, 2004, when it was relaunched as LAB HD, with the tagline, Experiments in High Definition. Hossaini hired filmmaker Lili Chin to manage a new Outreach Program that would put high-definition gear, including cameras and a post-production facility, into the hands of selected artists. Chin succeeded in attracted a range of talent from the orbit of Anthology Film Archives. LAB HD has deep connections to [[Anthology Film Archives]], where Lili Chin curates film programs and [[Ali Hossaini]] serves on the Board of Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transmag.org/mailer/mailer26/ Trans News&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2005 LAB HD productions thrived. Director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] produced avant-garde video pieces with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/hdtv/hd_still_life_artist_wilson_1227/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315053312/http://broadcastengineering.com/hdtv/hd_still_life_artist_wilson_1227/ |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hossaini also collaborated with Sandra Antelo-Suarez  of Trans Gallery on her project, ''Don’t Trust Anyone Over 30'', a rock and roll puppet show conceived by Dan Graham. Originally staged with live puppets at Miamia Basel,&lt;ref&gt;http://artdaily.com/news/11724/Don-t-Trust-Anyone-Over-Thirty-by-Dan-Graham#.VwMLxRMrLsk Art Daily News&lt;/ref&gt; a video version of the show was directed by [[Tony Oursler]] for the 2006 Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;http://whitney.org/www/2006biennial/artists.php?artist=DTAOT Whitney&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum of the Moving Image put LAB HD on permanent exhibit as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amcnetworks.com/press-releases/vooms-equator-hd-names-ali-hossaini-executive-producer AMC Networks&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately LAB HD did not meet the criteria to survive as a commercial channel. It had been conceived as an ambient channel, and, in his notes, Hossaini refers to [[Jerry Mander]]'s book ''[[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]'' as a model for the channel. The channel was a continuous flow of non-narrative images and sounds, mostly music. It was meant to provoke reflection not distraction. This presented a weak value proposition from a marketing standpoint, and, on January 1, 2006, it was replaced by another innovative format, a video gaming channel that has garnered considerably more attention (outside the art world).

Voom HD Networks decided to keep the Outreach Program under the name Voom HD Lab, with [[Ali Hossaini]] as executive producer and Lili Chin as associate producer. Voom HD Lab has supported the work of numerous artists and filmmakers, many of whom had never worked in high-definition video. LAB productions appeared in numerous museums, film festivals and galleries.

A '''letterer''' is a member of a team of [[comic book creator]]s responsible for drawing the comic book's text. The letterer's use of [[typeface]]s, [[calligraphy]], letter size, and [[page layout|layout]] all contribute to the impact of the comic. The letterer crafts the comic's [[lettering|"display lettering"]]: the story title lettering and other special captions and credits that usually appear on a story's first page. The letterer also writes the letters in the [[word balloon]]s and draws in [[onomatopoeia|sound effects]]. Many letterers also design logos for the comic book company's various titles.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
By the time comic books came of age in the 1940s, the huge volume of work demanded by publishers had encouraged an assembly-line process, dividing the creative process into distinct tasks: writer, [[penciller]], letterer, [[inker]], and [[colorist]]. By the late 1940s, it became possible to make a living just lettering comic strips and comic books for artists, studios, and companies that didn't have the time or desire to do it in-house. The career of freelance letterer was born, and by the 1950s, letterers such as [[Gaspar Saladino]], [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]], and [[Ben Oda]] were crafting full-time careers as letterers for [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], and [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/LetteringTop.html "How it all began," Todd Klein: Lettering – Logos – Design.] Retrieved July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[Image:SandmanEndless.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Four panels from ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' #21, demonstrating multiple [[Harvey Award]]-winning letterer Todd Klein's different styles for members of [[Endless (comics)|The Endless]].]] --&gt;

Letterer and logo designer [[Ira Schnapp]] defined the DC Comics look for nearly thirty years. Starting in 1940, he designed or refined such iconic logos as ''[[Action Comics]]'', ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', and ''[[Justice League of America]]'', while also creating the distinctive appearance of DC's house ads and promotions. (Schnapp also designed the [[Comics Code Authority]] seal, which was a fixture on comic book covers from all major companies for over forty years.)&lt;ref name="chill"&gt;Kimball, Kirk. [http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/376/ "The Big Chill," Dial B for Blog #376 (Oct. 10, 2006).] Retrieved July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in around 1966, Schnapp's classic, art deco-inspired look was replaced by the pulsing, organic style of [[Gaspar Saladino]], who redesigned DC's house style for the [[counterculture]] era.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;B.D.S.

Accessed May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaspar's work became so iconic that various independent comics publishers which sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s – such as [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics|Atlas/Seaboard]],&lt;ref name="Gaspar Saladino — Atlas Shrugged!"&gt;Kimball, Kirk.

From the 1930 through the 1990s (with a few exceptions), the letterer plied his craft on the same page drawn by the penciler. (The penciled art was then inked after the letterer has completed his work on the page.) At DC Comics during the "[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]" of the 1960s, pencilers were required to "rough in balloons and sound effects" for the letterers to later go over. An accomplished letterer was able to adapt his or her style to the style of the art for that particular book.&lt;ref&gt;Letterer [[Clem Robins]], quoted in Kimball, Kirk.

=== Computer lettering ===
The evolution of desktop publishing powered by computers, especially those made by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], began in the 1980s, and started having a gradual impact on comics lettering soon after. One of the first users of computer-generated lettering was writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], who made fonts from existing lettering. (Incidentally, Byrne made use of existing lettering by other artists, such as [[Dave Gibbons]], without their permission.&lt;ref name="computer"&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/ComputerLettering.html "Computer lettering," Todd Klein: Lettering – Logos – Design.] Retrieved July 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Now Byrne uses a computer font based on the handwriting of letterer [[Jack Morelli]] – with Morelli's permission.)&lt;ref name="FAQProcess"&gt;Byrne Robotics FAQ: [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=6&amp;T1=Creative+Process Creative Process]. Retrieved December 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early users of computer lettering were [[David Cody Weiss]]&lt;ref name="computer" /&gt; and [[Roxanne Starr]], who experimented in computer lettering with [[Bob Burden]]'s ''[[Flaming Carrot Comics]]''.

Computer lettering really started making an impact with the availability of the first commercial comic book font, "Whizbang" (created by Studio Daedalus) around 1990.

In the early 1990s letterer [[Richard Starkings]] and his partner [[John Roshell]] (formerly Gaushell) began creating comic book fonts and started [[Comicraft]], which has since become the major source of comics fonts (though they have competition from others, such as [[Blambot]]).

In deference to tradition, at first computer lettering was printed out and pasted onto the original artwork, but after a few years, as comics coloring also moved to desktop publishing, digital lettering files began to be used in a more effective way by combining them directly with digital art files, eliminating the physical paste-up stage altogether. [[Wildstorm Comics]] was ahead of the curve, Marvel came around a few years later, and DC held to traditional production methods the longest, but now nearly all lettering is digitally applied.&lt;ref name="computer" /&gt;

In the early years of the 21st Century, the mainstream American comics companies moved almost exclusively to in-house computer lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer.&lt;ref name="Contino" /&gt; [[Chris Eliopoulos]] designed the fonts for Marvel's in-house lettering unit, and [[Ken Lopez]] did the same at DC.&lt;ref name="Contino"&gt;Contino, Jennifer. [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=001693 "ABCs with Orzechowski," Comicon.com: The Pulse (Dec. 30, 2003). Retrieved July 17, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926133441/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=001693 |date=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the trend has swung the other way, with most comics publishers once again using freelance letterers rather than in-house staff. Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.

== Tools and methods ==

=== On-the-board ===
The traditional comic book letterer needs little more than a [[lettering guide]], a pen or brush, [[India ink]], and white paint for corrections. Some situations required the letterer to use [[vellum]] overlays on top of the original art.&lt;ref name="Gaspar Saladino — Atlas Shrugged!"/&gt;

=== EC Comics ===
The lettering in the comics of the sensationalist [[horror comics]] publisher [[EC Comics]] c. 1945–c. 1955 was different from other publishers — its mechanical appearance gave it a sterile aspect, and helped define the particular style of comics EC was known for. EC's letterers achieved their particular look by using a Leroy lettering set, a device popular amongst draftsmen and architects. The Leroy lettering set consisted of a stylus and a [[pantographic]] lettering form.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Casey. [http://caseyburns.com/artwork/font-design/ "Squa Tront and Spa Fon (2001),"] Casey Burns official website. Accessed May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer lettering ===
Most Marvel and DC books are now lettered using a graphics program such as [[Adobe Illustrator]] or [[Adobe Photoshop]], and a [[font]] that resembles hand lettering. Computer lettering provides a lot of technical shortcuts, especially by combining the lettering work directly with digital art files, eliminating the tedious physical paste-up stage altogether.

There are also still comics artists and inkers who prefer to have the lettering directly on their pages. First, it saves drawing time (not having to put art where a big caption will be); and second, comics tell a story, and a page of comics art without the lettering is only half the story.

Long-time letterer [[John Workman]] toes a middle ground between traditional and digital lettering. In addition to his "on-the-art boards work," Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] tablet.

== Awards and recognition ==
Both the [[Eisner Award]]s and the [[Harvey Award]]s feature a "best letterer" category. (The [[Shazam Award]]s also had a "best letterer" category until the Awards' demise in 1975.) Since the creation of the Eisner and Harvey lettering awards (in 1993 and 1992, respectively), [[Todd Klein]] has dominated the Eisner, winning fifteen times, and has come away with the Harvey eight times. Other repeat Harvey Award winners include [[Ken Bruzenak]], [[Chris Ware]], [[John Workman]], and [[Dan Clowes]].

'''''The Madonna and Child with St John and Angels''''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1497), also known as '''''The Manchester Madonna''''', is an unfinished painting attributed to [[Michelangelo]] in the [[National Gallery]], [[London]]. It is one of three surviving panel paintings attributed to the artist and is dated to his first period in [[Rome]]. The painting's attribution to Michelangelo was in doubt for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, but now most scholars are in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng809 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The work first came to public attention in the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Art Treasures Exhibition]] in [[Manchester]] in 1857, hence the title the “Manchester Madonna”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cookson|2002|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Renaissance paintings of the Madonna and Child which include John the Baptist, the subject arises from a non-Biblical tradition that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus]] met  Christ's cousin St [[John the Baptist]], on the [[Holy Family]]'s [[Flight into Egypt]]. The Virgin is depicted with one breast bared, as if she has recently been suckling her infant son; this recalls the theme of the Virgin breastfeeding common in medieval painting. In her hands is a book (traditionally Isahia chapt. 53) which she attempts to hold away from her son, the contents of which probably foretell his future sacrifice and his taking over himself the evil of the world. She looks over her left shoulder onto a scroll being read by a pair of angels; this is likely to be the scroll reading ''[[Lamb of God|Ecce Agnus Dei]]'' ('Behold the Lamb of God'), usually an attribute of John the Baptist. 

The figures are arranged as if in a frieze, revealing Michelangelo's sculptor's mindset. The frieze becomes more convex at its centre with the figures of Virgin and Child, as in the later ''[[Pitti Tondo]]''. Another similarity to [[relief sculpture]] is in the plain background: rather than the landscapes more common for exterior settings, Michelangelo has simply painted an expanse of sky. He also eschewed the richly decorated throne typical of ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' altarpieces, and de-emphasised the angels' wings.

Many areas of the painting are in a preliminary state; the black of the Virgin's robe was meant to be overpainted with the rich blue pigment [[lapis lazuli]], and the angels on the left are indicated only by the green underpaint used for flesh tones in a kind of non-finito.
RECENT  DISCOVERIES{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
In 2017 scholars have discovered an extratooth or mesiodens in the Child which is a  proof for the attribution to Michelangelo. Moreover, the painting is thematically and i iconographically connected to a fresco by Piero della Francesca in Arezzo (see Sandro Giometti, "Michelangelo: mostrare l'invisibile-displaying the invisible" ed.TAU Todi (Italy) 2018, pgs 1-33. The same author has discovered, in June 2018, a self-portrait of Michelangelo and an 'ichthys' in the folds of Maria's cloak, between her arms.

[[Paul Muldoon]]'s poem '''''Meeting the British''''', first published in the 1987 collection of the same name, is an account of the native [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] against the British in North America in the 1763, written from an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] perspective. The conflict is the first recorded case of [[biological warfare]], in which the British subjugated the [[Ottawa Indians]] by introducing non-native diseases, referred to unambiguously in the poem's final line, "two blankets embroidered with [[smallpox]]" .

The poem is thematically a [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] poem that draws on stylistic aspects from the [[modernist]] tradition. Written in nine couplets, its language and structure operate on dual levels catering for both 'quick' readings that evoke direct feeling and more deliberated 'slow' readings, which in absorbing an historical sense deeper emphasises timeless temporal presence. Muldoon critic John Redmond suggests that the 'quick' and the 'slow' are 'the most desirable ' when considered together and in relation to one another.

The poem marks the first meeting between the native Indians and the British colonisers, the metaphorical 'two streams coming together'. As the poem unfolds, soft images of the native's natural surroundings are gradually usurped by linguistically coarse intrusions from the sinister British invaders. The narrator speaks with gentle assonance, 'the snow lavender-blue' is symbolic of natural purity, but this is gradually diluted as the British presence becomes clearer. The lavender is a motif of 'mythical status' as it is a sacred and medicinal 'mother herb' . Its motif significance is lent to that of the natives and its repetition underscores the poem's component parts, most potently referenced in the line 'C'est la lavande'. Spoken in native French by the British Colonel, it signifies the point of colonial intrusion.

The discordance in their arrival is represented in the splitting of 'handkerchief' across two couplets. Itself a symbol of man-made industry that is at odds with nature, what at first reads 'the Colonel shook out his hand', implicit of the native's trusting nature, on further reading turns the final word to 'handkerchief', exposing the coloniser's eventual deceit, which culminates in the exchange of smallpox-infected blankets that the native Indians naively accept.

Composed in the months before Muldoon moved to America from his native [[Northern Ireland]]; the eponymous 'Meeting the British', in its treatment of Northern American history, simultaneously alludes to [[Irish politics]].  This lends the poem a certain geographical resonance from Muldoon's life. There are significant parallels between Muldoon's native Northern Ireland and North America; two countries that have been subjected to British colonisation in the past.  The Middle Ages saw the gradual extension of British imperial control in Ireland, which culminated in the victory over the province of [[Ulster]] in 1603, giving the British total power over the country .

As a criticism of [[colonialism]], it uses direct reference to colonizers [[Jeffery Amherst]] and [[Henry Bouquet]], to attach the poem to its corresponding moment in history. Carefully dispersed, fragmentary language builds upon the historical context to allude to a wider sense of the violating nature of colonisation.

In [[literature]], '''mood''' is the atmosphere of the narrative.  Mood is created by means of [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] (locale and surroundings in which the [[narrative]] takes place), [[Tone (literature)|attitude]] (of the narrator and of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] in the narrative), and [[description]]s.  Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree.  Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story.  It is to [[fiction]] what the sensory level is to [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.

==Elements==
Mood is generally created through several different things.
Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a [[cowboy]] story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.
The attitude of the [[narrator]] is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is [[diction]], that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.

==Difference from tone== 
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader.  Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, [[Writer's voice|voice]] and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in [[first-person narrative]]s. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/reader-response.php |title=The Author, the Text, and the Reader  |last=Lee Ai Ling |first=Clarissa |publisher=London School of Journalism |date=October 2002|website=English Literature |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7850">The '''Native Writers' Circle of the Americas''' ('''NWCA''') is an organization of Native American writers, most notable for its literary awards, presented annually to Native American writers in three categories: First Book of Poetry, First Book of Prose, and Lifetime Achievement. The awards are voted upon by Native American writers, making it one of the few literary awards presented to Native Americans by Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bibliotopia, Or, Mr. Gilbar's Book of Books &amp; Catch-all of Literary Facts &amp; Curiosities |first=Steven |last=Gilbar |publisher=David R.

The '''Patents Court''' is a specialist court within the [[Chancery Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice]] of England and Wales. It deals with disputes relating to [[intellectual property]], including patents and registered designs. It also hears appeals against decisions of the Comptroller General of Patents.
If a case is deemed suitable to be heard at [[county court]] level, it can be heard in the [[Central London County Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Partington, Introduction to the English Legal System 2012-23 (6th edn, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2011) p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pointillé''' is a decorative technique in which patterns are formed on a surface by a means of punched dots.  The technique is similar to [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] or [[engraving]] but is done manually and does not cut into the surface being decorated.  Pointillé was commonly used to decorate arms and armor starting in the fifteenth century [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dect/hd_dect.htm].  The [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made in France at the end of the 14th century, has very fine and delicate pointillé work in gold.

== Common uses of pointillé ==

Pointillé is commonly used:

* in the decoration of metallic arms and armor
* in the decoration of hand-finished firearms
* in [[bookbinding]] to finish hand-made bookcovers [http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt2621.html]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a point group with more than one axis of rotation or a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation cannot be polar.

A straight line joining unmoved points defines a unique axis of rotation, unless symmetry operations do not allow any rotation at all, such as mirror symmetry, in which case, the polar direction must be parallel to any mirror planes.

== Polar crystallographic point group ==
Of the 32 [[crystallographic point group]]s, 10 are polar:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kasap | first = Safa O. | title = Principles of electronic materials and devices | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780073104645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Roland statue''' is a statue of a [[knight]] with a drawn sword, signifying the [[town privileges]] of a medieval city. Such statues exist in a number of cities notably in northern and eastern [[Germany]], where they are often placed on the market square or in front of the city hall. Examples are also known from [[Central Europe]], [[Croatia]] and [[Latvia]], and there are copies in [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]]. Statues of the mythological [[Roland]], who enjoyed the status as a popular hero, were erected in cities during the [[Middle Ages]] as an emblem of the freedom and city rights of a town. In Germany, such a town is sometimes known as a ''Roland town'' ({{lang-de|Rolandstadt}}). [[Philippe Dollinger]] notes that although there are several Roland statues in the Baltic Sea area, there is nothing specifically [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] about them.&lt;ref name=dollinger&gt;{{cite book |last= Dollinger|first= Philippe|date= 2012|title= Die Hanse|language=German|url= |location= Stuttgart|publisher= Kröner Verlag|page= 359|isbn= 978-3-520-37106-5|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roland statues are known mainly from cities that used [[Sachsenspiegel|Saxon Law]].&lt;ref name=strasse&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.strasse-der-rolande.de/roland_info.php?SID|title= Straße der Rolande|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Active-Vision Multimedia Service Seifert|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Roland statues began to appear in the 12th century, placed outside churches. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Roland statues became more common. Especially during the reign of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], such statues became more common, a fact that may be explained by the Emperor's ambition to portray himself as the heir to [[Charlemagne]]'s reign.&lt;ref name=roland2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forhistiur.de/en/1997-09-munzel-everling/abstract/?l=en|title= Imperial Law and Roland Statues|last1= Munzel-Everling|first1= Dietlinde|last2= |first2= |date= 12 September 1997|website= forum historiae iuris|publisher= Max Planck Institute for European Legal History|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Roland statues were made of wood, while later examples were more often made of stone.&lt;ref name=strasse/&gt;

A '''script supervisor''' (also called '''continuity supervisor''') is a member of a [[film crew]] who oversees the continuity of the motion picture including wardrobe, props, set dressing, hair, makeup and the actions of the actors during a scene. The notes recorded by the script supervisor during the shooting of a scene are used to help the editor cut the scene. They are also responsible for keeping track of the film production unit's daily progress. The script supervisor credit typically appears in the [[closing credits]] of a motion picture and is listed on [[IMDb]] under miscellaneous crew.

In the most basic description, the script supervisor is the editor's and writer's representative on set, as well as being the right hand aide to the director and the director of photography.  It is the script supervisor's job to make sure that at the end of the day the film can be cut together.  In that sense, they back up every department, monitor the script during shooting and make sure that errors in continuity do not occur that would prevent the film from being able to be compiled smoothly in the editing room.

In pre-production, the script supervisor creates a number of reports based on the script, including a one-line continuity synopsis providing basic information on each scene such as the time of day, day in story order, and a one line synopsis of the scene.  These reports are used by various departments in order to determine the most advantageous shot order and ensure that all departments, including production, wardrobe, set dressing, hair and makeup, are in sync in regard to the progression of time within the story.

== Responsibilities ==

During production, the script supervisor acts as a central point for all production information on a film shoot, and has several responsibilities:

* '''Continuity''' – The supervisor is responsible for working with all departments (camera, lighting, sound, wardrobe, make-up, properties and sets) to make sure that [[continuity (fiction)#Continuity errors|continuity errors]] do not happen. The script supervisor takes notes on all the details required to re-create the continuity of a particular scene, location, or action. For every take, the script supervisor will note the duration of the take (usually with a stopwatch) and meticulously log information into a [[daily editor log]] about the action of the take, including position of the main [[actor]](s), [[screen direction]] of their movement, important actions performed during the shot, type of [[photographic lens|lens]] used, and additional information which may vary from case to case.  When multiple cameras are in use, the script supervisor keeps separate notes on each. These logs also notate a director's comments on any particular take as to whether it is no good, a hold take (ok, but not perfect), or a print take (a good take). All of these notes are crucial not just for continuity – they provide the editor information on what the director prefers, any problems with any of the takes and other notes to assist the editing process. 
* '''Axis and Eyelines''' – The script supervisor is also the go-to person for determining the [[180 degree rule|axis]] of a scene. The supervisor keeps track of and helps the director and the camera-operator set the camera position and off-camera [[Eyeline match|eyelines]]  ensuring that the coverage of a scene cuts seamlessly and that the characters within a scene always appear, without any confusion on the part of the viewer, to be looking precisely at the intended character or object.
* '''Slating''' – The script supervisor interacts with the [[clapper loader]] (second camera assistant) and the [[production sound mixer]] to make sure that each take of exposed film has a consistent and meaningful slate, that the sound and picture slates match.  The script supervisor also notes the sound roll of each sync take, and the state of all [[MOS (film)|MOS]] takes.  This ensures that there is proper identification on the film footage in the editing room so the editor can find and use the correct takes.
* '''Script''' – The script supervisor is responsible for keeping the most current version of the [[shooting script]].  During shooting, the script supervisor notates any changes from the [[screenplay]] that are made by the actors, director or others during the actual filming process.  If significant changes are made to the script that affect a future day's shooting, the script supervisor is responsible for providing those changes to the assistant director's team who then will distribute those changes to the rest of the crew.  The script supervisor's script is also referred to as their lined script because during shooting, a script supervisor draws a vertical line down the page for each different camera setup.  Each line designates the start and stop of that setup, a quick note of what the shot description was and whether or not the dialogue was on camera for that setup.  This allows the editor to quickly reference which camera setups cover which portion of the dialogue or action.  
* '''Production Reports''' – At the end of each shooting day, the script supervisor prepares daily reports for the production team. These reports vary in form depending on the studio or production company; however, they generally include a log of the actual times that shooting and breaks started and stopped, and a breakdown of the pages, scenes and minutes that were shot that day, as well as the same information for the previous day, the total script and the amounts remaining to be done. Also included are the number of scenes covered (completely shot), the number of retakes (when a scene has to be reshot), and the number of [[wild track]]s.  The script supervisor is the official timekeeper on any set.
* '''Editor's Notes''' – In addition to the production reports, each shooting day the script supervisor also compiles the continuity logs for the day's shooting as well as the relevant lined script pages for the scenes shot that day.  Those notes are sent off to the editorial staff to assist them in the editing process.

The script supervisor is the primary liaison between the director (who decides what scenes are to be shot) and the editor (who is usually not present during actual filming but needs to have exact records of the filming in order to do the job of cutting the film together). The script supervisor is a technical rather than artistic position and is generally considered as part of the producer's or studio's staff. There is usually only one script supervisor on a given film production.

== Earlier terms ==

Up until the late thirties and early forties, the script supervisor in the American film and television industry was typically called the '''continuity clerk''', '''script reader''' or '''script girl''' and often there were 2 people doing the job.  One was the "continuity clerk" and one was the "script girl". Individuals performing such duties were either credited with these titles or, more often, not credited at all. During this span of time, many script supervisors were indeed women, a fact that originally spawned the title "script girl." However, over the years, script supervisor positions throughout the American motion picture industry became more thoroughly integrated and formed a better balance among men and women. This fact, coupled with producers' desire to promote [[gender neutrality]] in a position that was increasingly taken up by men, produced the gradual change in nomenclature. By the fifties, the gender-specific term had virtually disappeared from film and television credits, but sometimes appeared in everyday speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">The '''Symphony No. 3''' is a composition for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Ned Rorem]].  The work was first performed by the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the direction of [[Leonard Bernstein]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 16, 1959.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rorem |first=Ned |authorlink=Ned Rorem |date=1958 |title=Symphony No. 3 |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Ned-Rorem-Symphony-No-3/5107 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Structure===
The Symphony No. 3 has a duration of roughly 24 minutes and is cast in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Passacaglia
#Allegro molto vivace
#Largo
#Andante
#Allegro molto

The movements were not composed in chronological order; Rorem wrote the "Allegro molto vivace" first, the "Pasacaglia" second, the "Andante" third, the "Largo" fourth, and the "Allegro molto" last.  Rorem called the first movement "a slow overture in the grand style."  The second movement, which the composer described as "a brisk and jazzy dance," had originally been composed as a piece for two pianos eight years prior.  Rorem described the third movements as "a short, passionate page about somnambulism, full of dynamic contrast, and coming from afar."  He called the fourth movement "a farewell to France" and described the fifth and final movement as a miniature [[Concerto for Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=ROREM, N.: Symphonies Nos. 1-3 (Bournemouth Symphony, Serebrier) |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559149&amp;catNum=559149&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English# |access-date=November 3, 2016 |first=José |last=Serebrier |authorlink=José Serebrier |type=CD liner |publisher=[[Naxos Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[piccolo]], two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]], [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[celesta]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Though rarely performed, the symphony has received praise from music critics.  Andrew Farach-Colton of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' praised the symphony, writing, "The first movement passacaglia is simply gorgeous – listen beginning at 3'15" to hear how much Rorem gleaned from [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] – and the two adjacent slow movements are also exquisitely coloured. I find the manic, [[Leonard Bernstein|Bernstein]]-esque scherzo uncharacteristically coarse, though the finale more than makes up for it, providing exhilaration and plenty of orchestral razzle-dazzle without a trace of raucousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Farach-Colton |first=Andrew |title=Rorem Three Symphonies |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/rorem-three-symphonies |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing a 2000 performance at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]], [[Allan Kozinn]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' similarly observed, "It is in some ways very much of its time, in that it embodies an updated form of [[Impressionism in music|Impressionism]], filtered through an American urbanity, as well as stretches of jazzy theatricality in the style of Bernstein (who conducted this work's premiere) and even a trace of [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s faux-Western accent."  He added, "It may also have been a manifesto of sorts, an assertive declaration that tonality and conventional structures still had something to say at a time when [[Serialism]] was ascendant. The work has not been heard very frequently, but today its tonal, eclectic personality is current again: tonality is now acceptable everywhere, and composers 40 years younger than Mr. Rorem (who is a young-looking 76) write music that makes similar allusions."  Kozinn also called it "a demanding work" and wrote, "Its dense, outgoing sections require power and assurance, and its more graceful slow movements require delicacy and a fine balance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kozinn |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |title=MUSIC REVIEW; When Tonality Refused to Stay Quiet |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/06/arts/music-review-when-tonality-refused-to-stay-quiet.html |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Classical architecture]] a '''term''' or '''terminal figure''' (plural: '''terms''' or '''termini''') is a human head and bust that continues as a square  tapering pillar-like form.

The name derives from [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the Roman god of boundaries and boundary markers. If the bust is of [[Hermes]] as protector of boundaries in ancient Greek culture, with male genitals interrupting the plain base at the appropriate height, it may be called a '''[[herma]]''' or '''herm'''.  The crime of [[Alcibiades]] and his drinking-mates, for which [[Socrates]] eventually indirectly paid with his life, was the desecration of herm figures through Athens in the dead of night.

At the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the Lady of Ephesus, whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, was a many-breasted goddess encased in a tapering term, from which her feet protruded. (See illustration at [[Temple of Artemis]]).

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European [[Renaissance]] and the succeeding [[Classicism|Classical styles]], term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[faun]]s and [[Bacchante]]s especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called [[Antwerp Mannerism]]. Engravings disseminated the style through Germany and England.

Term figures as table supports or employed as candlestands (French ''guéridon'') were characteristic of the Late Baroque Louis XIV style in France, the Low Countries and England, revived in the neo-Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] and employed again in the French Empire style of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetantiquegazette.com/furniture/1726_gueridon_definition/|title=Gueridon – definition|publisher=Internet Antique Gazette|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(in the original French ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ou la politique de Machiavel au XIXe siècle'') is a [[political satire]] written by French [[lawyer|attorney]] [[Maurice Joly]] in protest against the regime of [[Napoleon III]], a.k.a. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870.  It was translated into English in 2002.  Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to [[Norman Cohn|Norman Cohn's]] ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', which identifies it as the main source of the later ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.

The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer [[Lucian]] and introduced into the French [[belles-lettres]] by [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of [[Niccolo Machiavelli]] and [[Charles Montesquieu]] meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.

&lt;/ref&gt;
and walking by [[Pont Royal]], he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for [[liberalism]]; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for [[despotism]].

Machiavelli claims that he "... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: "... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails.

&lt;/ref&gt; and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested.  The book was banned.  On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]] in Paris. The second edition of "Dialogues" was issued in 1868 under Joly's name

'''''La Société du Spectacle''''' ('''''Society of the Spectacle''''') is a black and white 1973 film by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]] based on his 1967 [[Society of the Spectacle|book of the same name]]. It was Debord's first feature-length film. It uses [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]] and [[détournement]] in a radical [[Marxist]] [[critique]] of [[mass marketing]] and its role in the [[Social alienation|alienation of modern society]].

==Film content==
The 88 minute film took a year to make and incorporates an apparent jumble of footage from feature films juxtaposed with still photographs, industrial films, early 1970s glossy 'lifestyle' TV ads, and news footage of unrest in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6113599464218751854 The pussies of Guy Debord]'', selected excerpts from the film&lt;/ref&gt; The feature films include ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'', ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', and ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'', as well as other Soviet films.

Throughout the film, there are intertitles consisting of quotations from ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', along with Debord (in voice-over) reading texts from [[Marx]], [[Machiavelli]], the 1968 [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Émile Pouget]], and [[Sergey Solovyov]] and others. Without citations, these quotes are hard to decipher, especially with the conflicting subtitles (which exist even in the French version): but that is part of Debord's goal to "problematize reception" (Greil and Sanborn) and force the viewer to be active. In addition, the words of some of the authors are [[détournement|détourned]] through deliberate misquoting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/SOTS-detournements.html Guide to the détournements in ''The Society of the Spectacle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of historical events is included, such as the murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (the assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963), the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[May 1968 in France|Paris riots]] in May 1968, along with clips of people such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the Spanish anarchist [[Durruti]].

In 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron [[Gerard Lebovici]]. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife [[Alice Becker-Ho]] has been promoting Debord's film. A DVD box set titled ''Guy Debord: Oeuvres cinématographiques complètes'' was released in 2005 and contains Debord's seven films.

==Music==
The piece used in the film is [http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/9/9e/IMSLP74228-PMLP148883-Corrette_Délices.pdf#page=22 ''Les Delices de la Solitude'', Op. 20 No. 6] - Sonata in D Major : I. ''Allegro Moderato'', by [[Michel Corrette]].

'''''The Stoning of Saint Stephen''''' is the first signed painting by Dutch artist [[Rembrandt]], painted in 1625 at the age of 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rembrandt |first=Emmanuel |last=Starcky |publisher=Hazan |year=1990 |page=45 |isbn=2-85025-212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently kept in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].

[[File:Rembrandt's Stoning of Saint Stephen (detail).jpg|thumb|left|There are at least three self-portraits found in the painting.]]
This work is inspired by the martyrdom of [[Saint Stephen]] which is recounted in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 7. This young deacon in the Christian community of Jerusalem was sentenced to death by stoning. The painting was influenced by the art of [[Caravaggio]] and [[Adam Elsheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rembrandt ou la lumière réinventée |author=Françoise Caillet-Mangin |date=28 March 2006  |url=http://www.convivialiteenflandre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=167
|publisher=Convivialité en Flandre |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the moment when Stephen was stoned outside the city by his many tormentors (about twenty characters), and he utters his last words to Christ as the light around him shows that the heavens are open.&lt;ref name="MBA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Harmensz van Rijn Rembrandt (Leyde, 1606 - Amsterdam, 1669), ''La Lapidation de Saint Etienne'' |url=http://www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/oeuvres-peintures/xviie_siecle/la_lapidation_de_sai?from_url=http%3A//www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/departement4598&amp;b_start:int=22&amp;startingReq=/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/oeuvres-peintures/#res_recherche |publisher=Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174748/http://www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/oeuvres-peintures/xviie_siecle/la_lapidation_de_sai?from_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mba-lyon.fr%2Fmba%2Fsections%2Ffr%2Fcollections-musee%2Fpeintures%2Fdepartement4598&amp;b_start%3Aint=22&amp;startingReq=%2Fsections%2Ffr%2Fcollections-musee%2Fpeintures%2Foeuvres-peintures%2F#res_recherche |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is divided into two distinct zones with a diagonal creating an effect of [[chiaroscuro]]: on the left, a man on horseback is in the shadow, and on the right, Stephen and his persecutors are in the light. Saul of Tarsus can be seen seated in the background holding in his lap the coats of the stoners. Some inaccuracies in the drawing can be seen.&lt;ref name="MBA"/&gt; The character behind Stephen seems to be a self-portrait done into a wider composition, as Spanish painter [[Diego Velázquez]] did in ''[[Las Meninas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rembrandt : 400 ans et toujours jeune ! |author=Karel Vereycken |date=13 December 2006 |url=http://www.solidariteetprogres.org/article2547.html |publisher=Solidarité et Progrès |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Durham suggests that Rembrandt "presents himself as a somewhat alarmed presence, a participant who may be having second thoughts about what was taking place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Durham |first=John I. |authorlink= |title=Biblical Rembrandt: Human Painter In A Landscape Of Faith |publisher=[[Mercer University Press]] |year=2004 |location=Macon |page=60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1V_saJPmlUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |id= |isbn=0865548862}}&lt;/ref&gt;
