      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Adaptability''' ({{lang-la|adaptō}} "fit to, adjust") is a feature of a system or of a process. This word has been put to use as a specialised term in different disciplines and in business operations. Word definitions of adaptability as a specialised term differ little from [[wikt:adaptability|dictionary definitions]]. According to Andresen and Gronau&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K., Gronau, N.: An Approach to Increase Adaptability in ERP Systems. In: Managing Modern Organizations with Information Technology : Proceedings of the 2005 Information Resources Management Association International Conference, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; adaptability in the field of organizational management can in general be seen as an ability to change something or oneself to fit to occurring changes. In ecology, adaptability has been described as the ability to cope with unexpected disturbances in the environment. 

With respect to business and manufacturing systems and processes, adaptability has come to be seen increasingly as an important factor for their efficiency and economic success. In contrast, adaptability and efficiency are held to be in opposition to each other in biological and ecological systems, requiring a trade-off, since both are important factors in the success of such systems.&lt;ref name="Conrad, Michael 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Conrad, Michael |title=Adaptability, the Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRXaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Adaptability+the+Significance+of+Variability+from+Molecule+to+Ecosystem+Plenum+Press+New+York+1983+Conrad+Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the adaptability of a process or a system, it should be validated concerning some criteria.

==Development of the use of this term==
In the life sciences the term adaptability is used variously.  At one end of the spectrum, the ordinary meaning of the word suffices for understanding.  At the other end, there is the term as introduced by Conrad,&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, M. 1972.  Statistical and Hierarchical Aspects of Biological Organization.  pp. 189-220 in Towards a Theoretical Biology, Vol. 4, ed. by [[C. H. Waddington]], Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a particular [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] measure of the biota of an ecosystem, or of any subsystem of the biota, such as a population of a single species, a single individual, cell, protein or gene.

In the technical research field this feature has been considered only since the late 1990s. H. P. Wiendahl first introduced adaptability as a necessary feature of a [[Manufacturing Execution Systems|manufacturing system]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Wiendahl, H.-P.; Hernández, R.; Scheffczyk, H. (1999): Die Wandlungsfähige Fabrik – Ansätze und Lösungen, Tagungsband zur Fachkonferenz, Frankfurt am Main, 26. und 27. April (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The need to consider adaptability arose in the context of factory planning, where it is an objective to develop modular, adaptable systems.  It has now become an important consideration for manufacturing and system engineers.

==Adaptability of a system==
{{details|Adaptation (computer science)}}
Adaptability is to be understood here as the ability of a [[system]] (e.g. a [[computer system]]) to adapt itself efficiently and fast to changed circumstances. An [[adaptive system]] is therefore an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] that is able to fit its behaviour according to changes in its environment or in parts of the system itself. That is why a requirement to recognize the demand for change without any other factors involved can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K., Gronau, N.: An Approach to Increase Adaptability in ERP Systems. In: Managing Modern Organizations with Information Technology: Proceedings of the 2005 Information Resources Management Association International Conference, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K.: Design and Use Patterns of Adaptability in Enterprise Systems, Gito, Berlin; 2006; S. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Antony Jerningham Murray''' was an honorary adviser to the [[Barbados|Barbadian]] Government on matters relating to [[sugar]] and trade. He was the eldest son of Captain John Jock Challenger Murray and his wife, Cecilia (née [[Jerningham]]), and also grandson of  [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]], the oceanographer.  For his services to Barbados and the Barbadian Government he was recognised in [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]’s Honours fourteen years after its independence, being appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the 1980 New Year Honours, and later in the April 1987 Birthday Honours, a knighthood.

Murray was educated at [[Eton College]] and went up to [[Oxford University]].  After a year there, war was declared and he joined the [[Grenadier Guards]], serving in the 1st and later the 4th Battalion, of which, like his father-in-law, Sir Alec Hardinge, he became adjutant. He served in Europe, in locations from Normandy to the Baltic, and retired with the rank of major.

After the war, Antony worked in the family business, a successful [[phosphate]] [[mining]] company on [[Christmas Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], founded by Antony's paternal grandfather, Sir John Murray.

Murray later moved his interests to Barbados. The family had been left the Kendal [[sugar plantation]], one of the oldest and largest on the island. He went on to serve as chairman of the West India Committee, a trade body, between 1963 and 1965, and subsequently as vice-president, and he was appointed an honorary Trade Commissioner by the Barbadian government. This involved him in intricate discussions with the [[EEC]], and he spent some time in [[Brussels]], focusing on the details of complex sugar trade agreements.

In Barbados, Murray helped to establish the Errol Barrow Memorial Trust, which provided scholarships for West Indian students seeking education overseas. He also was responsible for arranging the annual cricket match between his local village team and the Barbadian High Commission.

Basically, the idea... Suroosh Alvi:The concept... of what ... &lt;br/&gt;Naeem Afridi:of heroin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[September 11 attacks]] he was seen as an ally to the US attacks against the [[Taliban]]. He has also been approached by United States as a part of their efforts to exert [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|control over Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="atimes_2001"/&gt;

==Early life==

Afridi grew up in the [[Landi Kotal]], the principal city located in [[Khyber Pass]], [[Khyber Agency]]. He was an ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] belonging to the [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi tribe of Zakha Khel]].  He started life as a truck driver but quickly used his transportation connections to make a small fortune smuggling gold.  In the 1980s he forged close ties with Pakistan's military led by general [[Zia ul-Haq]].&lt;ref name="forbes.com.1997"&gt;{{cite web |date= 16 October 1997|url = https://www.forbes.com/1997/10/16/feat_side1.html|title = The rise and fall of a drug lord|publisher = [[Forbes]].com| accessdate = 14 July 2009 | last=Richard McGill Murphy |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayub Afridi died in November 2009 in his 70s. He is buried in the Ayub Afridi Kalay, Landi Kotal.

==Involvement in the Soviet war in Afghanistan==

Afridi was a key player in the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. In close collaboration with the [[CIA]], he was able to supplement huge amounts of money for the [[Mujahideen]] in Afghanistan through his growing of poppies to supply the [[heroin trade]].&lt;ref name="atimes_2001"/&gt; Using his smuggling network to move weapons supplied by the CIA to the mujahidin rebels fighting inside Afghanistan.  Afridi used the same channels to move [[Afghan opium]] to secret laboratories in Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].&lt;ref name="forbes.com.1997"/&gt; Afridi was elected as a Member of [[National Assembly, Pakistan]], in 1990. He contested the election as a free candidate from [[Khyber Agency]].

==1995 arrest==
In December 1995, the Americans were able to trick Afridi into leaving his sanctuary in Afghanistan and coming to Pakistan by promising him right of passage.  As soon as he touched down in Pakistan, he was arrested in connection with importing [[hashish]] into Belgium.&lt;ref name="khyber.org"/&gt; He served three years of his sentence before being shipped to Pakistan on 25 August 1999 after serving a three and a half-year sentence in a US prison and paying a 50,000-dollar fine.&lt;ref name="khyber.org"&gt;{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://www.khyber.org/people/a/Ayub_Afridi.shtml|title = Ayub Afridi|publisher = khyber.org| accessdate = 14 July 2009 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached where he would face another trial in Pakistan.  In Pakistan he was given a seven-year sentence for the same charge, importing hashish into Belgium.&lt;ref name="khyber.org"/&gt; He only served a few weeks of his sentence.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2003/09/sec-030917-rferl-160855.htm|title = Afghanistan/Pakistan: U.S. Indicts 11 In Connection With Drug Ring|publisher = Globalsecurity.org| accessdate = 14 July 2009 | last=Ron Synovitz |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his property at various posh areas in Pakistan was confiscated by the [[Government of Pakistan]]. As is the custom in with the Maliks of the area, in mid-eighties he built a well-fortified residence, known as Ayub Afridi Kalay (Ayub Afridi village), in Landi Kotal in [[Khyber Agency]].

==2001 release==

After the [[September 11 attacks]] he was freed from prison in Karachi after serving just a few weeks of a seven-year sentence for the export of 6.5 tons of hashish, seized at [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], in the 1980s. He had also been fined 4 million rupees (US$82,000). No reasons were given for Afridi's release, or under which legislation he was allowed to return to his home town in [[Khyber Agency]] in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].&lt;ref name="atimes_2001"/&gt;

==2005 legal trouble==

In 2005 Afridi was accused of international drug trafficking and ordered to appear before the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Pakistani Supreme Court]] on 17 November 2005 in an appeal challenging an order of the special appellate court against the forfeiture of his assets.  Afridi was sentenced by the Pakistani [[Anti-Narcotics Force]] (ANF) Court in a drug smuggling case and was declared absconder when he failed to appear before the court.&lt;ref name="dailytimes.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web |date= 17 November 2005|url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005\11\17\story_17-11-2005_pg7_29|title = Drug baron Ayub Afridi appears in SC today|format = |publisher = [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]| accessdate = 14 July 2009 | last=Staff report |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2006 the Supreme Court allowed the Anti Narcotics Force to confiscate a 100-room 'palace' and other properties worth Rs 167.8 million.&lt;ref name="dailytimes.com.pk.2006"&gt;{{cite web |date= 30 March 2006|url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\03\30\story_30-3-2006_pg7_3|title =Ayub Afridi's property seized|format = |publisher = [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]| accessdate = 14 July 2009 | last= Mohammad Kamran|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barcelona Synchrotron Park''' (BSP) is a 408-hectare (1.5 square mile) [[business park]] centered on the [[ALBA (synchrotron)|ALBA synchrotron]] that has been in operation since 2012. It is located on the northern outskirts of [[Barcelona]], at the heart of Àmbit B30, an industrial territory of about 30,000 companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/B30/mbitb30/2&lt;/ref&gt; The Park is a member of the Network of Science and Technology Parks of Catalonia (XPCAT).

BSP is flanked on one side by the Research Park at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (PRUAB) and the Vallès Technology Park (PTV). While roughly half of the Park is designated for high tech companies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catalonia.com/en/about-us/newsletter_news/newsletter/issue1/syncrotron.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; and both residential and commercial development, a full 189 hectares are devoted to green space. In October 2016, BSP was awarded the [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biodiversity/business/index_en.htm Business &amp; Biodiversity] label by the European Commission for its agenda in favour of protecting its biodiversity.

Locally known as Parc de l’Alba, BSP is a public consortium between the local city council of [[Cerdanyola del Vallès]] and the [[government of Catalonia]] through INCASÒL, the agency in charge of the management of public lands.

'''Bilikiss Adebiyi''' or '''Bilikiss Adebiyi Abiola''' is a [[Nigeria]]n CEO of a recycling company,  Wecyclers, in [[Lagos]]. She was educated at [[MIT]] and came to notice due to a novel approach to recycling based on tricycles and [[SMS]].

==Early life==
Adebiyi was born in [[Lagos]] where she went to the Supreme Education Foundation secondary school. She entered the [[University of Lagos]], but she left the University of Lagos after a year to complete her studies in America.&lt;ref name=ngr/&gt; She graduated from [[Fisk University]] and then went to [[Vanderbilt University]] where she earned a master's degree. She worked for [[IBM]] for five years before deciding to study further. She was accepted to study for a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref name=huff/&gt;

[[File:Young CEO - Bilikiss Adebiyi.webm|thumb|left|Bilikiss Adebiyi Abiola on NdaniTV]]
MIT is where She first came up with the idea for a recycling business&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; during her second year at MIT, where she was studying waste as her specialist subject. Her initial idea was to increase the quantity of waste she could collect from households by offering them raffle tickets in exchange. When she discussed this in Nigeria on a vacation she was surprised at the enthusiasm that was offered for her ideas.&lt;ref name=ngr/&gt; Waste is a particular nuisance in Lagos as only a small percentage is collected regularly.&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt; Adebiyi took the idea back to MIT where she was able to gather support by entering her idea in competitions. Adebiyi's husband had always been based in Nigeria so there was a good reason for her to return to Lagos, after her 2012 graduation.&lt;ref name=ngr/&gt; Whilst her children were at school she commuted each day to establish her new recycling business that she called ''Wecyclers''.&lt;ref name=ngr&gt;[http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/08/adebiyi-abiola-new-face-of-waste-management-in-nigeria/ Adebiyi-Abiola: New Face Of Waste Management In Nigeria], NGRGuardian, Retrieved 28 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; When the business started Adebiyi would take out a tricycle to do collections to find out more about her new business.&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cpFcRtbXVI Young CEO – Bilikiss Adebiyi], NDaniTV, Retrieved 29 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wecyclers==
[[File:Bilikiss Adebiyi's wecycler.png|thumb|left|A Wecycler's tricycle – A "Wecycle"]]
[[File:Wecycle rubbish in Lagos for recycling.png|thumb|Wecycle rubbish being recycled]]
In 2012 she co-founded a company called ''Wecyclers'' which collects recyclable rubbish from households in Lagos. Once the rubbish is sorted then her company sends back SMS messages to the person who supplied the rubbish.&lt;ref name=lagos/&gt; The SMS message tells that person about points they have earned from the rubbish they donated. The company works in partnership with the Lagos Waste Management Authority. Lagos produces 9,000 tonnes of waste per day and the authority were trying to almost double the proportion that was recycled from the 18% figure in 2011.&lt;ref name=lagos&gt;[http://waste-management-world.com/a/recycling-banks-to-reduce-scavenging-at-dumps-in-lagos-nigeria Recycling Banks to Reduce Scavenging at Dumps in Lagos, Nigeria], January 2011, waste-management-world.com, Retrieved 28 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria is Africa's biggest economy but the disorganisation in Lagos means that rubbish cannot always be collected. Wecyclers use modified tricycles which enables rubbish to be collected where normal vehicles could not go.&lt;ref name=guard /&gt; Wecyclers collects from thousands of households. The company estimated in October 2015 that it has collected over 500 tons of rubbish, it has created value from that rubbish and it has employed 80 people.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/21/money-lying-streets-meet-woman-transforming-recycling-lagos-wecyclers 'It's money lying in the streets': Meet the woman transforming recycling in Lagos], Athlyn Cathcart-Keays, 21 October 2015, ''The Guardian'', Retrieved 28 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Adebiyi whose married name is Abiola has arranged for the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] to subsidise their operation. Wecyclers had found that a significant proportion of the rubbish came from these companies and they were willing to assist with the recycling effort.&lt;ref name=cartier&gt;[http://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/candidate/bilikiss-adebiyi-Abiola Bilikiss Adebiyi], 2013, cartierwomensinitiative.com, Retrieved 29 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Adebiyi's efforts have been reported in Nigeria, the UK, US and Germany in 2014 and 2016. Coverage included CNN, ''Huffington Post'', "Die Zeit", ''The Independent'', ''[[Marie Claire|Marie Claire Magazine]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', NDaniTV and D+C&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/wecyclers-help-tackle-garbage-challenge-lagos-nigeria|title = "Incentives for behaviour change"|date = 24 May 2016|accessdate = 7 July 2016|publisher = D+C, development and cooperation|author = Eva-Maria Verfürth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chimney Smoke Stack.jpg|thumb||390px|right|A vertical chimney erected on the mechanical penthouse of a residential high rise in Ontario, Canada for ejecting combustion products from the building's water boiler.]]
[[Image:GRES-2 wide.jpg|thumb|150px|The world's tallest chimney, of the [[Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station|GRES-2]] power plant in [[Ekibastuz]], [[Kazakhstan]], stands 419.7 m (1,377 ft) tall.]][[File:Natural Chimneys - House Chimney 2.jpg|thumb|150px|A chimney remaining after the destruction of a 19th-century two-story house ([[Mount Solon, Virginia]]).]]
A '''chimney''' is a structure that provides ventilation for hot [[flue gas]]es or [[smoke]] from a [[boiler]], [[stove]], [[furnace]] or [[fireplace]] to the outside [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the [[combustion]] in what is known as the [[stack effect|stack, or chimney effect]]. The space inside a chimney is called a ''[[flue]]''. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the [[United States]], the term '''''smokestack''''' (colloquially, '''''stack''''') is also used when referring to [[Chimney (locomotive)|locomotive chimneys]] or [[Funnel (ship)|ship chimneys]], and the term '''''funnel''''' can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/signatures/24h.htm C.F. Saunders (1923), ''The Southern Sierras of California'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literature.org/authors/verne-jules/eighty/chapter-26.html Jules Verne (1872), ''Around the World in Eighty Days'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of a chimney influences its ability to transfer flue gases to the external environment via stack effect. Additionally, the dispersion of pollutants at higher altitudes can reduce their impact on the immediate surroundings. In the case of chemically aggressive output, a sufficiently tall chimney can allow for partial or complete self-neutralization of airborne chemicals before they reach ground level. The dispersion of pollutants over a greater area can reduce their concentrations and facilitate compliance with regulatory limits.

[[Image:Seagull sits on top of the chimney cone at The World of Glass.jpg|thumb|right|Seagull sits on top of a hot gas cooling chimney at The World of Glass [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] UK.]]

[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used tubes inside the walls to draw smoke out of bakeries but chimneys only appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. The earliest extant example of an English chimney is at the keep of [[Conisbrough Castle]] in [[Yorkshire]], which dates from 1185 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co.) 1978/1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not become common in houses until the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Sparrow, Walter Shaw. ''The English house: how to judge its periods and styles''. London: Eveleigh Nash, 1908. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Smoke hoods'' were an early method of collecting the smoke into a chimney (see image). Another step in the development of chimneys was the use of built in ovens which allowed the household to bake at home. Industrial chimneys became common in the late 18th century.

Chimneys in ordinary dwellings were first built of wood and plaster or mud. Since then chimneys have traditionally been built of brick or stone, both in small and large buildings. Early chimneys were of a simple brick construction. Later chimneys were constructed by placing the bricks around tile liners. To control downdrafts, venting caps (often called ''chimney pots'') with a variety of designs are sometimes placed on the top of chimneys. 

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the methods used to extract [[lead]] from its ore produced large amounts of toxic fumes. In the north of England, long near-horizontal chimneys were built, often more than 3&amp;nbsp;km (2&amp;nbsp;mi) long, which typically terminated in a short vertical chimney in a remote location where the fumes would cause less harm. Lead and silver deposits formed on the inside of these long chimneys, and periodically workers would be sent along the chimneys to scrape off these valuable deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Mining|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/mining/lead/|work=The Northern Echo|publisher=Newsquest Media Group|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Seven-flue_Stack_1834.png|thumb|upright|left|A section of a large late Georgian four storey house, showing the advantage of using a mechanical sweeper over [[Chimney sweep|climbing boys]]]]
As a result of the limited ability to handle transverse loads with brick, chimneys in houses were often built in a "stack", with a fireplace on each floor of the house sharing a single chimney, often with such a stack at the front and back of the house. Today's [[central heating]] systems have made chimney placement less critical, and the use of non-structural gas vent pipe allows a flue gas conduit to be installed around obstructions and through walls.

In fact, most modern high-efficiency heating appliances do not require a chimney. Such appliances are generally installed near an external wall, and a noncombustible wall thimble allows a [[flue|vent pipe]] to run directly through the external wall.

On a pitched roof where a chimney penetrates a roof, [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] is used to seal up the joints. The down-slope piece is called an apron, the sides receive step flashing and a [[Cricket (roofing)|cricket]] is used to divert water around the upper side of the chimney underneath the flashing.&lt;ref&gt;Roofing, flashing &amp; waterproofing. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 43-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thornbury.chimney.detail.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Carved brick chimneys characteristic of late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] buildings, at [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire|Thornbury Castle]], 1514]]

[[Industrial chimney]]s are commonly referred to as [[flue gas stacks]] and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced [[concrete]] has almost entirely replaced brick as a [[structural]] component in the construction of industrial chimneys. [[Refractory]] bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete [[windshield]] with a number of flues on the inside.

The {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} chimney at ''[[Sasol]] Three'' consists of a 26 m (85 ft) diameter windshield with four 4.6 metre diameter concrete flues which are lined with refractory bricks built on rings of [[corbel]]s spaced at 10 metre intervals. The reinforced concrete can be cast by conventional formwork or sliding formwork. The height is to ensure the pollutants are dispersed over a wider area to meet legal or other safety requirements.

==Residential flue liners==
&lt;!--flue liner redirectys here--&gt;
[[File:ChimneyProvidenceProspectPark.jpg|thumb|upright|A chimney with two clay-tile flue liners]]
A flue liner is a secondary barrier in a chimney that protects the masonry from the acidic products of combustion, helps prevent [[flue gas]] from entering the house, and reduces the size of an oversized flue. Since the 1950s, building codes in many locations require newly built chimneys to have a flue liner. Chimneys built without a liner can usually have a liner added, but the type of liner needs to match the type of appliance it services. Flue liners may be clay or concrete tile, metal, or poured in place concrete.

Clay tile flue liners are very common in the United States, although it is the only liner which does not meet [[Underwriters Laboratories]] 1777 approval and frequently they have problems such as cracked tiles and improper installation.&lt;ref name="Bliss" &gt;Bliss, Stephen, ed.. ''Troubleshooting guide to residential construction: the diagnosis and prevention of common building problems''. Richmond, VT: Builderburg Group, 1997. 197. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Clay tiles are usually about {{convert|2|ft|m}} long, available in various sizes and shapes, and are installed in new construction as the chimney is built. A [[refractory cement]] is used between each tile.

Metal liners may be stainless steel, aluminum, or galvanized iron and may be flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with [[firewood]], wood [[pellet fuel]], and non-condensing [[Heating oil|oil]] appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully.&lt;ref name="Bliss"/&gt; Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. 

Concrete flue liners are like clay liners but are made of a refractory cement and are more durable than the clay liners.

Poured in place concrete liners are made by pouring special concrete into the existing chimney with a form. These liners are highly durable, work with any heating appliance, and can reinforce a weak chimney, but they are irreversible.

==Chimney pots, caps and tops==
[[File:Clovelly (Devon, UK) -- 2013 -- 1349.jpg|thumb|right|Rows of chimney pots in an English town, 2013.]]
A chimney pot is placed on top of the chimney to expand the length of the chimney inexpensively, and to improve the chimney's [[Draft (boiler)|draft]].  A chimney with more than one pot on it indicates that multiple fireplaces on different floors share the chimney.

A [[cowl (chimney)|cowl]] is placed on top of the chimney to prevent birds and other animals from nesting in the chimney.  They often feature a rain guard to prevent rain or snow from going down the chimney.  A metal wire mesh is often used as a [[spark arrestor]] to minimize burning debris from rising out of the chimney and making it onto the roof. Although the masonry inside the chimney can absorb a large amount of moisture which later evaporates, rainwater can collect at the base of the chimney. Sometimes weep holes are placed at the bottom of the chimney to drain out collected water.

A chimney cowl or wind directional cap is a helmet-shaped chimney cap that rotates to align with the wind and prevent a backdraft of smoke and wind down the chimney.

[[Image:H-style cap.jpg|thumb|upright|A H-style cowl]]

An ''H-style cap'' (cowl) is a chimney top constructed from chimney pipes shaped like the letter H. (Its image is included in [[cowl (chimney)]].) It is an age-old method of regulating draft in situations where prevailing winds or turbulences cause downdraft and backpuffing. Although the H cap has a distinct advantage over most other downdraft caps, it fell out of favor because of its bulky design. It is found mostly in marine use but has been regaining popularity due to its energy-saving functionality.  The H-cap stabilizes the draft rather than increasing it. Other downdraft caps are based on the [[Venturi effect]], solving downdraft problems by increasing the updraft constantly resulting in much higher fuel consumption.

A chimney damper is a metal plate that can be positioned to close off the chimney when not in use and prevent outside air from entering the interior space, and can be opened to permit hot gases to exhaust when a fire is burning.  A ''top damper'' or ''cap damper'' is a metal spring door placed at the top of the chimney with a long metal chain that allows one to open and close the damper from the fireplace.  A ''throat damper'' is a metal plate at the base of the chimney, just above the firebox, that can be opened and closed by a lever, gear, or chain to seal off the fireplace from the chimney.  The advantage of a top damper is the tight weatherproof seal that it provides when closed, which prevents cold outside air from flowing down the chimney and into the living space—a feature that can rarely be matched by the metal-on-metal seal afforded by a throat damper.  Additionally, because the throat damper is subjected to intense heat from the fire directly below, it is common for the metal to become warped over time, thus further degrading the ability of the throat damper to seal.  However, the advantage of a throat damper is that it seals off the living space from the air mass in the chimney, which, especially for chimneys positioned on an outside of wall of the home, is generally very cold.  It is possible in practice to use both a top damper and a throat damper to obtain the benefits of both.  The two top damper designs currently on the market are the Lyemance (pivoting door) and the Lock Top (translating door).

In the late [[Middle Ages]] in [[Western Europe]] the design of [[crow-stepped gable]]s arose to allow maintenance access to the chimney top, especially for tall structures such as [[castle]]s and great [[manor house]]s.

==Chimney draught or draft==
[[Image:Chimney effect.svg|thumb|150px|The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure.]]
{{main|Flue gas stack}}

When coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or any other fuel is combusted in a stove, oven, fireplace, hot water boiler, or industrial furnace, the hot combustion product gases that are formed are called flue gases. Those gases are generally exhausted to the ambient outside air through chimneys or industrial flue gas stacks (sometimes referred to as smokestacks).

The combustion flue gases inside the chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less [[density|dense]] than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower [[pressure]] than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called "natural draught/draft", [[HVAC#Natural ventilation|"natural ventilation"]], "chimney effect", or "[[stack effect]]". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney.  This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause [[creosote]] to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural  draft involves a number of design factors, many of which require iterative trial-and-error methods.

As a "first guess" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the natural draught/draft flow rate by assuming that the [[molecular mass]] (i.e., molecular weight) of the flue gas and the external air are equal and that the frictional pressure and heat losses are negligible:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C\; A\; \sqrt {2\;g\;H\;\frac{T_i - T_e}{T_e}}&lt;/math&gt;
{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| ''Q''
|align=left|= chimney draught/draft flow rate, m³/s 
|-
!align=right| ''A''
|align=left|= cross-sectional area of chimney, m² (assuming it has a constant cross-section)

Combining two flows into chimney: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;+''A''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;''A'',
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=7.1 inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the minimum required flow area from water heater tank and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;=19.6&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the minimum flow area from a furnace of a central heating system.

==Draft hood==
Gas fired appliances must have a draft hood to cool combustion products entering the chimney and prevent updrafts or downdrafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Field Installation of Draft Hoods |date=2009 |publisher=A.O.

==Maintenance and problems==
[[File:New Zealand Parliamentary Library Chimneys.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Chimneys on the Parliamentary Library in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]
A characteristic problem of chimneys is they develop deposits of [[creosote]] on the walls of the structure when used with wood as a [[fuel]]. Deposits of this substance can interfere with the airflow and more importantly, they are [[combustible]] and can cause dangerous [[chimney fire]]s if the deposits ignite in the chimney.

Heaters that burn natural gas drastically reduce the amount of creosote buildup due to natural gas burning much cleaner and more efficiently than traditional solid fuels. While in most cases there is no need to clean a gas chimney on an annual basis that does not mean that other parts of the chimney cannot fall into disrepair. Disconnected or loose chimney fittings caused by corrosion over time can pose serious dangers for residents due to leakage of carbon monoxide into the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charmedchimney.com/chimney-service-faqs.php Chimney Problems and Warnings Signs]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is recommended—and in some countries even mandatory—that chimneys be inspected annually and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent these problems. The workers who perform this task are called [[chimney sweep]]s or [[Steeplejack|steeplejacks]]. This work used to be done largely by [[child labour]], and [[Chimney_sweep#Literature|as such]] features in [[Victorian literature]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] in some parts of Europe, a [[crow-stepped gable]] design was developed, partly to provide access to chimneys without use of ladders.

[[File:Chernobylreactor 1.jpg|thumb|Iconic non-operational chimney of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl reactor #4]], preserved as part of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|Chernobyl sarcophagus]].]]

Masonry (brick) chimneys have also proven to be particularly prone to crumbling during an [[earthquake]]. Government housing authorities in cities prone to earthquakes such as [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] now recommend building new homes with stud-framed chimneys around a metal flue. Bracing or strapping old masonry chimneys has not proven to be very effective in preventing damage or injury from earthquakes. It is now possible to buy "faux-brick" facades to cover these modern chimney structures.

Other potential problems include:
* "[[spall]]ing" brick, in which moisture seeps into the brick and then freezes, cracking and flaking the brick and loosening mortar seals.
* shifting foundations, which may degrade integrity of chimney masonry
* nesting or infestation by unwanted animals such as squirrels, racoons, or [[chimney swift]]s
* chimney leaks
* drafting issues, which may allow smoke inside building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chimney Airflow Problems|url=http://www.highschimney.com/articles/chimney-airflow-problems/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* issues with fireplace or heating appliance may cause unwanted degradation or hazards to chimney

==Dual-use chimneys==
Some very high chimneys are used for carrying antennas of [[mobile phone]] services and low power [[FM broadcasting|FM]]/[[TV]]-transmitters. Special attention must be paid to possible [[corrosion]] problems if these antennas are near the exhaust of the chimney.

In some cases the chimneys of power stations are used also as [[Electricity pylon|pylons]]. However this type of construction, which is used at several power stations in the former Soviet Union, is not very common, because of corrosion problems of conductor cables.

The [[Dům Dětí a Mládeže v Modřanech]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] is equipped with an observation deck.

The chimney of [[Pei Tou Incinerator]] carries a revolving restaurant.

===Cooling tower used as an industrial chimney===
At some power stations, which are equipped with plants for the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], it is possible to use the [[cooling tower]] as a chimney. Such cooling towers can be seen in Germany at the [[Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg]] and at the [[Power Station Rostock]]. At power stations that are not equipped for removing sulfur dioxide, such usage of cooling towers could result in serious corrosion problems which are not easy to prevent.

'''Commercial International Bank (Egypt) S.A.E.''' is an [[Egypt]]ian private-sector bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian bank plans to expand via partners|last=Kasse|first=Mahmoud|date=2006-08-21|publisher=''International Herald Tribune''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/COMI:EY |title=COMI:EGX Stock Quote - Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE - Bloomberg|work=bloomberg.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company corporate headquarters are located in [[Cairo, Egypt]]. The bank serves more than 500,000 clients and has more than 6,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cibeg.com/English/InvestorRelations/Pages/Fast-facts.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is ranked in the Forbes Global 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/companies/commercial-international-bank/}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing which represents the largest corporations in the world. Currently, there are only two Egyptian companies making the list.

== History ==

Commercial International Bank was established in 1975 as a joint venture between the [[National Bank of Egypt]] (51%) and the Chase Manhattan Bank (49%) under the name "Chase National Bank of Egypt”. Mr. Ali Dabbous was Chase National Bank’s first Chairman, serving from 1975 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://annualreport2015.cibeg.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Following Chase's decision to divest its equity stake in 1987, National Bank of Egypt (NBE) increased its shareholding to 99.9%, and the Bank changed its name to Commercial International Bank (Egypt) S.A.E. NBE’s stake gradually decreased through several public offerings till it reached 18.7%. In 2006, a Consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings acquired the NBE stake. In July 2009, Actis a leading emerging markets private equity firm, invested US$244 million to acquire shares in CIB. Hence, Actis acquired 50% of the stake held by the Consortium led by Ripplewood Holdings. Five months later, Ripplewood sold its remaining position of 4.7% in CIB through the open market. This move marked the successful transition of strategic partnership to be with Actis, who then became the largest shareholder in CIB with a 9.1% stake. In March 2014, Actis sold a portion of its holding in CIB, representing 2.6% of the Bank’s total outstanding shares, in the open market to a group of international investors. Later in the year, Actis, has successfully released its investment in Commercial International Bank (CIB) and has sold its remaining 6.5% to Subsidiaries wholly owned by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (“Fairfax”) in May 2014.

==CI Capital==

'''CI Capital''' is the investment banking arm of the Commercial Internationational Bank (CIB) with corporate headquarters in Cairo. It is one of the largest investments banks in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In 2015, Global Finance Magazine ranked CI Capital as the best Investment Bank in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gfmag.com/media/press-releasess/global-finance-names-worlds-best-investment-banks-2015?page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investment bank serves a range of clients including governments, corporations, financial institutions, high-net-worth individuals and retail customers.

CI Capital has the following four divisions:

'''Dorset Green Technology Park''' (formerly '''Winfrith Technology Centre''') is a science and technology park which is owned by the [[Homes and Communities Agency]]. The site was the former [[UKAEA]] [[Winfrith|Winfrith Atomic Energy Establishment]] which was in service from the 1950s to early 1990s. The [[Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor]] was also developed at the site.

The centre is situated near the village of [[Winfrith Newburgh]], which is some eight miles west of [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and nine miles east of Dorchester. 

==History==
===Winfrith Technology Centre===
Winfrith Technology Centre dates from the 1980s when part of the [[UKAEA]] site was already being referred to by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Winfrith Technology Centre |journal=Engineering World |publisher= Society of Engineers Limited |date=1989 |volume=80-83 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a research and development centre in support of the nuclear, oil and gas industries.

By the early 21st century, under the ownership of UKAEA, the centre was home to about 50 companies including defence technology company [[QinetiQ]] which operated its underwater technology business there.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3669631.stm |title=UK atomic shutdown 30 years early|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2004|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="did1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/QinetiQ-Sells-Underwater-Systems-Division-to-Atlas-05423/|title=QinetiQ Sells Underwater Systems Division to Atlas|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|date=May 17, 2009|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; QinetiQ would later sell its underwater technology  division to [[Atlas Elektronik]] in 2009,&lt;ref name="did1"/&gt; whilst still remaining a tenant at Winfrith.&lt;ref name="de1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/11755997.26_000_jobs_bonanza_to_follow___12_6_million_government_investment_in_county/?ref=mr|title=26,000 jobs bonanza to follow £12.6 million government investment in county|publisher=Dorset Echo|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Winfrith Technology Centre was sold to the UK government's regeneration agency, [[English Partnerships]] for £7.54 million.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt; English Partnerships' ownership passed to its successor body, the [[Homes and Communities Agency]], in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/story.aspx?storycode=6502107|title=Inside Housing: New agencies will face 'huge challenges|publisher=Inside Housing|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=3 February 2015}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dorset Green Technology Park===
In early 2008 English Partnerships appointed Zog Brownfield Ventures to redevelop the Technology Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.building.co.uk/ep-appoints-zog-and-hbos-to-redevelop-atomic-centre/3107119.article|title=EP appoints Zog and HBOS to redevelop atomic centre|publisher=Building.co.u|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was "to create an eco-friendly business complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/1965511.zerocarbon_plans_at_former_nuclear_site/|title=Zero-carbon plans at former nuclear site|publisher=Dorset Echo|date=15 January 2008|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 the site was being called the Dorset Green Technology Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/9092082.Ideas_appeal_for_ex_nuclear_site_in_Winfrith/|title=The Dorset Green Technology Park |publisher=Dorset Echo|date=19 June 2011|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently major plans to expand and redevelop the site.&lt;ref name="de1"/&gt;

'''Downtown Fort William''', also known as '''Downtown Thunder Bay South''' or '''the South Core''', is the urban core of the former city of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], the southern half of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]]. It is centred on Victoriaville Civic Centre, an indoor [[shopping mall]] and [[civic centre]] built as part of an [[urban renewal]] project in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Page234"&gt;Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others. (1995). ''[http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/publications.htm Thunder Bay: From Rivalry to Unity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207031852/http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/publications.htm |date=February 7, 2012 }}''. [[Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society]], pp 234. {{ISBN|0-920119-22-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is separated from the [[Kaministiquia River]] by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line, and its topography is relatively flat.

Downtown Fort William is the location of [[Thunder Bay City Hall]], and numerous other government offices.

==History==

Downtown Fort William is one of the three nodes around which urban growth began in the Lakehead area. In 1883 the [[Canadian government]] transferred responsibility for the [[Transcontinental railroad#Canada|Transcontinental railway]] to the private [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which subsequently relocated the Lake Superior terminus from the Fort William Town Plot (West Fort William) to the lower Kaministiquia River, seven kilometres downstream from [[Westfort]]. Growth began at the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Simpson Street, because the McVicar family had negotiated an agreement with the CPR to place the railway station on the McVicar patent, and because the CPR had erected its second and third Thunder Bay grain elevators (CPR Elevators A &amp; B) at the foot of Victoria Avenue in 1884/85 and 1888. In 1891 the Municipality of Neebing acquired land from the McKellar family and began construction of a town hall on Donald Street &lt;ref&gt;Fort William Journal 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 26 Sept 1891&lt;/ref&gt; which, when Fort William was incorporated in 1892, became the town hall of Fort William.&lt;ref name="Page57"&gt;Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others. (1995). ''[http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/publications.htm Thunder Bay: From Rivalry to Unity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207031852/http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/publications.htm |date=February 7, 2012 }}''. [[Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society]], pp 57. {{ISBN|0-920119-22-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and due to [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]'s lack of a city hall, became the location of [[Thunder Bay City Hall]] after the [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of the two cities in 1970.

==Demographics==

[[Image:Paterson Court Thunder Bay.jpg|thumb|Paterson Court]]

The downtown area has a population of approximately 1,000 and a median age of approximately 47 years. The south core has a larger aboriginal population than much of the rest of the city, and the lowest average income in Thunder Bay.&lt;ref name="Statscan"&gt;[[Statistics Canada]]. Profile of Census Tract 5950006.00, Thunder Bay, Ontario. [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]]. Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 92-597-XWE. Ottawa. Released December 4, 2007. Retrieved March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Income"&gt;Income statistics: [http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/1176.pdf Shopping in Thunder Bay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007151355/http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/1176.pdf |date=October 7, 2006 }}, pp. 5. Retrieved March 1. 2008. Statistics Canada income data for 2006 will be released on May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The south core is the location of several apartment buildings aimed to low income individuals and seniors. It also has a relatively large homeless contingent and is the location of the [[Homeless shelter|Rotary Shelter House]].&lt;ref name="Shelter House"&gt;[http://www.shelterhouse.on.ca/ Shelter House Thunder Bay].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[John Howard Society]], an organization dedicated to assist people who have come into conflict with the law, is located in the old [[YMCA]] building.&lt;ref name="John Howard"&gt;[http://www.johnhowardtbay.on.ca/ John Howard Society of Thunder Bay].&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime is recognized to be a problem in the south core, especially near the Brodie Street [[Bus station|bus terminal]]. [[Thunder Bay Police]] operates the McKellar Neighbourhood Policing Office across the street from the bus terminal and has cruisers drive by on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Thunder Bay Police"&gt;[[Thunder Bay Police Service]], [http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&amp;pg=2307 Neighbourhood Policing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006173127/http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&amp;pg=2307 |date=October 6, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

[[Image:Victoria Street Thunder Bay.jpg|thumb|Victoria Avenue East]]

Neither of Thunder Bay's downtown cores overshadowed the other, and both are today less important economically than the Intercity area. However, the South Core continues to be an employment centre. Several thousand people work in the core every day. The largest employers in the area include the [[Local government|city government]] of Thunder Bay, the StarTek [[Call centre|Call Centre]], and various businesses in the Victoriaville Civic Centre.&lt;ref name="Major employers"&gt;[http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/2284.pdf Major Employer List 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121416/http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/2284.pdf |date=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core is home to branches of four of Canada's five major banks, and several [[credit union]]s.

Several industrial businesses are located in the neighbourhood, primarily on the eastern side of the neighbourhood, and the Canadian Pacific [[Train station|Train Station]] is located in the southernmost part of the neighbourhood.

==Arts and culture==

Downtown Fort William is the location of many [[cultural institutions]]. The [[Thunder Bay Historical Museum]] occupies the renovated Fort William [[police station]] on Donald Street, one of the core's many historical landmarks. It is operated by the century-old Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society and has three floors of galleries, including a [[Prison cell|jail cell]] and recreation of a Fort William street from the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;[http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/ Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Also located off Donald Street is the Brodie Street Art Gallery, which showcases local artists and offers watercolour lessons by local painter Peter Humeniuk.&lt;ref name="Brodie St Gallery"&gt;[http://www.bigbrush.com Big Brush.com], website for the Brodie Street Art Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thunder Bay Public Library|Brodie Resource Library]] is located on Brodie Street beside city hall. It was opened in 1912 as Fort William's Carnegie Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbpl.ca/internal.asp?id=78&amp;cid=256 History of the Thunder Bay Public Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828223757/http://www.tbpl.ca/internal.asp?id=78&amp;cid=256 |date=August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s Thunder Bay studio is located on Miles Street on the former site of St Joseph's Convent. facing the former St Stanislaus school. It is the broadcasting centre for [[CBQ-FM|CBQ]] and [[CBQT-FM|CBQT]]. A [[webcam]] is mounted on top of its broadcasting antenna, and looks out over the Simpson-Ogden neighbourhood.

===Places of worship===

[[Image:St Andrews Presbyterian Church Thunder Bay.jpg|thumb|left|St. Andrews Presbyterian]]

Several churches are located in the core, the most prominent being St. Andrews [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], located at the corner of Brodie and Donald Streets. A city-designated heritage property, it was designed in 1909 by Stinson and Hood architects in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]]. It features a covered entrance supported by granite columns with floral capitals, a unique feature in Thunder Bay, and its [[bell tower]] dominates the area's skyline.&lt;ref name="St.Andrews Book"&gt;Blumenson, John J.

==Parks==

There are many parks and parkettes in the south core, the most notable is Paterson Park, located on the former site of the Fort William Central School on May Street between Miles and Leith streets. The park was named after Norman M. Paterson, a [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] and founder of [[Paterson GlobalFoods]]. The park features a fountain and benches on an artificial hill.&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;Tronrud, Thorold J. &amp; Nicholson, David (2005).

==Education==

[[Image:Fort William Collegiate Institute.jpg|thumb|Fort William Collegiate Institute]]

Many schools were located in the downtown area, but as the population aged and the number of families decreased, most were closed. The only school operating in the core today is McKellar Park Central School, which has classes from [[Kindergarten]] to grade 8 and was ranked by the [[Frasier Institute]] as the worst in Thunder Bay in 2008.&lt;ref name="McKellar Park School"&gt;"[http://www.tbsource.com/Localnews/index.asp?cid=104890 School boards respond to Fraser Institute ranking]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", TBSource.

== History of the ICTI Ethical Toy Program ==

Working conditions in Asian [[toy]] [[factory|factories]] in the 1990s were under intense scrutiny, most notably following the [[Kader Toy Factory Fire]] in [[Bangkok]] ([[Thailand]]), considered the worst industrial factory fire in history,&lt;ref name=WSWS&gt;{{cite news|last1=Symonds|first1=Peter|title=Thai toy factory fire: 10 years after the world’s worst industrial inferno|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2003/05/kade-m16.html|accessdate=16 Apr 2015|work=World Socialist Web Site|date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a toy factory fire in [[Shenzhen]] ([[China]]) in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/world/fire-ravages-a-doll-factory-in-southern-china-killing-81.html|title=Fire Ravages a Doll Factory In Southern China, Killing 81|date=20 November 1993|work=Reuters|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together caused more than 250 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pangelinan|first1=M A|title=Lives Lost to the Overseas Toy Industry: A Call for Action; in: Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review, 16(3), S. 735– 761|date=1994|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction to the tragedy, the Hong Kong Toy Coalition was established and published the "Charter on the Safe Production of Toys"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Pearson|author2=Gill Seyfang|author3=Rhys Jenkins|title=Corporate Responsibility and Labour Rights: Codes of Conduct in the Global Economy|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-1-1365-6890-9|page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 1990s. In this charter, the Hong Kong Toy Coalition demanded the improvement of labor, social, and safety standards in Chinese [[toy]] [[factory|factories]].

Following the production of the charter, larger toy brands and retailers started to create their own [[Code of Conduct|Codes of Conduct]]. [[Hasbro]] established its “Global Business Ethics Principles” in 1993, [[Zapf Creation]] a [[code of conduct]] in 1995, [[The Walt Disney Corporation]] its “International Labor Standards” in 1996, [[Mattel]] its “Global Manufacturing Principles” 1997, and [[LEGO]] created a [[code of conduct]] in 1997. It is estimated that there were up to 70 different standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biedermann | first = Reinhard | title = Sozialstandards durch private governance Zwei-Stufen-Kooperation in der globalen Spielzeugbranche | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-8452-0126-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made it difficult for toy factories to comply with varying standards and created significant amounts of duplication of [[audit]]ing in [[factory|factories]]. Therefore, an industry wide ethical manufacturing standard was called for in the toy industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) created the Code of Business Practices in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Likosky|first1=Michael|title=Transnational Legal Processes: Globalisation and Power Disparities|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-4069-4674-4|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 at the annual general meeting of ICTI, the member toy industry associations unanimously agreed to launch the ICTI CARE Process, a worldwide [[audit]]ing process to implement the ICTI Code of Business Practices, drive convergence, and reduce duplication of social [[audit]]ing in the global [[toy]] industry [[supply chain]].

In 2004, the ICTI CARE Foundation was created as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisation]] working completely independently of ICTI to oversee the ICTI CARE Process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Byrne | first = Christopher | title = They came to play : 100 years of the Toy Industry Association | publisher = Toy Industry Association | location = United States |pages=77| year = 2016 | isbn = 978-0-692-61707-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the organization became the ICTI Ethical Toy Program. Along with a new name, the next generation of the Ethical Toy Program was unveiled with an updated mission and strategy for the organization, a new membership model and a brand-new look and feel to deliver the changes.

== Ethical Toy Program Certification Program ==

Ethical Toy Program is the ethical [[manufacturing]] program specifically designed for the [[toy]] industry based on the ICTI Code of Business Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ICTI Code of Business Practices ===

The ICTI Code of Business Practices, upon which the Ethical Toy Program is based, covers nine core principals:
* [[Working time|Working hours]] must not be excessive &amp; [[overtime]] must be voluntary
* Legal and fair pay
* No [[child labor]]
* No [[Contemporary slavery|forced or involuntary labor]]
* No [[discrimination]]
* [[Employment|Employees]] must be treated with [[dignity]] and [[respect]]
* [[Employment|Employees']] [[Freedom of association|right of association]] must be observed 
* Individual written labor [[contract]]s must be provided 
* [[Occupational safety and health|Working conditions are safe]] and [[Employment|employee]] health is not endangered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin-Hi|first1=Nick|title=Study on the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE Process|journal=University of Mannheim|date=2012|url=http://woek.de/web/cms/upload/pdf/aktion_fair_spielt/publikation/lin-hi_2012_study_on_the_icti_care_process.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification ===

When a [[factory]] is awarded a Seal of [[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] by the Ethical Toy Program this denotes their adherence to the Ethical Toy Program. The Ethical Toy Program offers Seals of Compliance from Class A to C depending on the maximum number of [[working time|hours worked]].

''''A [[management system]] is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an organization can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.

After World War II, the reigning paradigm of product-oriented mass production had reached its peak. Examples of management systems at that time are [[Assembly lines|linear assembly lines]], organizational hierarchies of command, [[Quality control|product quality control]] and mass consumption.

Soon afterwards, the [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]-[[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]] process-quality teachings spearheaded a new quality orientation (later referred to as [[Total quality management]]) and propelled Japan directly to the post-war process focus (process quality control, [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]], continuous improvement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-08-29/deming-and-juran-the-kings-of-quality | title=Deming And Juran: The Kings Of Quality | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US responded by a painful and prolonged product-to-process transformation, ultimately leveling the playing field again by the mid 1980s.

At the end of the 1980s, [[business process reengineering]] focused on the radical redesign of the production process through the reintegration of task, labor and knowledge. As a result, lean, flexible and streamlined production processes were created, capable of fast response and internet-based integration necessary for the upcoming phase of supply chains - [[business-to-business]] (B2B) – as well as demand chains – [[Consumer-to-business|business-to-customer]] (B2C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/advice/18436/the-evolution-of-management/ | title=The Evolution of Management | publisher=Business Matters | year=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicleadershipinstitute.net/news/the-historical-evolution-of-management-theory-from-1900-to-present-the-changing-role-of-leaders-in-organizations-/ | title=The Historical Evolution of Management Theory from 1900 to Present: The Changing role of Leaders in Organizations | publisher=Strategic Leadership Institute | last=Bosman | first=Manie | year=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
In the above three stages of '''Evolution of Management Systems''', the competitive advantage was derived almost exclusively from the internal resources of the firm. At the end of the 1980s, a radical fourth shift has occurred: the competitive advantage became increasingly derived from the external resources of the firm – through the extended networks of suppliers and customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;sid=f425a546-b334-4aff-a38e-a48ccc251d39%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4108 | title=THE EVOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS | date=March 1970 | last=Ackoff | first=Russell L. | journal=CORS Journal | volume=8 | issue=1 | page=P 1–13 | issn=0574-9638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figure 1 Basic scheme product, process, external networks.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 1 Basic scheme: product, process, external networks'''|533x533px]]
Figure 1 refers to the basic scheme of production and service delivery process. It represents the traditional linear input-process-output management system. This system has been fixed and unchanging for centuries. The only change has been in terms of changing focus on individual components of the system, emphasizing different parts of this basic scheme.

Although the scheme itself (inputs → process → outputs) remains mostly unchallenged, there are some indications that this business model will undergo major restructurings in the future (in the emerging stages of Evolution of Management Systems). It will become disaggregated and distributed, subjected to non-linear modularity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slotine|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Modular Stability Tools for Distributed Computation and Control|journal=International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing|volume=17|url=http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/preprints/modular.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and bringing forth new ways of making things and delivering services. Then it will become reintegrated again, tying together globally distributed components into a unified recycling whole.

== Early stages ==
All early stages are characterized by changing focus of attention within the unchanging, invariant scheme of Figure 1. The management system has typically focused on:

=== Final product ===

The final product is a primary focus, the production process is considered secondary. Its operations and their sequences are technologically fixed or ‘given’. Product quality is ‘inspected in’, mostly at the end of the process. [[Statistical quality control]], [[inventory control]], cost minimization, mass production, [[assembly line]], work specialization, hierarchies of command, mass consumption, statistical mass markets and forecasting are among the defining characteristics of this stage.

=== Partitioned process ===
It is the high-quality process that assures the high-quality product. The main focus was on improving of process operations. Quality of the process was understood as the quality of its operations. Powerful new concepts of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM), [[Continuous Improvement Process]] ([[Kaizen]]) and Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have characterized this stage. Although the operations were being improved, the process architecture and structural sequencing were kept intact and remained technologically ‘given’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.springer.com/978-3-642-36683-3 | title=The Evolution of the Concept of‘Management Control’ | publisher=Springer | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrated process ===
The focus of attention shifted from operations (circles) to linkages (arrows) – thus changing the process architecture itself. The reengineering of the process, re-integrating individual components into effective, more autonomous and even self-manageable wholes, has characterized this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansoff|first=H. Igor|title=Conceptual underpinnings of systematic strategic management|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|date=January 1985|volume=19|issue=1|page=P 2–19|issn=0377-2217|doi=10.1016/0377-2217(85)90303-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production process became a business process and therefore subject to qualitative redesign and reengineering ([[Business process reengineering|BPR]]). Discontinuous improvement and process innovation replaced the piecemeal continuous improvement. Traditional vertical hierarchies of command have flattened out into more horizontal, process-oriented networks. [[Mass customization]], disintermediation, [[knowledge management]] and autonomous teams have started emerging.

== Extended process ==
[[File:Extended process and Customer Intervention Point.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 2 Extended process and Customer Intervention Point'''|463x463px]]
Figure 2 refers to the paradigmatic shift from internal processes expanded into the extended process – including supplier networks and alliances as well as customer self-service, [[mass customization]] and disintermediation – as the increasingly external sources of competitive advantage.

In this recently peaked stage, networks of suppliers and communities of customers have extended the internal process into a functional and competitive whole. Both internal and external sources of knowledge and competitiveness have formed new core competencies. Supply and demand chains management have emerged, in dependence on shifting CIP (Customer Intervention Point). [[Intranets]] and [[extranets]] have provided a communication medium for B2B and B2C exchanges. Quality has become bundled together with cost, speed and reliability..

Today, powerful processes of [[global sourcing]] bring forth and foster a new set of relationships with customers and suppliers. The firm starts disaggregating its production processes, transferring, leasing or selling selected pieces off to a higher-added value operator or coordinator. Any firm can be only as good as is the network of which it is a part. Consequently, the firm has disaggregated and became a network.

== Distributed process ==
This emerging stage represents the most radical business refocusing so far. Through the [[global sourcing]], sections and components of the internal process are being outsourced to external providers and contractors in search of the highest added value contribution. Long-term alliances are formed and companies are transforming themselves into networks. Network cooperation is replacing corporate competition: ''[[coopetition]]'' emerges. The majority of companies (also the educational and training institutions) could still be the leading global players in this incessant and accelerating paradigm shifting. Globally distributed process ushers in new forms of organization, coordination and modular integration.

[[File:Distributed process and Outsourcing.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 3 Distributed process and Outsourcing'''|466x466px]]
Different parts of the extended process are geographically distributed and often spatially remote. In Figure 3, this distribution is represented by sections OS of the process which have been outsourced to higher added-value providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Gina Colarelli|title=Organizing for Radical Innovation: An Exploratory Study of the Structural Aspects of RI Management Systems in Large Established Firms|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|date=November 2006|volume=23|issue=6|page=P 475–497|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f425a546-b334-4aff-a38e-a48ccc251d39%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4108|issn=0737-6782|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00219.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Stage 5 (Figure 3) represents the most radical business refocusing emerging so far, still rapidly emerging kernels of the next stage (Figure 4) is taking shape. The evolutionary process, driven by relentless global search for maximum added value, is clearly accelerating. Management systems paradigm or business model, after a century of relative invariance, is becoming a new dynamic source of competitive advantage. Radically distributed supply and demand chains of Stage 5 will clearly have to be coordinated and reintegrated on a global scale. Reintegration processes are proceeding under increasing environmental pressures. The search for added value, after exploring traditional global resources, is now turning towards reuse, recycling, recovery and remanufacturing as new sources of maximizing added value. Innovation in business models will become a norm.

== Recycled process ==
[[File:Recycled Process and Global Sourcing.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 4 Recycled Process and Global Sourcing'''|465x465px]]
During the process of utilizing added value, the asset-recovery practices expand quickly to a majority of products and services (Dell, IBM, Xerox). New products are being designed for extended life spans and multiple profit cycles. Reverse logistics and [[Reverse logistics|reverse logistics management]] (RLM) are adding new loops to the traditionally unidirectional processes of supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Steps Forward, One Step Back...|url=http://www.infosys.com/industries/retail/white-papers/Documents/reverse-logistics-management.pdf|publisher=Infosys|author=Saty Chawla}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old supply chains have become demand chains and now reverse value chains, demonstrating that value can be added in both directions: through the forward pass of production as well as through the backward pass of recovery and remanufacture. Concepts of easy disassembly, durability, reuse and recycling are built in into equipment design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassey|first=Olivier|title=Exploring the weak signals of starts-ups as a folksonomic system|journal=Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management|date=April 2009|volume=21|issue=3|page=P 321–332|doi=10.1080/09537320902750632|issn=0953-7325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figure 4 refers to closed-loop management system and it represents the Stage 6 of the '''Evolution of Management Systems'''. The new loops in the figure are not just traditional information feedback loops, but real business processes of collection, disassembly, reprocessing and reassembly activities (operations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hbr.org/product/double-loop-management-making-strategy-a-continuous-process/an/B0007A-PDF-ENG | title=Double-Loop Management: Making Strategy a Continuous Process | last=Kaplan | first=Robert | journal=Harvard Business Review | year=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventional open-ended linear processes are being redesigned towards closure.

New loops of recycled products and materials, [[energy recovery]] and knowledge renewal are being created within [[Global Sourcing and Supply (GSS)|global-sourcing]] (GS) networks. Product reuse/remanufacture relies on a high residual value which gives a good head start for added value maximization. The system becomes organizationally closed and potentially long-term sustainable or even trans-generations self-sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_great_transformer | title=The great transformer: The impact of the Internet on economic growth and prosperity | publisher=McKinsey Global Institute | last=Roxburgh | first=Charles | year=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "openness" and customization of the product design, upgradeable products, flexible product platforms, mutability and waste-free strategies are being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/whitepaper2/emerging-green-intelligence-104141.pdf | title=Business Analytics and Corporate Sustainability | publisher=BusinessWeek Research Services | year=2009 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in this latest stage, new employee skills and managerial knowledge, as well as essential mass customization mindset are yet to be produced, maintained and renewed. Eliminating non-value added resources is still necessary. Integrating production system elements and work functions still needs time to evolve.

== Evolutionary spiral ==
[[File:The evolutionary spiral of Six Management Systems (SMS).PNG|'''Figure 5 The evolutionary spiral of Six Management Systems (SMS)'''|368x368px]]

Evolutionary spiral of the six management systems (SMS) are indicated in Figure 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/01sr005.pdf | title=Spiral Development and Evolutionary Acquisition | publisher=Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute | author=W. J. Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is appropriate to notice that six-management-system evolution is progressing in an accelerated fashion, the periods of stasis are getting shorter and revolutions are occurring faster. Individual management systems are beginning to overlap and their boundaries are getting blurred. An era of continuous change in business models and management systems emerges: the search for competitive advantage (one over the other) becomes relentless, strenuous and resources depleting. Cooperation networks have to merge into larger entities, reducing competition and expanding collaboration. The search for collaborative advantage (for both jointly) will become the new mode of economic behavior.

'''Giancarlo Iliprandi''' (15 March 1925 – 16 September 2016) was an Italian graphic designer.

==Early years==
Born in [[Milan]], in 1949 Iliprandi graduated in painting and in 1953 in scenography from the [[Brera Academy]]. He was  a self-taught graphic designer, inspired by Antonio Boggeri, [[Max Huber (graphic designer)|Max Huber]], Albe Steiner and [[Bruno Munari]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Daniele Baroni, Maurizio Vitta. ''Storia del design grafico''. Milano, Longanesi, 2003. {{ISBN|978-88-304-2011-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s he was able to get commissions from important companies including [[RAI]], [[Honeywell]], [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]], [[La Rinascente]], [[FIAT]], [[Standa]] and Electa.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Giorgio Fioravanti.

'''Karl Gustaf Patrik de Laval''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡɵsːtav dɛ laˈvalː|-|Sv-Gustaf_de_Laval.ogg}}; 9 May 1845 –  2 February 1913) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer and inventor who made important contributions to the design of [[steam turbine]]s and [[dairy]] machinery.

==Life==
[[File:Gustaf de Lavals smedja.jpg|thumb|left|upright|de Laval's forge in Kloster]]
Gustaf de Laval was born at [[Orsa Municipality|Orsa]] in [[Dalarna]] in the Swedish de Laval [[Huguenot]] family (immigrated 1622 - Claude de Laval, soldier - knighted de Laval 1647). He enrolled at the [[Royal Institute of Technology|Institute of Technology in Stockholm]] (later the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH) in 1863, receiving a degree in mechanical engineering in 1866, after which he matriculated at [[Uppsala University]] in 1867.

He was then employed by the Swedish mining company, [[Stora Enso|Stora Kopparberg]]. From there he returned to Uppsala University and completed his doctorate in 1872. He was further employed in [[Kloster, Sweden|Kloster Iron works]] in Husby parish, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Modern compressible flow"&gt;Anderson.J.D, Modern compressible flow, Mcgraw Hills, third edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustaf de Laval was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] from 1886. He was a successful engineer and businessman. He also held national office, being elected to Swedish parliament, from 1888 to 1890 and later became a member of the senate. De Laval died in Stockholm in 1913 at the age of 67.&lt;ref name="Modern compressible flow"/&gt;

== {{anchor|contributions}}Contributions ==

=== [[de Laval nozzle]]===
In 1882 he introduced his concept of an impulse steam turbine&lt;ref name=smil&gt;{{cite book|page= 62| title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867-1914 and Their Lasting Impact|author= Vaclav Smil|isbn= 0-19-516874-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Transformer+coltman+1988&amp;ct=result#PPA64,M1|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1887 built a small steam turbine to demonstrate that such devices could be constructed on that scale. In 1890  Laval developed a [[nozzle]] to increase the steam jet to supersonic speed, working from the kinetic energy of the steam, rather than its pressure.  The nozzle, now known as a [[de Laval nozzle]], is used in modern [[rocket engine nozzle]]s.  De Laval turbines can run at up to 30,000 rpm.  The turbine wheel was mounted on a long flexible shaft, its two bearings spaced far apart on either side.  The higher speed of the turbine demanded that he also design new approaches to reduction gearing, which are still in use today.  Since the materials available at the time were not strong enough for the immense centrifugal forces, the output from the turbine was limited, and large scale electric steam generators were dominated by designs using the alternative compound steam turbine approach of [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]].&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; 
 
Using high pressure steam in a turbine that had oil-fed bearings meant that some of the steam contaminated the lube-oil, and as a result, perfecting commercial steam-turbines required that he also develop an effective oil/water separator. After trying several methods, he concluded that a centrifugal separator was the most affordable and effective method. He developed several types, and their success established the centrifugal separator as a useful device in a variety of applications.

=== De Laval cream separators and Alfa Laval ===
De Laval also made important contributions to the dairy industry, including the first centrifugal [[milk]]-[[cream]] [[cream separator|separator]] and early [[milking machine]]s, the first of which he patented in 1894. It was not until after his death, however, that the company he founded marketed the first commercially practical milking machine, in 1918. Together with Oscar Lamm, de Laval founded the company [[Alfa Laval]] in 1883, which was known as ''AB Separator'' until 1963 when the present name was introduced.

=== DeLaval ===
In 1991, Alfa Laval Agri, a company producing dairy and farming machinery was split from Alfa Laval when it was bought by the [[Tetra Pak]] Group. When Alfa Laval was sold, Alfa Laval Agri remained a part of the Tetra Pak group and was renamed [[DeLaval]], after the company's founder.

He also owns [[Venevision International]], which produces and distributes media and entertainment products throughout the world, and [[Venevisión]], a Venezuelan television network. Since 1980 the Group has owned the [[Miss Venezuela]] contest and since 2001 also the [[Leones del Caracas]] baseball team.

Long an advocate of free enterprise&lt;ref name=GustavoCisneros-UnEmpresarioGlobal-2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GustavoCisneros-Pioneer-2004 /&gt;{{rp|259}} Cisneros has for many years been expanding his operations outside of Venezuela and into overseas markets, including the U.S., Spain and more recently China.&lt;ref name=TVLatina-Profile-2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg-China-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cancel|first1=Daniel|title=Billionaire Cisneros to team with Chinese banks in Latin America oil, gold|url=http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/id=1202497702659/Billionaire-Cisneros-to-team-with-Chinese-banks-in-Latin-America-oil-gold?slreturn=20170325045735|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his major accomplishments has been a major role in the international development of [[telenovela|telenovelas]] &amp;ndash; emotion-packed melodramas based on the harsh realities of life in Latin America that are now broadcast to about 2 billion people around the world.

In August 2013, Gustavo Cisneros appointed his daughter [[Adriana Cisneros]] de Griffin as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cisneros.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald-AdrianCisneros-Feature-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krischer Goodman|first1=Cindy|title=Adriana Cisneros: The New Face of Cisneros Group|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/biz-monday/article1956732.html|accessdate=6 September 2015|work=[[Miami Herald]]|date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald-AdrianaCisnerosVideo-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yearwood|first1=John|title=Adriana Cisneros - Interview with The World Desk The Miami Herald|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUNgmFa61Vs|work=[[Miami Herald]]|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Although Cisneros and [[Hugo Chávez]] were originally friends and Cisneros contributed to Chávez's first presidential campaigns, Cisernos has been accused of involvement in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]] against Chávez after their relationship became strained because of Chávez's confrontation of the media.&lt;ref name=Chavez-Kozloff-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kozloff|first1=Nikolas|title=Hugo Chávez: Oil, Politics and the Challenge to the United States|date=2007|publisher=Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-250-10506-6|pages=50-52, 58|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hugo-chavez-oil-politics-and-the-challenge-to-the-united-states/oclc/933613844/viewport|oclc=933613844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilenceAndTheScorpion-2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Brian A.|title=The Silence and the Scorpion: The Coup against Chávez and the Making of Modern Venezuela|date=2009|publisher=Nation Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-786-72744-5|pages=73, 79, 96, 159-223|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/silence-and-the-scorpion-the-coup-against-chavez-and-the-making-of-modern-venezuela/oclc/646810078/viewport|oclc=646810078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
''{{see|Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros}}''
Cisneros supports two philanthropic entities: ''[[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]]'' and ''Fundación Cisneros''.

''Fundación Cisneros'' runs a wide range of educational and cultural programs aimed at improving the lives of Latin Americans.&lt;ref name=FundacionCisneros-QuienesSomos-AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundación Cisneros: Quienes Somos|url=http://www.fundacioncisneros.org/quienessomos.html|website=Fundación Cisneros|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the AME program for professional development of Latin American educators, visual arts education and awareness based on the ''Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros''; PPV, a visual thinking curriculum for Latin American school children, and traveling art exhibits showcasing the talents of Latin American artists for North America and European audiences.&lt;ref name=ExpansionMexico-CisnerosArt-2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sierra Laffite|first1=Michelle|title=Por Amor al Arte|url=http://expansion.mx/expansion/ideas/2007/02/19/por-amor-al-arte/amp|work=[[Expansión (Mexico)]]|date=19 February 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros'' is a privately held Latin American art organization based in [[Venezuela]] and [[New York City]]. Patricia and Gustavo Cisneros began collecting Latin American abstraction after their marriage, in 1970. Over the years, it has grown to more than 2,000 pieces, including about 200 Spanish colonial objects. In addition, the couple have amassed a vast holding of ethnographic material from the Amazon.&lt;ref name="Spreading the riches"/&gt; Based in New York and Caracas, the ''Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros'' today also includes works by Uruguay’s [[Joaquín Torres-García]], Brazil’s [[Lygia Clark]] and Venezuelan modern masters [[Jesus Soto]], [[Alejandro Otero]], and [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]]. The Cisneros Foundation was moving toward building a permanent institution in Caracas in the late 1990s until [[Hugo Chavez]] was elected president. In 2007, the foundation encountered resistance from the Chavez government when lending works by Venezuelan painter [[Armando Reveron]] (1889-1954) to New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]] for the museum’s first retrospective devoted to a single Latin American artist in 50 years.&lt;ref name="An art trove ends its nomadic phase"&gt;Chris Kaul (January 28, 2009), [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/28/entertainment/et-cisneros28 An art trove ends its nomadic phase] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Franklin Bronson''' (February 24, 1817 &amp;ndash; December 7, 1889) was an [[Americans|American]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[lumber baron]] known as one of [[Ottawa]]'s early entrepreneurs, establishing a large lumber mill at [[Chaudière Falls]] on the Ottawa River. Bronson's efforts helped to convert a fledgling small town into a prosperous city.

Bronson was born in [[Moreau, New York|Moreau Township]], [[Saratoga County, New York]] in 1817 and studied at Poultney Academy in [[Vermont]]. He was hired as a clerk in John J. Harris' lumber business; he became a junior partner in 1840. Harris, a friend of Bronson's, had land in northern New York state, and mills on the upper Hudson River lakes.&lt;ref name="knowles2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  He had been impressed by Bronson's "integrity, resolute will, sound constitution and capacity for hard work".&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

In search of new sources of timber, Bronson visited the [[Ottawa Valley]] in the summer of 1848.  With [[Bytown]]'s [[Chaudière Falls]] as a potential source for power, and the large amount of timber in the area, he decided "on the spot" that the islands located there would be a good location for a sawmill.&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

Bronson and Harris went to Bytown in 1852, and after urging the superintendent of the Ottawa River Works, Horace Merrill, to recommend that crown-owned "hydaulic lots" at Chaudière be offered to entrepreneurs, the lots became available in September.&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;  They bought some land on nearby [[Victoria Island (Ottawa River)|Victoria Island]]'s north side, paying $200.20 to the [[Province of Canada]], and with it came the right to use the water as an energy source and "to build a flume to propel their mills and carry saw logs to the property for 21 years."&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;  They were soon able to acquire nearby building lots that had been "made available at greatly reduced prices, thanks to a recommendation made to the Canadian government by Ottawa mayor [[Richard William Scott|R. W. Scott]]."&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

The mill was set up at the Chaudière Falls on the [[Ottawa River]] and they acquired timber limits on the [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]], [[Dumoine River|Dumoine]] and [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]]s. The Harris, Bronson and Coleman (later Harris and Bronson)&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt; company mainly supplied markets in the northeastern United States.  The large plant had "novel iron gates", 74 upright and four circular saws.&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;  The Harris and Bronson Company was set up in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="collections"&gt;[http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=100565&amp;rec_nbr_list=97669,105278,100565,97713,97708,180608,162670,101498,98427,3838248 Library and Archives Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronson's pioneering entrepreneurship preceded many other notables, who also came from the United States, namely [[William Goodhue Perley|Perley]] and Pattee [Chaudière Falls mill], as well as [[Ezra Butler Eddy|Eddy]], and Canada's largest sawmill builder, [[John Rudolphus Booth]].&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

Bronson settled at Bytown in 1853. When Harris retired in 1866, wholesale lumber merchant Abijah Weston and Bronson's son [[Erskine Henry Bronson|Erskine Henry]] joined the firm.  In 1867 the company became known as the Bronsons and Weston Lumber Company.  The company operated wholesale outlets in [[Albany, New York]], [[Boston]] and [[Burlington, Vermont]], acquired cutting rights to [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests in [[California]] and established their own bank.

When the [[Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty|Reciprocity Treaty]] with the United States ended in 1866, Bronson lobbied for reinstating the treaty; he became a supporter of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] federally and provincially.  The Province of Canada treaty with the US was significant for Bronson because it "permitted Canadian planks and boards to enter that country duty-free".&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

With [[William Goodhue Perley]] and [[James Skead]], Bronson was also a promoter of the Upper Ottawa Steamship Company.

In 1869 he founded the [[Ottawa Ladies' College]] in association with the [[Presbyterian Church of Canada|Presbyterian Church]]. The college was later sold to the first President H.M Tory and Vice President M.M. MacOdrum of Carleton College in 1942. Carleton College has since become Carleton University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc.library.carleton.ca/collections/browse/ottawa_ladies_college Ottawa Ladie's College - Carleton University Archives] Retrieved 2012-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronsons and Weston Lumber Company was incorporated, 1888, under c. 103, and its name was changed to "Bronson Company", 1899, c. 96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/TablePrivateActs/miscellaneous.html Department of Justice Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronson died at Ottawa in 1889. Erskine Henry continued to manage the company until 1899 when it became a [[holding company]], the Bronson Company.

"Erskine Henry Bronson and Walter Goodman Bronson carried on the family business after the death of their father in 1899, followed by Frederick Erskine Bronson after the death of Walter Goodman Bronson in 1932. In the sixties, Frederic Bronson donated a large portion of the Bronson Company's land holdings to the National Capital Commission. A few years later, the National Capital Commission expropriated the rest of the company."&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

Bronson had transformed the falls into an industrial site, and helped to convert a "backwoods village into a prosperous city".&lt;ref name="knowles2005"/&gt;

'''Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IA&amp;AS)''' is an Indian Central Government service, free of control from any executive authority, under the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]]. The officers of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service serve in an audit managerial capacity, in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. IA&amp;AS is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments and public sector organizations, and for maintaining the accounts of State governments. Its role is somewhat similar to the US [[GAO]] and [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]].

The service can be divided into officers looking after accounting and audit issues pertaining to the Union government and the State governments, and those manning the department's headquarters. The state accounts and audit offices are headed by Accountants General or Principal Accountants General. They are functionally equivalent; only the designations vary. Major states have three Principal Accountants General (PAsG) or Accountants General (AsG), each heading Accounts and Entitlement (i.e., compiling state accounts, maintaining pension accounts, loan accounts, etc.), General and Social Sector Audit (GSSA) or Economic and Revenue Sector Audit (ERSA).

The equivalent officers at the Central level are Principal Directors (PDs) or Directors General (DsG). The PDs, DsG, AsG and PAsG report to Additional Deputy CAG  (also called ADAI, for historical reasons) or Deputy CAG (called DAI, again for historical reasons). The Deputy CAGs are the highest-ranked officers in the service.

After training, the Officer Trainees are posted as Assistant Accountant General Assistant Directors a Junior Grade Group A later promoted to Deputy Accountants General (DAsG) or Deputy Directors (DDs) a Senior time scale. Subsequent to their promotion, they become Senior Deputy Accountants General (Sr.DAsG) or Directors. All officers below the rank of AG/PD are also called Group Officers as they are generally in charge of a group in the office.

==Recruitment and training==

Recruitment to the IA&amp;AS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Union Public Service Commission) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to the IA&amp;AS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the [http://www.naaa.gov.in National Academy of Audit and Accounts], [[Shimla]], Himachal Pradesh, India. The training is split into two phases. Phase-1 involves giving a theoretical background to the students on concepts of Government and commercial auditing and accounting. Phase-2 gives emphasis on practical training. The training involves modules where Officer Trainees are attached to the Reserve Bank of India,TISS-Mumbai,SEBI the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, NIFM Faridabad, the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The Officer Trainees are also given an international exposure through attachment with London School of Economics and Political Science and [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">'''Kahraman Sadıkoğlu''' is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] businessman. He owns the [[Istanbul]]-based Sadikoglu Group.

He paid for the restoration of one of the largest yachts in the world, the ''[[MV Savarona|Savarona]]''. She was purchased by the Turkish government in 1938 for use as a presidential yacht by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], but was later allowed to fall into disrepair after his death. Mr Sadikoglu leased the vessel in 1989 from the Turkish government and invested 50 million dollars to restore its former beauty. Afterwards he rented her out for luxury cruises. The lease contract was rescinded after a media scandal in 2010 and the Turkish Government took the ship back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/27038601.asp ''Hürriyet'' Aug 23rd, 2014: Atatürk'ün yatı 'Savarona' kullanıma hazır]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Sadıkoğlu was kidnapped in the [[Iraq]]i port city of [[Umm Qasr]] by terrorists, who demanded a [[US$]]25 million ransom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diggersrealm.com/mt/archives/000564.html Kahraman Sadikoglu, Turkish Businessman, Kidnapped By Terrorists In Iraq : Diggers Realm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in February 2006 following the payment of a much smaller sum, said by his wife to be "less than $1m" and by the Turkish newspaper ''[[Vatan]]'' to be $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4266873.stm BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Turkish businessman freed in Iraq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2700">[[File:Karl von Meck.jpg|thumb|200px|Karl von Meck (date unknown)]]
'''Karl Otto Georg von Meck''' (Карл Фёдорович фон Мекк), (22 June 1821 &amp;ndash; 26 January 1876, Moscow) was an important 19th century [[Russians|Russian]] businessman of [[Germans|German]] descent, one of the founders of [[Russian railways]].

==Family==
Baron Karl von Meck came from an old [[Baltic-German]] noble family originally from [[Silesia]]. His father was major Otto Adam von Meck, a customs officer in [[Riga]]. His mother was Wilhelmine Hafferberg, a daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm and Catharine Constanze Nott, who in her second marriage was the wife of Carl Ludwig von Veichtner, a son of composer [[Franz Adam Veichtner]].

In 1844 Karl von Meck graduated from the [[St. Petersburg]] Institute of Communications and joined the Moscow-Warsaw road upgrade project as a service road engineer. In 1860 von Meck left public service and entered business. After the military defeat in [[Crimea]] many people became aware of the importance of rail transportation. Von Meck entered the ''Saratov Railway Association'' with the aim of constructing a private rail line between [[Moscow]] and [[Saratov]] with independent finance. The first phase of construction was the line between [[Moscow]] and Kolomna. This site was put into operation, after only two years work, as the funds of the company had been exhausted and the entire operation quickly went bankrupt.

Karl von Meck persevered and in 1863 found work with the new ''[[Moscow-Ryazan Railway Association]]''. The Chairman of the Board appointed von Meck as the main contractor and the road was built over a year and a half, and made an enormous profit. Karl von Meck participated in several other railway ventures but none with such financial success. However his diligence, tenacity and effort were widely recognised and acknowledged.

After his death his widow, [[Nadezhda von Meck]], provided invaluable assistance to [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. Karl von Meck's son, [[Nikolai von Meck]], played a significant role in the development of [[Russians|Russian]] railways and worked on the People's Commissariat of Railroads until he was arrested for [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]] in 1928. He was convicted and executed in 1929.

'''Mahafarid Amir Khosravi''' ({{circa|1969}} – May 24, 2014), also known as '''Amir Mansour Aria''' ({{lang-fa| امیر منصور آریا }}), was an [[Iran]]ian businessman who was executed for his part in the [[2011 Iranian embezzlement scandal]].&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran billionaire executed over $2.6B bank fraud|date=May 24, 2014|work=USA Today|agency=AP|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/24/iran-billionaire-executed-over-26b-bank-fraud/9535639/|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one time, he was considered the richest man in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richest man of Islamic Republic and main suspect of big banking fraud hanged in Evin prison!|date=May 24, 2014|url=http://iranian.com/posts/view/post/33015|work=Lenz Iran|publisher=Iranian.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment made in April 2012 suggested he would rank as 219th among ''[[Forbes]]''{{'}} richest people in the world if included on [[The World's Billionaires 2012|the list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alef.ir/vdcgqy9qzak9tt4.rpra.html?14txt|script-title=fa:امیر خسروی ، دویست و نودمین ثروتمند جهان|last=شریفی|first=هادی|date=May 8, 2012|publisher=Alef|language=fa|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khosravi graduated from high school with a 10.42 [[Grading_systems_by_country#Iran|GPA]] (on a scale of 20). He then was accepted at [[Islamic Azad University of Zanjan]] for [[civil engineering]], but was dismissed after six semesters with a [[Academic grading in Iran|GPA]] of 6.23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alef.ir/vdccomqi42bqim8.ala2.html?227798|script-title=fa:مه آفرید امیر خسروی که بود؟ / از تولید جعبه میوه و کار روی پیکان تا تاسیس داماش و بانک آریا|date=May 24, 2014|publisher=Alef|language=fa|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Khosravi finished his military service in 1993.&lt;ref name=background /&gt;

He and his brother were running a cattle ranch when Khosravi began getting loans for its facilities during 2005/06. At that time, he started a privately held company called Aria Investment Development Company with his family. Khosravi widened his relations with banks and, in 2010, requested to start his own bank, which was founded in the same year. According to Mohammad Reza Khabbaz, a member of the Iranian Parliament, Khosravi was supported by some government officials and used this influence to buy large stocks of many companies and hectares of land at prices well below the market value.&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jomhourieslami.com/1390/13900629/13900629_03_jomhori_islami_akhbar_dakheli_0015.html|script-title=fa:جديدترين جزئيات از جلسه غيرعلني مجلس در گفت‌وگوي مشروح فارس با خباز؛ واگذاري صدها هكتار زمين به 'اختلاس‌گر بزرگ' در كيش و كاشانك با قيمت متري 16ريال|date=September 20, 2011|work=Jomhourieslami|language=fa|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, Khosravi's business holdings included more than 35 companies engaging in diverse business segments including mineral water, meat importation, and a football club. His net worth exceeded US$1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;&lt;ref name=PressTV /&gt; In 2011, an investigation into fraudulent loans at [[Bank Saderat]], one of Iran's top banks, was launched. It was determined that Khosravi was the mastermind of a scheme that generated US$2.6 billion of loans with forged documents, dating back to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45095069/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/iran-parliament-question-ahmadinejad-over-fraud/|title=Iran parliament to question Ahmadinejad|last=Dareini|first=Ali Akbar|date=October 30, 2011|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, bank managers were bribed by Aria Investment Development Company to accept the forged documents.&lt;ref name=SkyNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Hangs Billionaire Over $2.6bn Bank Fraud|date=May 24, 2014|work=Sky News|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1268233/iran-hangs-billionaire-over-2-6bn-bank-fraud|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loans were then used to purchase state-owned businesses, effectively privatizing the companies using state funds since the loans would not be repaid.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Accuses Businessman of Bank Fraud|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/world/middleeast/13iran.html|date=September 12, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2014|work=The New York Times|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the investigation, Khosravi's company was worth 50 million [[Iranian toman|tomans]] in June 2006, and had reached a value of 20 billion tomans by February 2009 due primarily to the loans transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/312259/%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C-%D9%BE%DB%8C%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%A9-%D8%A2%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7|title=جدیدترین اطلاعات درباره متهم به سوء استفاده 2800 میلیارد تومانی|date=September 22, 2011|publisher=همشهری‌ آنلاین|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/312259/%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%87-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C-%D9%BE%DB%8C%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%A9-%D8%A2%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7|title=از تولید جعبه میوه و کار روی پیکان تا تاسیس داماش و بانک آریا|date=May 24, 2014|publisher=مشرق نيوز|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khosravi was charged with being [[Mofsed-e-filarz|"corrupt on earth"]], a charge that would make him an enemy of God and carry the death penalty.

'''Predictive modelling''' uses statistics to predict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Geisser|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Geisser. 
|title=Predictive Inference: An Introduction|page={{Page needed|date=September 2016}}|date=September 2016|publisher=Chapman &amp;  Hall|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1137379276|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of [[detection theory]] to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an [[email]] determining how likely that it is [[e-mail spam|spam]].

Models can use one or more [[classifier (mathematics)|classifiers]] in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set, say spam or 'ham'.

Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of [[machine learning]], as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as [[predictive analytics]].

Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest.  In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships.  This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that "correlation is not the same as causation."

==Models ==
[[File:Artificial Neural Network.jpg|alt=Artificial Neural Network|thumb|301x301px|An image of the interconnectedness of nodes in an artificial neural network.]]
Nearly any [[regression model]] can be used for prediction purposes.  Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: [[Parametric model|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric models|non-parametric]]. A third class, [[Semi-parametric model|semi-parametric]] models, includes features of both. Parametric models make "specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)",&lt;ref name=Sheskin&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheskin|first=David J.|title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures|date=April 27, 2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=1439858012|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; while non-parametric regressions make fewer assumptions than their parametric counterparts.&lt;ref name=Marascuilo&gt;{{cite book|last=Marascuilo|first=Leonard A.|title=Nonparametric and distribution-free methods for the social sciences|date=December 1977|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|isbn=0818502029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinary Least Squares===
[[Ordinary least squares]] is a method that minimizes the sum of squared distances between observed and predicted values.

===Generalized Linear Models (GLM)===
The [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) is a flexible family of models that are unified under a single method.  [[Logistic regression]] is a notable special case of GLM. Other types of GLM include [[Poisson regression]], gamma regression, and [[multinomial regression]].

===Logistic regression===
[[Logistic regression]] is a technique in which unknown values of a discrete variable are predicted based on known values of one or more continuous and/or [[discrete variable]]s. [[Logistic regression]] differs from [[Ordinary least squares|ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]] in that the dependent variable is binary in nature. This procedure has many applications. In [[biostatistics]], the researcher may be interested in trying to model the probability of a patient being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer based on knowing, say, the incidence of that cancer in his or her family. In business, the marketer may be interested in modelling the probability of an individual purchasing a product based on the price of that product. Both of these are examples of a simple, binary logistic regression model.  The model is "simple" in that each has only one independent, or predictor, variable, and it is "binary" in that the dependent variable can take on only one of two values: cancer or no cancer, and purchase or does not purchase.

===Generalized additive models===
[[Generalized additive model]] is a smoothing method for multiple predictors that allows for non-parametric predictions.

===Robust regression===
[[Robust regression]] includes a number of modelling approaches to handle high leverage observations or violation of assumptions. Models can be both parametric (e.g. regression with Huber, White, Sandwich variance estimators) and non-parametric(e.g. quantile regression).&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Rand R.|title=Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441955240|pages=200–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiparametric regression===
[[Semiparametric regression]] includes the proportional odds model and the Cox proportional hazards model where the response is a rank.

==Presenting and using the results of a predictive model==
Predictive models can either be used directly to estimate a response (output) given a defined set of characteristics (input), or indirectly to drive the choice of decision rules.&lt;ref name=Steyerberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Steyerberg|first=Ewout W.|title=Clinical Prediction Models|date=October 21, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441926488|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the methodology employed for the prediction, it is often possible to derive a formula that may be used in a '''spreadsheet software'''.  This has some advantages for end users or decision makers, the main one being familiarity with the software itself, hence a lower barrier to adoption.
  
'''Nomograms''' are useful graphical representation of a predictive model.  As in spreadsheet software, their use depends on the methodology chosen.  The advantage of nomograms is the immediacy of computing predictions without the aid of a computer.

'''Point estimates''' tables are one of the simplest form to represent a predictive tool.  Here combination of characteristics of interests can either be represented via a table or a graph and the associated prediction read off the y-axis or the table itself.
 
'''Tree-based methods''' (e.g. CART, survival trees) provide one of the most graphically intuitive ways to present predictions. However, their usage is limited to those methods that use this type of modelling approach which can have several drawbacks.&lt;ref name=Breiman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breiman|first=Leo|title=Bagging predictors|journal=Machine Learning|date=August 1996|volume=24|issue=2|pages=123–140|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018054314350|doi=10.1007/bf00058655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees can also be employed to represent decision rules graphically.

'''Score charts''' are graphical tabular or graphical tools to represent either predictions or decision rules.

A new class of '''modern tools''' are represented by web-based applications.  For example, Shiny is a web-based tool developed by Rstudio, an R IDE.  With a Shiny app, a modeller has the advantage to represent any which way he or she chooses to represent the predictive model while allowing the user some control.  A user can choose a combination of characteristics of interest via sliders or input boxes and results can be generated, from graphs to confidence intervals to tables and various statistics of interests. However, these tools often require a server installation of Rstudio.

==Applications==

===Uplift modelling===
[[Uplift modelling]] is a technique for modelling the ''change in probability'' caused by an action. Typically this is a marketing action such as an offer to buy a product, to use a product more or to re-sign a contract. For example, in a
retention campaign you wish to predict the change in probability that a customer will remain a customer if they are contacted. A model of the change in probability allows the retention campaign to be targeted at those customers on whom the change in probability will be beneficial. This allows the retention programme to avoid triggering unnecessary [[churn rate|churn]] or [[customer attrition]] without wasting money contacting people who would act anyway.

===Archaeology===
Predictive modelling in [[archaeology]] gets its foundations from [[Gordon Willey]]'s mid-fifties work in the Virú Valley of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1953) "Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Virú Valley, Peru", Bulletin 155. Bureau of American Ethnology&lt;/ref&gt; Complete, intensive surveys were performed then [[Covariance|covariability]] between cultural remains and natural features such as slope, and vegetation were determined.  Development of quantitative methods and a greater availability of applicable data led to growth of the discipline in the 1960s and by the late 1980s, substantial progress had been made by major land managers worldwide.

Generally, predictive modelling in archaeology is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., and the presence of archaeological features.  Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the "archaeological sensitivity" of unsurveyed areas can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas.  Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD),&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberg, Kurt, et al.  "An Evaluation of the Archaeological Sample Survey Program at the Nevada Test and Training Range",  SRI Technical Report 02-16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Altschul, Lynne Sebastian, and Kurt Heidelberg, "Predictive Modeling in the Military: Similar Goals, Divergent Paths", Preservation Research Series 1, SRI Foundation, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy.  By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites.

===Customer relationship management===
Predictive modelling is used extensively in analytical [[customer relationship management]] and [[data mining]] to produce customer-level models that describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. The actions are usually sales, marketing and customer retention related.&lt;ref&gt;http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/wondering-what-lies-ahead-the-power-of-predictive-modeling/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a large consumer organization such as a mobile telecommunications operator will have a set of predictive models for product [[cross-sell]], product deep-sell (or [[upselling]]) and [[churn rate|churn]]. It is also now more common for such an organization to have a model of savability using an [[uplift modelling|uplift model]]. This predicts the likelihood that a customer can be saved at the end of a contract period (the change in churn probability) as opposed to the standard churn prediction model.

===Auto insurance===
Predictive modelling is utilised in [[vehicle insurance]] to assign risk of incidents to policy holders from information obtained from policy holders. This is extensively employed in [[usage-based insurance]] solutions where predictive models utilise telemetry-based data to build a model of predictive risk for claim likelihood.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Black-box auto insurance predictive models utilise [[GPS]] or [[accelerometer]] sensor input only.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some models include a wide range of predictive input beyond basic telemetry including advanced driving behaviour, independent crash records, road history, and user profiles to provide improved risk models.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Health care===
In 2009 [[Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System]] began analyzing electronic medical records in order to use predictive modeling to help identify patients at high risk of readmission. Initially the hospital focused on patients with congestive heart failure, but the program has expanded to include patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/hospital-uses-data-analytics-and-predictive-modeling-identify-and-allocate-scarce-resources |title=Hospital Uses Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling To Identify and Allocate Scarce Resources to High-Risk Patients, Leading to Fewer Readmissions |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Banerjee et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Imon |title=Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) Utilizing Free-Text Clinical Narratives |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=8 |issue=10037 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27946-5 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) for estimating short-term life expectancy (&gt;3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence.The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). It achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. To provide explain-ability, they developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model’s predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable the model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians.

=== Algorithmic trading ===
Predictive modeling in trading is a modeling process wherein we predict the probability of an outcome using a set of [[explanatory variable|predictor variables]]. Predictive models can be built for different assets like stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/predictive-modeling-algorithmic-trading/|title=Implementing Predictive Modeling in R for Algorithmic Trading|date=2016-10-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive modeling is still extensively used by trading firms to devise strategies and trade. It utilizes mathematically advanced software to evaluate indicators on price, volume, open interest and other historical data, to discover repeatable patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://systemtradersuccess.com/predictive-model-based-trading-systems-2/|title=Predictive-Model Based Trading Systems, Part 1 - System Trader Success|date=2013-07-22|newspaper=System Trader Success|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable failures of predictive modeling===
Although not widely discussed by the mainstream predictive modeling community, predictive modeling is a methodology that has been widely used in the financial industry in the past and some of the major failures contributed to the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. These failures exemplify the danger of relying exclusively on models that are essentially backward looking in nature. The following examples are by no mean a complete list:

1) Bond rating. S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch quantify the [[probability of default]] of bonds with discrete variables called rating. The rating can take on discrete values from AAA down to D. The rating is a predictor of the risk of default based on a variety of variables associated with the borrower and historical [[macroeconomic]] data. The rating agencies failed with their ratings on the US$600 billion mortgage backed Collateralized Debt Obligation ([[Collateralized debt obligation|CDO]]) market. Almost the entire AAA sector (and the super-AAA sector, a new rating the rating agencies provided to represent super safe investment) of the CDO market defaulted or severely downgraded during 2008, many of which obtained their ratings less than just a year previously.

2) So far, no statistical models that attempt to predict equity market prices based on historical data are considered to consistently make correct predictions over the long term. One particularly memorable failure is that of [[Long Term Capital Management]], a fund that hired highly qualified analysts, including a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner, to develop a sophisticated statistical model that predicted the price spreads between different securities. The models produced impressive profits until a major debacle that caused the then [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] to step in to broker a rescue plan by the [[Wall Street]] broker dealers in order to prevent a meltdown of the bond market.

=== Possible fundamental limitations of predictive model based on data fitting===

1) History cannot always accurately predict the future: Using relations derived from historical data to predict the future implicitly assumes there are certain lasting conditions or constants in a complex system. This almost always leads to some imprecision when the system involves people.

2) The issue of unknown unknowns: In all data collection, the collector first defines the set of variables for which data is collected. However, no matter how extensive the collector considers his/her selection of the variables, there is always the possibility of new variables that have not been considered or even defined, yet are critical to the outcome.

3) Self-defeat of an algorithm: After an algorithm becomes an accepted standard of measurement, it can be taken advantage of by people who understand the algorithm and have the incentive to fool or manipulate the outcome. This is what happened to the CDO rating described above. The CDO dealers actively fulfilled the rating agencies' input to reach an AAA or super-AAA on the CDO they were issuing, by cleverly manipulating variables that were "unknown" to the rating agencies' "sophisticated" models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12439">{{Canadian politics}}
The '''Public Service Commission of Canada''' ('''PSC'''; {{lang-fr|Commission de la fonction publique du Canada}}) is an independent government agency that safeguards merit-based hiring, non-partisanship, representativeness of Canada's diversity and the use of both official languages (English and French) in the Canadian public service. The PSC aims to protect the integrity of hiring and promotion within the public service. As well, the Commission works to protect the political impartiality and non-partisanship of public servants. The Commission develops staffing policies and provides guidance to public service managers and recruits Canadians into the public service. To ensure the staffing system in the government is properly maintained, the PSC has the authority to audit and investigate to ensure departments and managers make improvements. While typical government departments are headed by Ministers, the PSC is an independent agency that is headed by a President (currently Patrick Borbey) who reports to the Canadian Parliament.

==Mandate and goals==
The PSC has the mandate to appoint people to the public service, and to promote people within the government which can in turn be delegated to deputy heads (often referred to as Deputy Ministers in Canada).  The PSC can also assist government departments with recruitment and assessment services.
The PSC oversees the integrity of the hiring and promotion system, and makes sure that the hiring process is not compromised by partisan interference from elected officials. Part of this overseeing role involves collecting and analyzing data on hiring and promotion in the public service (e.g., hiring of different groups, by region, by department). As well, the PSC performs audits across the staffing system, examining  hiring and promotion files, to ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit. Lastly, the PSC administers the Part VII of ''Public Service Employment Act'' that recognizes the rights of public service employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiallity in the public service.
  
The mission of the PSC is to achieve "A highly competent, non-partisan and representative Public Service, able to provide services in both official languages and in which employment practices are characterized by fairness, access, representativeness and transparency

==Program Activities==
The PSC has set out four program activities that are done to reach its strategic outcome:

*The Appointment Integrity and Political Neutrality activity (policies and standards on safeguarding the integrity of hiring and promotion and political neutrality issues)
*The Oversight of Integrity of Staffing and Political Neutrality (makes sure that the integrity of public service hiring and promotion is protected and safeguards the political neutrality of public servants)
*The Staffing Services and Assessment activity (provides managers with tools to help them assess and select employment applicants).
*The Internal Services program activity (corporate management and planning frameworks for the Management Accountability Framework, finance, internal staff, information technology, communications, and other administrative and general support).

==Public Service Employment Act==
The 2003 ''Public Service Employment Act'' (which came into force on December 31, 2005) emphasizes the values of merit, non-partisanship, fairness, access, transparency and representativeness.

Merit refers to the use of essential qualifications during the hiring and promotion process. This means that people who are hired and promoted in the public service must possess certain competencies, skills, and experience (merit), rather than based on political connections or partisan affiliations (political patronage). The merit principle requires that every person who is appointed to the public service has met the essential qualifications and requirements established for the position. The essential requirements can include official language proficiency, asset qualifications, operational requirements (e.g., availability to do shift work or work on weekends), and organizational needs (e.g., need to increase the hiring of women) that have been identified by the head of a department or agency.

Non-partisanship means that appointments of people to the public service (and promotions of public servants )have to be made without political influence from Ministers or partisan officials. Although Canadian public servants were disallowed any involvement in political activities in their private time throughout much of the 20th century, in 1967, legislative changes allowed public servants to request permission to take leave without pay to run in an election. In 1991, a Supreme Court decision gave public servants the right to engage in political activities. The 2003 Public Service Employment Act clarified what political activities public servants are allowed to engage in.

Public servants can engage in political activities such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, but they have to maintain their political impartiality as public servants. In order to comply with the non-partisanship values in the Act, public servants must only do the types of political activities that do not conflict or impair their ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a politically impartial manner. The type and degree of political activities that a public servant can engage in depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service.

==Historical timeline==
* Before [[responsible government]], Canada had no real civil service; government officials were appointed by either [[the Crown]] or its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] representatives. These officials usually served for an unspecified period ("during the pleasure of the Crown") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Civilservice-CanadianHistory.htm|title=Civil Service in Canada|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Marionopolis College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1849 - when responsible government began in 1849, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another.
* 1868 - the ''Canada Civil Service Act'' was enacted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm|title=A Timeline of the Public Service Commission of Canada|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703131234/http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/research/timeline/psc_timeline_e.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The "Civil Service Act" of 1882 created a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a Board of Civil Service Examiners
* 1908 - the ''Civil Service Amendment Act'' created the Civil Service Commission, an independent body to oversee appointments to government positions in Ottawa (this was called the "inside service", in contrast to the public service outside the capital).
* The ''[[Civil Service Act 1918]]'' set in place merit-based appointments and reinforced the independence of the Commission. It also brought the "outside service" (the public service outside of Ottawa) under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the "inside service".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]]. ''So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921''.  Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1920s - the Commission developed its competitive system of examinations for appointment and [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the [[patronage]] system.
* 1921 - formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955.
* 1924 - The Civil Service Superannuation Act was intended to promote and protect a career civil service.
* 1932 - staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities.
* 1949 - the number of [[World War II]] veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000.
* 1951 - The Financial Administration Act of 1951 provided final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service.
* 1957 - The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants.
* 1961 - The new Civil Service Act of 1961 gave civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals.
* 1962 - The Government adopted recommendations by the [[Royal Commission on Government Organization]] (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance.
* 1966 - [[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] becomes an element of merit in the national capital area.
* 1967 - Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a [[collective bargaining]] regime in the civil service.
* early 1970s - rapid expansion of the public service.
* Late 1970s - significant reduction of public service.
* 1979 - The Bilingualism Bonus was introduced for public servants who met the bilingual language requirements of their positions.
* 1984 - the Commission on Equality in Employment issued its report, which recommended that targets and not quotas are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups.
* 1986 - further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service.
* 1992 - Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit.
* 1995 - a restraint-focused federal budget leads to further reductions in the size of the civil service.
* Late 1990s and early 2000s - rapid growth of the public service
* 2003 - a new Public Service Employment Act, which created the first legislative definition of merit (it also redefined merit)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6554">'''Recharacterisation''' in [[law]] (and sometimes in [[accountancy]]) means the treatment of a certain course of conduct in a different manner to which the participants describe it.

The term is most important in the penal law of Continental legal systems. In some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, judges are empowered to "recharacterise the facts" of a case to make the charges more closely align with the evidence. In these systems, the legal charges contained in the indictment are only suggestions from the public prosecutor to the court.&lt;ref&gt;German Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozeßordnung ["StPO"]), § 206&lt;/ref&gt; The judge may, if it becomes clear that the facts actually support different or additional charges, change the legal characterisation of those facts.

Under [[English law]], [[Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth|Lord Hanworth MR]] referred to the proposition:

{{cquote|It is old law, and plain law, that in transactions of this sort the Court must consider whether or not the documents really mask the true transaction.  If they do merely mask the transaction, the Court must have regard to the true position, in substance and in fact, and for this purpose tear away the mask or cloak that has been put upon the real transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Re George Inglefield Ltd'' [1933] Ch 1 at 17.  Applied in ''[[Re Curtain Dream plc]]'' [1990] BCLC 925.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the recharacterisation of the facts results in additional charges, or charges which carry a greater penalty, the defense council is usually given an opportunity to be heard concerning the recharacterisation and may request a suspension of the trial to study the recharacterisation.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: France, Code of Criminal Procedure Art. § 118&lt;/ref&gt; In others, this right to suspend the trial is only implicated if the recharacterisation results in more serious charges.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Malta, Criminal Code § 597(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some legal systems, the court may not recharacterise the facts if it will result in more serious charges.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Russian Federation, Code of Criminal Procedure art. 252(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the United States the term recharacterisation (or '''recharacterization''') is usually used to refer to money which is advance to a [[company (law)|company]] as a [[loan]] by a [[shareholder]] or other insider, which is recharacterised on [[bankruptcy]] as a capital contribution to the shareholder's equity.
* Also in the USA, '''recharacterization''' is used in tax law to refer to treatment for tax purposes of a transaction, agreement, event, etc., differently than for other purposes.  Examples include recharacterization of gains as dividends under {{USC|26|1248}}, recharacterization of purported debt instruments as equity under case law and rulings under {{USC|26|385}}, and recharacterization of entities under "[[entity classification|check the box]]" regulations {{CodeFedReg|26|301|7701-2}}.
* In other [[common law]] legal systems, recharacterisation usually refers to the risk that a title transfer arrangement could be treated instead as the grant of a [[security interest]]. If a transaction is recharacterised in this manner, there is a risk that the transaction may be void if it has not been registered under applicable registration laws.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England, most grants of a security interest must be registered within 21 days at [[Companies House]]&lt;/ref&gt; The title transfer arrangements that are perceived to be vulnerable to recharacterisation are transfers of [[margin (finance)|margin]] (such as a title transfer under an English Law ISDA Credit Support Annex as collateral for a derivatives transaction), or transactions which involved an actual transfer of securities backed by cash (such a [[stock loan]] or [[repo transaction]]). [[Retention of title clause]]s may also sometimes be recharacterized in this manner. [[Security interest]]s which are expressed as fixed charges are sometimes recharacterised as [[floating charge]]s. However, in most common law systems, there is a resistance to recharacterisation transactions of this nature, and the law generally provides that the parties own characterisation of the transaction should be applied unless there are strong countervailing reasons to recharacterise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Welsh Development Agency v Export Finance Co Ltd]]'' [1992] BCLC 148, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another area in which the courts have had to address recharacterization risk is in relation to the transfer of [[Accounts receivable|receivables]], frequently in [[securitization]] transactions. To be effective a securitization normally requires a "true sale" of receivable, but in certain countries there is a risk of the transfer being recharacterised.&lt;ref name = "Secret Liens"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"], American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  If the originator retains a right or an obligation regarding the transferred assets, for example, where the transferor has agreed to assume and bear the credit risk for the transferred receivables, or where the transferor is entitled or obligated to repurchase and regain the transferred receivables, under many legal systems this would be recharacterised as either an on-loan or a collection agency arrangement.
* Certain sophisticated financial instruments (such as a [[synthetic lease]]) are considered to be a recharacterization risk in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstam.com/faf/html/cust/jm-rechar-outline.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the application of recharacterization is also a general principle of the law of most countries, and may be applied to an artificial arrangement which seeks to artificially overcome a certain law or regulation. For example, in ''[[Street v Mountford]]'' [1985] 1 AC 809 the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] confirmed that an agreement described as a license for non-exclusive occupation of a property should, in fact, be treated as a [[leasing|lease]] for the purposes of determining the licensees' (or tenants') rights, although [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] did not actually use the phrase "recharacterisation" in his speech.  Similar, in many jurisdictions, [[tax]] authorities have power recharacterize transactions that are "shams", or which otherwise have no commercial substance except to mitigate tax liability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Roger De Clerck''' (July 27, 1924 – October 23, 2015) was a Belgian entrepreneur and CEO of the [[Beaulieu International Group|Beaulieu textile group]]. An international business man, his family was ranked 15th place in a list of "richest Belgians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derijkstebelgen.be/vermogende/familie-de-clerck/|title=Familie De Clerck - De Rijkste Belgen|work=De Rijkste Belgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime he was controversial due to a series of scandals where he and his company were accused of [[fiscal fraud]].

==Biography==

De Clerck born in  [[Wielsbeke]], the second son of a [[flax]] farmer who owned a large farm, "Ter Lembeek" there. His two brothers became priests.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dma28012005_026|title=Dallas in Vlaanderen: de familie Beaulieu|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nephew of minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert De Clerck|nl}} (father of politician [[Stefaan De Clerck]]) and the brother of Thérèse De Clerck, wife of {{Interlanguage link multi|Willy De Nolf|nl}}, founder of [[Roularta]].

In 1951 De Clerck married Anne-Marie Hanssens from [[Gullegem]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; In normal circumstances he would have taken over his father's farm, but the [[flax]] market collapsed around this time and he was forced to look for another source of income. De Clerck decided to produce [[loom]]s and later [[carpet]]s. In 1959 he founded the carpet company "Beaulieu", which became an international trader in the next few decades. He also became a politically active member of the [[Christelijke Volkspartij|CVP]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

In 1991, because of internal struggles between his heirs, De Clerck divided his empire among them. Jan De Clerck received ''Domo''. Luc became head of ''Berry Group''. Mieke of ''[[Associated Weavers]]''. Francis ''[[Ideal Group]]''. Ann ''Beaulieu Kruishoutem'' and Dominiek ''Ter Lembeek''. Five of his six children kept their head department in Belgium, only Mieke moved hers to the USA.

In 1992 Jan De Clerck's eleven-year-old son, Anthony De Clerck, was kidnapped by the gang of [[Danny Vanhamel]]. A [[ransom]] of 250 million Belgian francs was demanded, but after a month Anthony was freed and the kidnappers arrested.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s ''Beaulieu'' felt more rivalry from foreign companies. In 2005 four branches of the company were merged into one company ''Beaulieu International Group'', which is still the largest West European carpet group. The only branches that were kept out were ''Domo'' (because Jan had fallen into dishonor with his father) and ''Beaulieu in America'' (which Mieke preferred to keep independent). At this point none of the De Clercks was part of the daily management and in October 2005 De Clerck himself also stepped down.

==Scandals==

In 1987 Roger De Clerck had his first run-in with the law. He was suspected of having exported large fortune from his companies to foreign counties under the veil of commission fees. A money export of about 1,5 to 2 billion Belgian francs were traced. He was found guilty, but his punishment was dismissed because his social position and the employment of his personnel could become endangered. In 1989 five business employees, including his sons Jan and Dominiek, spent a week in jail in England, because they had sold their carpets in black market money.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; Couriers smuggled the money in their clothing and luggage to Belgium. Two years later De Clerck bought his sons off with 2 million euro, without any prosecution or conviction coming about.

In 1997 Jan De Clerck and his partner Martine Van De Weghe were arrested. An associate of Jan, Ronny Verhoeven - who was a banker at [[Generale Bank]] in [[Sint-Niklaas]] - had whitewashed black market money through fake commission fees and bills. Verhoeven admitted this fraud in September 1997. In April 1998 Jan De Clerck was forced to do the same. Him and his wife admitted the fraud and paid 2,5 million euro.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; A year later they paid another 50 million euro to pay off their overdue personnel taxes and venture taxes. This caused a drift between them and the rest of the family, who kept repeating they were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/bijzondere-belastingsinspectie-en-beaulieu-blijven-bikkelen/article-normal-91030.html|title=Bijzondere Belastingsinspectie en Beaulieu blijven bikkelen|work=knack.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger De Clerck himself was suspected from [[false document|forgery of documents]], gang organisation and violation of the laws for venture taxes.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; He was also thought to have tried to bribe investigation judges and researchers. The Beaulieu group was thought to have had paid fake commission payments to a Libanese business family for years.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; They officially acted as middle man for the sales in the Middle-East and Russia, but according to the researchers they were simply [[straw men]]. Their commission payments on sold products were meant to scoop off the profits of the Beaulieu branches and were returned to the family in the shape of loans, investments or black market money. The case kept going for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1326161/2011/09/29/Staat-legt-zich-nog-niet-neer-bij-fraudezaak-Beaulieu.dhtml|title=Staat legt zich nog niet neer bij fraudezaak Beaulieu|work=HLN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 it was revealed that a new research was started to clear out suspicions of [[whitewashing]] in a Luxembourgian venture. Business shares which belonged to a Libanese businessman were carried over to the De Clerck family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/nieuw-fraudeonderzoek-tegen-beaulieu-en-familie-de-clerck/article-normal-140737.html|title=Nieuw fraudeonderzoek tegen Beaulieu en familie De Clerck|work=knack.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==

Despite his massive wealth and large company imperium De Clerck was often nicknamed "Boer Clerck" ("Farmer Clerck") in the media, because of his roots in the farming industry, his local dialect and his simple-minded behavior. He detested this nickname himself.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

In 1999 De Clerck celebrated his 75th birthday. This event attracted a lot of press attention when he invited world-famous politicians to meet him at his garden party, including [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[George H.W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109300|title=Remarks at Roger De Clerck's Birthday Party|work=margaretthatcher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was invited too, but had to excuse himself because his wife, [[Raisa Gorbachev]], was seriously ill. She would die that same year. De Clerck's son Jan was not invited because he had fallen into disgrace.

==Death==

De Clerck died in 2015 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/textiel/Roger_De_Clerck_is_overleden.9690659-3117.art?ckc=1&amp;ts=1445588859|title=Roger De Clerck is overleden|work=Tijd.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.2476716|title=One of Flanders’ most well-known entrepreneurs dies aged 91|work=flandersnews.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Lewis "Ted" Bates''' (September 11, 1901 – May 30, 1972) was an American [[advertising]] executive who founded a worldwide [[advertising agency]] that bears his name: [[Ted Bates (advertising firm)|Ted Bates Inc.]]

==Biography==
Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Bates attended [[Phillips-Andover Academy]], then graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1924. He founded Ted Bates &amp; Co. in 1940, which evolved into the 21st-century advertising agency [[Bates 141]]. His empire launched in Asia in the early 1960s after acquiring a stake in Cathay Advertising from [[George Patterson (advertiser)|George Patterson]], an Australian advertising executive.  Cathay Advertising was used by Bates as a vehicle to drive expansion in the region so that by the late 1960s, Ted Bates Inc. was operating in [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Bates-Worldwide-Inc-Company-History.html Bates Worldwide, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1982, the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF) inducted Bates with [[Charles H. Brower]] and [[Bernice Fitz-Gibbon]] to the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]]. His creative partner, advertising maverick [[Rosser Reeves]], described the reasons for Bates' success at the induction: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two things not commonly known which I want to put on the record today. Very early on at one fell swoop, Ted Bates gave away 90 percent of his agency to his key people. When I asked him why, he said, 'Rosser, I would rather own 10 percent of a success than 100 percent of a failure.' And that leads to the other thing. By making us rich and therefore making us work like demons, Ted built an agency that for the first 26 consecutive years did not lose a client...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advertisinghalloffame.org/nominations/ahof09_cfn.pdf Advertising Hall of Fame] (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
