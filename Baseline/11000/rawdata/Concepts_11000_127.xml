      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14882">The '''18-electron rule''' is a rule used primarily for predicting and rationalizing formulae for stable metal complexes, especially [[organometallic compounds]].&lt;ref name="Check1" &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.54.1386.59 | author-link = Irving Langmuir|last=Langmuir |first=I. | title = Types of Valence | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | year = 1921 | volume = 54 | issue = 1386 | pages = 59–67|bibcode = 1921Sci....54...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is based on the fact that the [[valence shell]]s of [[transition metal]]s consist of nine valence orbitals (one [[s orbital]], three [[p orbitals]] and five [[d orbitals]]), which collectively can accommodate 18 [[electron]]s as either bonding or nonbonding electron pairs.  This means that, the combination of these nine [[atomic orbitals]] with [[ligand]] orbitals creates nine [[molecular orbital]]s that are either metal-ligand bonding or non-bonding. When a metal complex has 18 valence electrons, it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the [[noble gas]] in the period. The rule and its exceptions are similar to the application of the [[octet rule]] to main group elements. The rule is not helpful for complexes of metals that are not transition metals, and ''interesting or useful transition metal complexes will violate the rule'' because of the consequences deviating from the rule bears on reactivity.  The rule was first proposed by American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Check1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origin of the 18-Electron Rule |first1=William B.|last1=Jensen |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Educ.]]|date= 2005 |volume=82 |issue=1 |page=28 |bibcode=2005JChEd..82...28J|doi=10.1021/ed082p28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
The rule usefully predicts the formulae for [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin complexes]] of the Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co triads.  Well-known examples include [[ferrocene]], [[iron pentacarbonyl]], [[chromium carbonyl]], and [[nickel carbonyl]]. &lt;!--redundant with lead paragraph In compounds such as these, the nine bonding molecular orbitals are all low in energy. Because putting electrons into them is a favourable process, and as each orbital can take two electrons, the greatest stability is achieved when there is a total of 18 electrons in these orbitals - this includes both the electrons that come from the metal, and those donated to it from the ligands.  This is the basis of the 18-electron rule.  This stability is such that much chemistry is guided by a metal's need to retain or get 18 electrons.--&gt;

Ligands in a complex determine the applicability of the 18-electron rule. In general, complexes that obey the rule are composed at least partly of [[Pi backbonding|π-acceptor ligands]] (also known as π-acids). This kind of ligand exerts a&amp;nbsp; very strong [[ligand field]], which lowers the energies of the resultant molecular orbitals so that they are favorably occupied.  Typical ligands include [[olefin]]s, [[phosphines]], and [[carbonyl|CO]]. Complexes of π-acids typically feature metal in a low-oxidation state.  The relationship between oxidation state and the nature of the ligands is rationalized within the framework of [[π backbonding]].

===Consequences for reactivity===
Compounds that obey the 18-electron rule are typically "exchange inert". Examples include [[Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Molybdenum carbonyl|Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Ferrocyanide|[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;]].  In such cases, in general ligand exchange occurs via [[dissociative substitution]] mechanisms, wherein the rate of reaction is determined by the rate of dissociation of a ligand.  On the other hand, 18-electron compounds can be highly reactive toward electrophiles such as protons, and such reactions are associative in mechanism, being acid-base reactions.

Complexes with fewer than 18 valence electrons tend to show enhanced reactivity.  Thus, the 18-electron rule is often a recipe for non-reactivity in either a [[stoichiometric]] or a [[catalysis|catalytic]] sense.

===Duodectet rule===
Current computational findings suggest valence p-orbitals on the metal participate in metal-ligand bonding, albeit weakly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Frenking |editor1-first=Gernot|editor2-last=Shaik |editor2-first=Sason|title=The Chemical Bond: Chemical Bonding Across the Periodic Table |publisher=Wiley-VCH |date=May 2014 |chapter=Chapter 7: Chemical bonding in Transition Metal Compounds |isbn=978-3-527-33315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new theoretical treatments do not count the metal p-orbitals in metal-ligand bonding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these orbitals are still included as [[Basis set (chemistry)|polarization functions]]. This results in a duodectet (12-electron) rule for one s-orbital and five d-orbitals only, but the modified rule has yet to be adopted by the general chemistry community.

==Exceptions==
π-donor or σ-donor ligands with small interactions with the metal orbitals lead to a weak [[Ligand field theory|ligand field]] which increases the energies of t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. These [[molecular orbital]]s become [[Non-bonding orbital|non-bonding]] or weakly anti-bonding orbitals (small Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;). Therefore, addition or removal of electron has little effect on complex stability. In this case, there is no restriction on the number of d-electrons and complexes with 12–22 electrons are possible. Small Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; makes filling e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;* possible (&gt;18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and π-donor ligands can make t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; antibonding (&lt;18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These types of ligand are located in the low-to-medium part of the [[spectrochemical series|spectrochemical]] series. For example: [TiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (Ti(IV), d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, 12&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (Co(III), d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, 18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [Cu(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Cu(II), d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, 21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).

In terms of metal ions, Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; increases down a group as well as with increasing [[oxidation number]]. Strong ligand fields lead to [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin]] complexes which cause some exceptions to the 18-electron rule.

===16-electron complexes===
An important class of complexes that violate the 18e rule are the 16-electron complexes with metal d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; configurations. All [[Spin states (d electrons)|high-spin]] d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions are [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] (or [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]]), but the [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin]] d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions are all square planar. Important examples of square-planar low-spin d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal Ions are Rh(I), Ir(I), Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II). At picture below is shown the splitting of the d subshell in low-spin square-planar complexes. Examples are especially prevalent for derivatives of the cobalt and nickel triads.  Such compounds are typically  [[square-planar]]. The most famous example is [[Vaska's complex]] (IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [PtCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Zeise's salt]] [PtCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  In such complexes, the d&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is doubly occupied and nonbonding.

Many [[catalytic cycle]]s operate via complexes that alternate between 18-electron and square-planar 16-electron configurations.  Examples include [[Monsanto acetic acid synthesis]], [[hydrogenation]]s, [[hydroformylation]]s, olefin isomerizations, and some alkene polymerizations.

Other violations can be classified according to the kinds of ligands on the metal center.

===Bulky ligands===
Bulky ligands can preclude the approach of the full complement of ligands that would allow the metal to achieve the 18 electron configuration.
Examples: 
*Ti([[neopentyl]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (8&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Pentamethylcyclopentadiene|Cp*]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) (16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[vanadium hexacarbonyl|V(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Cp*Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Pt(P[[tert-butyl|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;]]3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Co([[norbornyl]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (13&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
Sometimes such complexes engage in [[agostic interaction]]s with the hydrocarbon framework of the bulky ligand.  For example:
*W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has 16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; but has a short bonding contact between one C–H bond and the W center.
*[[Cyclopentadiene|Cp]](PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(CHCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, diamagnetic) has a short V–H bond with the 'alkylidene-H', so the description of the compound is somewhere between Cp(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(CHCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and Cp(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(H)(CCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===High-spin complexes===
High-spin metal complexes have singly occupied orbitals and may not have any empty orbitals into which ligands could donate electron density. In general, there are few or no π-acidic ligands in the complex.  These singly occupied orbitals can combine with the singly occupied orbitals of radical ligands (e.g., [[oxygen]]), or addition of a [[ligand field theory|strong field]] ligand can cause  electron-pairing, thus creating a vacant orbital that it can donate into.
Examples: 
*CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;([[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]])&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (15&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[Mn(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, see comments below)
Complexes containing strongly π-donating ligands often violate the 18-electron rule.  These ligands include [[fluoride]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[oxide]] (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitride]] (N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[alkoxide]]s (RO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[imide]]s (RN&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Examples:
*[CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Mo(=NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (12&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
In the latter case, there is substantial donation of the nitrogen lone pairs to the Mo (so the compound could also be described as a 16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; compound).  This can be seen from the short Mo–N bond length, and from the angle Mo–N–C(R), which is nearly 180°.
Counter-examples: 
*''trans''-WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Cp*ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
In these cases, the M=O bonds are "pure" double bonds (i.e., no donation of the lone pairs of the oxygen to the metal), as reflected in the relatively long bond distances.

===π-donating ligands===
Ligands where the coordinating atom bear nonbonding lone pairs often stabilize unsaturated complexes.  Metal amides and alkoxides often violate the 18e rule.

===Combinations of effects===
The above factors can sometimes combine. Examples include 
*Cp*VOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Titanium(IV) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

===Higher electron counts===
Some complexes have more than 18 electrons. Examples:
* [[Cobaltocene]] (19&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Nickelocene]] (20&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The hexaaquacopper(II) ion [Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''TM''(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (''TM'' = Sc, Y, La) (20 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)

Often, cases where complexes have more than 18 valence electrons are attributed to electrostatic forces – the metal attracts ligands to itself to try to counterbalance its positive charge, and the number of electrons it ends up with is unimportant.  In the case of the metallocenes, the [[chelation|chelating]] nature of the cyclopentadienyl ligand stabilizes its bonding to the metal. Somewhat satisfying are the two following observations: cobaltocene is a strong electron donor, readily forming the 18-electron cobaltocenium cation; and nickelocene tends to react with substrates to give 18-electron complexes, e.g. CpNiCl(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and free CpH.

In the case of nickelocene, the extra two electrons are in orbitals which are weakly metal-carbon antibonding; this is why it often participates in reactions where the M–C bonds are broken and the electron count of the metal changes to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Girolami | first1 = Gregory | last2 = Rauchfuss | first2 = Thomas | last3 = Angelici | first3 = Robert | title = Synthesis and Technique in Inorganic Chemistry | chapter = Experiment 20 | publisher = University Science Books | location = Sausalito, California | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-935702-48-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20-electron systems TM(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (TM = Sc, Y, La) have a cubic (''O''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) equilibrium geometry and a singlet (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;) electronic ground state. There is one occupied valence MO with a&lt;sub&gt;2u&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, which is formed only by ligand orbitals without a contribution from the metal AOs. But the adducts TM(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  (TM=Sc, Y, La) fulfill the 18-electron rule when one considers only those valence electrons, which occupy metal–ligand bonding orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiaye|last2=Yang|first2=Tao|last3=Xin|first3=Ke|last4=Wang|first4=Guanjun|last5=Jin|first5=Xiaoyang|last6=Zhou|first6=Mingfei|last7=Frenking|first7=Gernot|date=2018-04-25|title=Octacarbonyl Anion Complexes of Group Three Transition Metals [TM(CO)8]− (TM=Sc, Y, La) and the 18-Electron Rule|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802590|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=57|issue=21|pages=6236–6241|doi=10.1002/anie.201802590|issn=1433-7851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">The '''All Species Foundation''' aimed to catalog all [[species]] on [[Earth]] by 2025.  It began in 2001 as a spinoff of the [[Long Now Foundation]].  

The Foundation started with a large grant from the Schlinger Foundation but because of the stock market crash of 2000, at least in part, it was unable to attract appreciable additional funding.   

The All Species Foundation received some criticism over the goal of identifying literally ''all'' species on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bio.cst.temple.edu/~hey/docs/2002/Letter_to_All_Species_Foundation.pdf|title=Letter to the All Species Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was that in reality species often have indistinct boundaries so that it is often not possible to objectively decide when there is a single species or multiple species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27538">'''Alliance Quebec''' (AQ) was a group formed in 1982 to [[Lobbying|lobby]] on behalf of [[English-speaking Quebecers]] in the province of [[Quebec]], Canada. It began as an [[umbrella group]] of many English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members.  At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province.  However, a prolonged decline in influence, group cohesion, membership and funding ultimately led to its closure in 2005.

== Early years — constructive engagement: 1982–1989 ==

The [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ), a party that supports the sovereignty of Quebec and the dominant use of [[French language|French]] in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the [[Quebec National Assembly]] (the province's legislature) in 1976.  The vast majority of Quebec anglophones (i.e., Quebecers who speak English as a first language), who at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see [[Language demographics of Quebec]]), did not support this party.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.135 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anglophones formed local lobby groups to promote [[federalism]] and argue against new laws such as the [[Charter of the French Language]] (also known as "Bill 101").  After the Parti Québécois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups (notably the "Positive Action Committee" and the "Council of Quebec Minorities") joined together in May 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8KQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance%20quebec%20convention&amp;pg=1240%2C1642793 |title=Montreal Gazette (February 27, 1982, p.A5) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1982-02-27 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec" (or "Alliance Québec") in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CwhnBqgSpwC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=See Marc Levine, '&amp;#39;The Reconquest of Montreal,'&amp;#39; p.124 |via=[[Google Books]]|date=1982-11-05 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AQ's ideology reflected a desire to promote the rights and interests of the English language community while recognizing there were legitimate goals being pursued by the provincial government in promoting the French language, such promotion having strong support in the majority Francophone population. Alliance Quebec's best-known accomplishments from its earliest years included:

* Alliance Quebec's first success was to lobby  the PQ to amend Bill 101. In 1983, the Charter of the French Language was amended (Law 57) to recognize in its preamble to the Charter of the French Language the institutions of the Anglophone community in Québec, abolish language testing for people educated in Quebec, and to widen the use of English in Anglophone communities and public institutions.
* Alliance Quebec also worked to get English language health and social service guarantees. As a result, in 1986, Law 142 was enacted which compels regional authorities to draw up programmes for access in the English language to health and social services throughout Quebec.
* With the financial support and legal leadership of Alliance Quebec, Bill 101's prohibition of English language signs was challenged in court. In 1988, in its decision [[Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that the prohibition of all other languages but French on public signs and posters and in commercial advertising was in opposition to the freedom of expression but opened the door to the clear predominance of French.  This solution was ultimately adopted by the Government of Quebec and prevails to this day.

The group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years.  It formed at least 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal.  The federal government subsidized AQ in an effort to promote minority official language groups in the province, providing it with most of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1986).&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=booxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;pg=5735%2C5704854 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 31, 1986, p.B-5) |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar funding was provided to French language groups outside Quebec.

In addition to AQ's regional chapters, six federally funded anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention. Affiliated Quebec anglophone universities, [[CEGEP]]s and health and social service institution and community associations were also allowed to send delegates. Institutional members brought AQ substantial public policy expertise and participated in the policy formulation process.

By the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt; (including members of regional associations affiliated with AQ, such as the [[Townshippers' Association]]). This led to critiques that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Decarie, CJAD 800 radio (August 1989); see also [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf Prosperi] at p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Alliance Quebec's founders were active in the [[Liberal Party of Quebec]], the main opposition party while the PQ was in government. The Liberal Party of Quebec won the [[Quebec general election, 1985|provincial election of 1985]], and many of AQ's initial leaders were recruited to work for the new government.  Several of AQ's highly educated and bilingual early staff members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as [[Thomas Mulcair]], [[Kathleen Weil]], and Geoffrey Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), while others served as [[Quebec National Assembly|MNAs]]—Russell Williams ([[Nelligan (electoral district)|Nelligan]]), [[Russell Copeman]] ([[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (provincial electoral district)|NDG]]).   While this initially gave AQ strong lobbying contacts within the government, the departure of many of the group's founding leaders eventually hurt the group.  Some have argued that the 1985 election was the beginning of a decline in influence of Alliance Quebec, as English-speakers believed the new government was friendlier and so the need for AQ was lower, while the Liberals had more connections with English-speakers than the PQ and so relied less on AQ to transmit their points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA201 |title=Garth Stevenson,'&amp;#39;Community Besieged,'&amp;#39; p.201 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group also faced criticism, almost since its founding, that it was not aggressive enough in its demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6WUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SaUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1316,1089228&amp;dq=alliance-quebec&amp;hl=en |title="Alliance Quebec report card: full marks for effort", '&amp;#39;Montreal Gazette'&amp;#39; (June 4, 1983) |publisher=News.google.ca |date=1983-06-04 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of [[arson]].  Then-president [[Royal Orr]] sued ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'' and [[CFTM-DT|Télé-Métropole]], for falsely reporting that he was the "prime suspect" in setting the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=805&amp;dat=19890823&amp;id=b4oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JEkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1230,3792772 |title=Candidate faces tough job|work=Stanstead Journal|date=August 23, 1989 |accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203 |author=Garth Stevenson|title=Community Besieged: The Anglophone Minority and the Politics of Quebec |via=[[Google Books]]|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|date=1999|accessdate=August 18, 2017|page=203|ISBN=9780773518391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle years — stagnation and infighting: 1989–1998 ==

AQ's weakened bargaining position was brought to prominence in 1989 when the Liberal government passed Bill 178.  Although the Liberal Party had campaigned in 1985 to loosen the legal restrictions on languages other than French, Bill 178 overturned the Supreme Court's "Ford" decision (see above), restoring the prohibition on non-French commercial signage (with an exception for small signs inside stores).   Alliance Quebec's inability to prevent the adoption of Bill 178 by the Liberal government it had perceived as an ally, opened it to criticism from the anglophone community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BtwoGqOAQoC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+arson&amp;source=web&amp;ots=R-Ui5LRwTS&amp;sig=eHv98zMAPejzb_XY5fktlZBhFLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result |title=Garth Stevenson, '&amp;#39;Community Besieged'&amp;#39;, p.204 |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right-wing critics of AQ dubbed it "Compliance Quebec" and "the lamb lobby" for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Richler, Oh Canada, Oh Quebec: Requiem for a Divided Country (Toronto:
Penguin Books, 1992), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal tension arose among the directors of AQ over the issue of denied access to English language schools in the province. Tensions increased over whether or not to support the Liberals in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|Quebec general election of 1989]] in spite of Bill 178.  Some prominent AQ leaders urged a protest vote by anglophones, either by spoiling their ballots or voting for the upstart [[Equality Party (Quebec)|Equality Party]] that opposed the Liberals' legislation. The Equality Party won four seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in 1989, but quickly lost its support due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the [[Quebec general election, 1994#Results|vote in 1994]].  Rebuffed at the ballot box, some of the Equality Party's remaining active members instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1998/040998/cover.html |title=Philip Preville, "Million Dollar Bill", Montreal Mirror (April 9, 1998) |publisher=Montrealmirror.com |date=1998-04-09 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to have AQ promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence). Public infighting between so-called "moderates" (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and "radicals" (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in [[language politics]], led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics.

While infighting preoccupied the board of directors and annual convention, the grassroots elements of AQ became less active. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied less and less on volunteers. AQ's smallest regional chapters, in Quebec's [[Magdalen Islands]], [[Basse-Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] and [[Baie-Comeau]], closed down for lack of members,&lt;ref&gt;Two members of these closed chapters could attend the annual convention: see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm Laurentianweb, "Alliance Quebec Information: Regional Community Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt; while six of the group's eight chapters on the [[Island of Montreal]] merged in order to avoid closing.&lt;ref&gt;The new Montreal Chapter could send six times as many delegates to the annual convention as the other chapters; see [http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm LaurentianWeb, "Alliance Quebec Information"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]] investigated alleged irregularities during the [[1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum]], finding among other things that votes in three mainly federalist [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] had been rejected without valid reasons. Alliance Quebec sued the Quebec government to try to force it to re-examine the rejected ballots in all 125 Quebec ridings. The trial judge ruled against AQ in 2000. AQ appealed, but ceased operations in 2005 (see below). In 2008 the Chief Electoral Officer got the court's permission to destroy the ballots after ruling that AQ's appeal had taken too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |title=CBC News (May 1, 2008) |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502083406/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/05/01/qc-referendumballots0501.html |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years — radicalization and closure: 1998–2005 ==

In May 1998, the group elected a "radical" president, [[Montreal Gazette]] columnist [[William Johnson (author)|William Johnson]]. Previously a vocal critic of AQ, he won by rallying a group known derisively as "angryphones" (mainly members of the tiny Equality Party and some listeners of right wing talk radio shows, particularly the [[Howard Galganov]] show).  He in turn supported Equality Party members for positions on AQ's board of directors.  Unlike previous presidents, he made no attempt to meet with political leaders, preferring to conduct his lobbying through media, such as on radio talk shows.  Also unlike previous presidents, who generally accepted the objectives of Bill 101 and focused on changing how it was applied, Johnson questioned the commitment to tolerance and human rights of those who supported Bill 101.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., W. Johnson, "The Historical Background of the Situation of English-speaking Quebecers", quoted in ''[http://www.neuvel.net/Quebec_ling.htm Language and Language Laws in Quebec]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After his election, Johnson organized two demonstrations against stores, in particular [[Eaton's]] and [[The Hudson's Bay Company]], that did not place English on their in-store advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1998/10/03/signs981003a.html |title=CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson told a crowd of demonstrators that he refused an Eaton's offer to put up English signs in their stores if AQ would quietly call off the protest, as Johnson wanted to make it a public issue.  Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral [[declaration of independence]].   Johnson also made headlines when the [[Entartistes]] threw a cream pie in his face while he marched in Montreal's 1998 [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |title=Montreal Gazette (16 June 2009) |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017141122/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=79c98166-3381-429f-8a64-856ac7f1d527&amp;p=1 |archive-date=2013-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's presidential campaign and his first six months as president temporarily brought more media attention and members to Alliance Quebec, as the PQ government and Quebec nationalist groups publicly criticized AQ's new, more confrontational tone.  However, Johnson called off the group's protests in October 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-21193947/precarious-peace |title=Maclean's (October 12, 1998) |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=1998-10-12 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AQ's media coverage fell considerably, never to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Alliance+Quebec%22+source%3A%22-newswire%22+source%3A%22-wire%22+source%3A%22-presswire%22+source%3A%22-PR%22+source%3A%22-press%22+source%3A%22-release%22+source%3A%22-wikipedia%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;scoring=a |title=Google News archive for "Alliance Quebec" |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's presidency and those of his similarly minded successors also provoked a negative reaction from the mainstream community of anglophones that formerly supported AQ. Links to the community's key healthcare, educational and community institutions vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/02/01/bill001201.html |title=CBC News February 1, 2000 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several events during these years highlighted the group's lack of support, which ultimately caused it to close down:

== Structure ==

Alliance Quebec was registered as a non-profit association in Quebec, with a headquarters in Montreal.  Anyone could join as a member by paying a nominal fee of $5–$10.  Membership entitled them to participate in the regional chapter in which they lived.  Each regional chapter had its own board of directors and executive and obtained their budget mainly from membership fees.

Each chapter could send 9 delegates to the annual convention, which took place each May in Montreal.  In the 1990s, six chapters in central Montreal merged, which allowed the merged chapter to send up to 54 delegates.  (In the William Johnson era, the [[West Island]] chapter's number of delegates was increased to reflect that it was the chapter with the second-largest number of members.)  A youth commission of members under thirty years of age also existed and could send up to 18 delegates to the convention.  Affiliated groups such as the Townshippers' Association could also send delegates, as could affiliated universities, hospitals and community groups.  The outgoing president and board of directors were also entitled to vote at the convention, representing 41 delegates. In theory, an annual convention could have nearly 400 delegates during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Goodfellow |url=http://www.laurentianweb.com/aqinfo1.htm#delegate |title="Alliance Quebec Information" (1998) |publisher=LaurentianWeb |date=1998-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, the number of delegates attending annual conventions decreased over time as membership fell and affiliated groups stopped participating; the annual convention in 1985 had about 470 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lhUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2aUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-maldoff&amp;pg=2286%2C31365 |title=Montreal Gazette (May 1, 1985, p.A4) |publisher=News.google.com |date=1985-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while each of the conventions from 1999 onward had under 100 delegates.

The annual convention chose the president and [[treasurer]] of AQ for the upcoming year. (In the William Johnson era, the president's term was lengthened to two years, although each subsequent president resigned before the end of their full two-year term.)  The delegates would also choose the board of directors.  Half of the forty-person board of directors of AQ would be up for election annually for a two-year term; the top twenty candidates who received the most votes being elected.  The new board of directors would meet immediately after the convention to choose the remaining executive positions, including [[vice president]], vice president "off-[[Island of Montreal|island]]" (meaning from outside of Montreal), [[Secretary (club)|secretary]], and [[chairman of the board]].  The group also had an "Advisory Council" of prominent anglophones to advise the group on important issues from time to time, but this fell into disuse by the late 1990s.

The executives and directors were [[Volunteering|volunteer]] positions (although the president received a [[stipend]].)  There were also a number of paid staff members (around two dozen in 1994),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as a general director, a fundraiser, receptionists, researchers and organizers, paid for mainly from federal government grants.

For most of its existence, AQ also maintained committees to study issues.  These included (at various times)committees for health and social services, education, access to English schools, youth employment, legal affairs, communication, internal rules, and membership.  Some committees organized events and activities. One of these activities, "Youth Employment Services", became independent of AQ in the 1990s and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmontreal.ca/yes.php] Youth Employment Services website&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger chapters also had some committees, especially in the group's early years.

'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''55''' (3): 385–399. {{doi|10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Glossary/demo_glossary.cgi?mode=history&amp;term_id=1196 Authentic life]. Psychology Centre Athabasca University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://castle.eiu.edu/~psych/spencer/Existential.html "Existential Psychology"].

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.
[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as "poseurs" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]
Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna.

In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

[[Image:Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia MHNT.jpg|thumb|right|Wind dispersal of [[dandelion]] seeds.]]

'''Biological dispersal''' refers to both the movement of individuals ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], etc.) from their birth site to their breeding site ('natal dispersal'), as well as the movement from one breeding site to another ('breeding dispersal').
Dispersal is also used to describe the movement of [[propagule]]s such as [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s.
Technically, dispersal is defined as any movement that has the potential to lead to [[gene flow]].&lt;ref name=Ronce&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronce, O. |year=2007|title= How does it feel to be like a rolling stone?

The act of dispersal involves three phases: departure, transfer, settlement and there are different fitness costs and benefits associated with each of these phases.&lt;ref name=Bonte&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bonte, D. |author2=Van Dyck, H. |author3=Bullock, J.

Dispersal can be distinguished from [[animal migration]] (typically round-trip seasonal movement), although within the [[population genetics]] literature, the terms '[[migration (disambiguation)|migration]]' and 'dispersal' are often used interchangeably.

== Types of dispersal ==
[[File:Dispersal diagram.jpeg|thumb|Dispersal from parent population]]
Some organisms are motile throughout their lives, but others are adapted to move or be moved at precise, limited phases of their life cycles. This is commonly called the '''dispersive phase''' of the life cycle. The strategies of organisms' entire life cycles often are predicated on the nature and circumstances of their dispersive phases.

In general there are two basic types of dispersal:
; Density-independent dispersal: Organisms have evolved adaptations for dispersal that take advantage of various forms of kinetic energy occurring naturally in the environment. This is referred to as density independent or passive dispersal and operates on many groups of organisms (some [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[insect]]s and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms such as [[plant]]s) that depend on animal [[dispersal vector|vectors]], wind, gravity or current for dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maguire Jr., B.|year= 1963|title= The passive dispersal of small aquatic organisms and their colonization of isolated bodies of water|doi=10.2307/1948560|jstor=1948560|volume=33|journal=Ecological Monographs|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nathan, R.|year=2001|title=The challenges of studying dispersal|url=http://bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02272-8|volume=16|issue=9|pages=481|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928204701/http://www.bio.huji.ac.il/ese/PDFs/Nathan2001TREE.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Density-dependent dispersal: Density dependent or active dispersal for many animals largely depends on factors such as local [[population]] size, resource [[competition]], [[habitat]] quality, and habitat size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johst, K.  |author2=Brandl, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|title= The effect of dispersal on local population dynamics|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(97)00112-9|journal= Ecological Modelling|volume=104|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowler&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowler, D.

Due to population density, dispersal may relieve pressure for resources in an ecosystem, and competition for these resources may be a selection factor for dispersal mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irwini, A.J.  |author2=Taylor, P.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Evolution of Dispersal in a Stepping-Stone Population with Overlapping Generations|pmid=11162790|url=http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~peter/pdf/TPB%2058%2000.pdf|journal= Theoretical Population Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=321–8|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution through [[gene flow]] and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions ([[biogeography]]).

A distinction is often made between '''natal dispersal''' where an individual (often a juvenile) moves away from the place it was born, and '''breeding dispersal''' where an individual (often an adult) moves away from one breeding location to breed elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Ronce /&gt;

==Costs and benefits ==
[[File:Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head - 3.jpg|thumb|230px|Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head]]

In the broadest sense, dispersal occurs when the fitness benefits of moving outweigh the costs.

There are a number of benefits to dispersal such as locating new resources, escaping unfavorable conditions, avoiding competing with [[sibling]]s, and avoiding breeding with closely related individuals which could lead to [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=Bowler/&gt;

There are also a number of costs associated with dispersal, which can be thought of in terms of four main currencies: energy, risk, time and opportunity.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;
Energetic costs include the extra energy required to move as well as energetic investment in movement machinery (e.g. wings). Risks include increased injury and mortality during dispersal and the possibility of settling in an unfavorable environment.
Time spent dispersing is time that often cannot be spent on other activities such as growth and reproduction.
Finally dispersal can also lead to [[outbreeding depression]] if an individual is better adapted to its natal environment than the one it ends up in. In social animals (such as many birds and mammals) a dispersing individual must find and join a new group, which can lead to loss of social rank.&lt;ref name=Bonte/&gt;

== Dispersal range ==

"Dispersal range" refers to the distance a species can move from an existing population or the parent organism. An [[ecosystem]] depends critically on the ability of individuals and [[populations]] to disperse from one habitat [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] to another. Therefore, biological dispersal is critical to the stability of ecosystems.

=== Environmental constraints ===

Few species are ever evenly or randomly distributed within or across [[landscapes]]. In general, [[species]] significantly vary across the landscape in association with environmental features that influence their reproductive success and population persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Groom MJ, Meffe GK, Carroll CR |year= 2005|isbn=0-87893-597-5|title= Principles of Conservation Biology|place= Sunderland (MA)|publisher= Sinauer Associates, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin TE|year= 1998|title= Are microhabitat preferences of coexisting species under selection and adaptive? |journal=Ecology| volume=79|issue=2|pages=656–670|url=http://www.umt.edu/mcwru/personnel/martin/PDF%20Martin/Reprint550.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0656:AMPOCS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial patterns in environmental features (e.g. resources) permit individuals to escape unfavorable conditions and seek out new locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Turner MG, Gardner RH, O'Neill, Robert V |year= 2001|title= Landscape Ecology: In theory and practice, pattern and process|place= New York |publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-95123-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within animal's geographic range. In addition, the ability of a species to disperse over a gradually changing environment could enable a population to survive extreme conditions. (i.e. [[climate change]]).

As the climate changes, prey and predators have to adapt to survive. This poses a problem for many animals, for example the [[Southern rockhopper penguin|Southern Rockhopper Penguins]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/publipdf/2003/TMEPS251.pdf|title = Geographic variation in the foraging behaviour, diet and chick growth of rockhopper penguins|last = Tremblay|first = Yann|date = April 11, 2003|journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series|doi = 10.3354/meps251279|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These penguins are able to live and thrive in a variety of climates due to the penguins' phenotypic plasticity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x/abstract|journal = Global Change Biology|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1365-2486|pages = 1618–1630|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x|first = Jaume|last = Forcada|first2 = Philip N.|last2 = Trathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are predicted to respond by dispersal, not adaptation this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is explained due to their long life spans and slow microevolution. Penguins in the subantarctic have very different foraging behavior than the subtropical waters, it would be very hard to survive and keep up with the fast changing climate because these behaviors took years to shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dispersal barriers ===

A dispersal barrier may mean that the dispersal range of a species is much smaller than the species distribution. An artificial example is [[habitat fragmentation]] due to human land use. Natural barriers to dispersal that limit species distribution include mountain ranges and rivers. An example is the separation of the ranges of the two species of [[chimpanzee]] by the [[Congo River]].

On the other hand, human activities may also expand the dispersal range of a species by providing new dispersal methods (e.g., [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|ships]]). Many of them become [[invasive species|invasive]], like [[rat]]s and [[stinkbugs]], but some species also have a slightly positive effect to human settlers like [[honeybees]] and [[earthworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/jamestown/charles-mann-text/2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal mechanisms ==

Most [[animal]]s are capable of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and the basic mechanism of dispersal is movement from one place to another. Locomotion allows the organism to "test" new environments for their suitability, provided they are within the animal's range. Movements are usually guided by inherited [[behavior]]s.

The formation of barriers to dispersal or gene flow between adjacent areas can isolate populations on either side of the emerging divide.  The geographic separation and subsequent genetic isolation of portions of an ancestral population can result in speciation.

=== Plant dispersal mechanisms ===
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bur]]s are an example of a seed dispersion mechanism which uses a biotic vector, in this case [[animal]]s with [[fur]].]]
{{Main article|Seed dispersal}}
[[Seed dispersal]] is the movement or transport of [[seed]]s away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of [[dispersal vector]]s to transport their propagules, including both [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.  The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and [[species]] interactions.  There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water and by animals.

=== Animal dispersal mechanisms ===

==== Non-motile animals ====
There are numerous animal forms that are non—motile, such as [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[bryozoan]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[oyster]]s. In common, they are all either [[ocean|marine]] or aquatic. It may seem curious that plants have been so successful at stationary life on land, while animals have not, but the answer lies in the food supply. Plants produce their own food from sunlight and [[carbon dioxide]]—both generally more abundant on land than in water. Animals fixed in place must rely on the surrounding medium to bring food at least close enough to grab, and this occurs in the three-dimensional water environment, but with much less abundance in the atmosphere.

All of the marine and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s whose lives are spent fixed to the bottom (more or less; anemones are capable of getting up and moving to a new location if conditions warrant) produce dispersal units. These may be specialized "buds", or motile sexual reproduction products, or even a sort of alteration of generations as in certain [[cnidaria]].

Corals provide a good example of how sedentary species achieve dispersion. Corals reproduce by releasing sperm and eggs directly into the water. These release events are coordinated by lunar phase in certain warm months, such that all corals of one or many species on a given reef will release on the same single or several consecutive nights. The released eggs are fertilized, and the resulting [[zygote]] develops quickly into a multicellular ''[[planula]]''. This motile stage then attempts to find a suitable substratum for settlement. Most are unsuccessful and die or are fed upon by zooplankton and bottom dwelling predators such as anemones and other corals. However, untold millions are produced, and a few do succeed in locating spots of bare limestone, where they settle and transform by growth into a '''''polyp'''''. All things being favorable, the single polyp grows into a coral head by budding off new polyps to form a colony.

==== Motile animals ====
{{main article|Animal locomotion|Animal migration}}
The majority of all animals are [[Motility|motile]]. Although motile animals can, in theory, disperse themselves by their spontaneous and independent locomotive powers, a great many species utilize the existing kinetic energies in the environment, resulting in passive movement. Dispersal by water currents is especially associated with the physically small inhabitants of marine waters known as [[plankton|zooplankton]]. The term plankton comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]], πλαγκτον, meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".

====Dispersal by dormant stages====
Many animal species, especially freshwater invertebrates, are able to disperse by wind or by transfer with an aid of larger animals (birds, mammals or fishes) as dormant eggs, dormant embryos or, in some cases, dormant adult stages. [[Tardigrades]], some [[rotifers]] and some [[copepods]] are able to withstand desiccation as adult dormant stages. Many other taxa ([[Cladocera]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]], [[Copepoda]] and so on) can disperse as dormant eggs or embryos. Freshwater [[sponges]] usually have special dormant propagules called [[gemmulae]] for such a dispersal. Many kinds of dispersal dormant stages are able to withstand not only desiccation and low and high temperature, but also action of digestive enzymes during their transfer through digestive tracts of birds and other animals, high concentration of salts and many kinds of toxicants. Such dormant-resistant stages made possible the long-distance dispersal from one water body to another and broad distribution ranges of many freshwater animals.

== Quantifying dispersal ==

Dispersal is most commonly quantified either in terms of rate or distance.

Dispersal rate (also called [[Net migration rate|migration rate]] in the [[population genetics]] literature) or probability describes the probability that any individual leaves an area or, equivalently, the expected proportion of individual to leave an area.

The dispersal distance is usually described by a '''dispersal kernel''' which gives the [[probability distribution]] of the distance traveled by any individual. A number of different functions are used for dispersal kernels in theoretical models of dispersal including the [[negative exponential distribution]],&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, D.

== Consequences of dispersal ==
Dispersal not only has costs and benefits to the dispersing individual (as mentioned above), but it also has consequences at the level of the [[population]] and [[species]] as well.

Most populations have a patchy spatial distribution. Dispersal, by moving of individuals between different sub-populations, can increase the overall [[landscape connectivity|connectivity]] of the population, helping to minimize the risk of [[stochastic]] extinction, since if a sub-population goes [[extinct]] by chance, it is likely to be recolonized if the dispersal rate is high.
Increased connectivity can also decrease the degree of local adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenormand, T. |year=2002|title= Gene flow and the limits to natural selection|journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17|issue=4|pages= 183–189|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02497-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:braininvat.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A brain in a vat that believes it is walking]]
In [[philosophy]], the '''brain in a vat''' ('''BIV'''; alternately known as '''brain in a jar''') is a scenario used in a variety of [[thought experiment]]s intended to draw out certain features of human conceptions of [[knowledge]], [[reality]], [[truth]], [[mind]], [[consciousness]], and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. It is an updated version of [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]] thought experiment originated by [[Gilbert Harman]].&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Gilbert 1973: Thought, Princeton/NJ, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Common to many science fiction stories, it outlines a scenario in which a [[mad scientist]], machine, or other entity might remove a person's brain from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and [[brain-computer interface|connect its neurons by wires]] to a [[supercomputer]] which would provide it with [[action potential|electrical impulses]] identical to those the brain normally receives.&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putnam|first1=Hilary|authorlink=Hilary Putnam|title=Brains in a Vat|url=https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/Brains%20in%20a%20Vat%20-%20Hilary%20Putnam.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to such stories, the computer would then be [[simulated reality|simulating reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the "disembodied" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences, such as those of a person with an embodied brain, without these being related to objects or events in the real world.

==Uses==
The simplest use of brain-in-a-vat scenarios is as an [[argument]] for [[philosophical skepticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Klein |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter D. Klein |title=Skepticism |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/ |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solipsism]]. A simple version of this runs as follows: Since the brain in a vat gives and receives exactly the same impulses as it would if it were in a skull, and since these are its only way of interacting with its environment, then it is not possible to tell, ''from the perspective of that brain'', whether it is in a skull or a vat. Yet in the first case most of the person's beliefs may be true (if they believe, say, that they are walking down the street, or eating ice-cream); in the latter case their beliefs are false. Since the argument says one cannot know whether one is a brain in a vat, then one cannot know whether most of one's beliefs might be completely false. Since, in principle, it is impossible to rule out oneself being a brain in a vat, there cannot be good grounds for believing any of the things one believes; a skeptical argument would contend that one certainly cannot ''know'' them, raising issues with the [[epistemology|definition of knowledge]].

The brain in a vat is a contemporary version of the argument given in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Maya (illusion)|Maya illusion]], [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi (book)#"The Butterfly Dream"|Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", and the [[evil demon]] in [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

Brain-in-a-vat scenarios—or closely related scenarios in which the protagonist is in a [[virtual reality]] simulation and unaware of this fact—have also been used for purposes other than skeptical arguments.  For example, Vincent Conitzer uses such a scenario to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.)  That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine his [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in a VR simulation that he has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation he is watching.  Could he not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

== Philosophical debates ==
While the disembodied brain (the brain in a vat) can be seen as a helpful thought experiment, there are several philosophical debates surrounding the plausibility of the thought experiment. If these debates conclude that the thought experiment is implausible, a possible consequence would be that we are no closer to knowledge, truth, consciousness, representation, etc. than we were prior to the experiment.

=== Argument from biology ===
One argument against the BIV thought experiment derives from the idea that the BIV is not  and cannot be biologically similar to that of an embodied brain (that is, a brain found in a person). Since the BIV is ''dis''embodied, it follows that it does not have a similar biology to that of an embodied brain. That is, the BIV lacks the connections from the body to the brain, which renders the BIV neither [[Neuroanatomy|neuroanatomically]] nor [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologically]] similar to that of an embodied brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HEYABI |title=A Brain in a Vat Cannot Break Out:  Why the Singularity Must be Extended, Embedded, and Embodied |last=Heylighen |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Heylighen |date=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]] |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=126-142 |doi = |pmid = |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/521450 |title=Brain in a Vat or Body in a World? Brainbound versus Enactive Views of Experience|last=Thompson |first=Evan |authorlink=Evan Thompson |last2=Cosmelli |first2=Diego |date=Spring 2011 |journal=[[Philosophical Topics]] |publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=163-180}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, we cannot say that it is even possible for the BIV to have similar experiences to the embodied brain, since the brains are not equal.

=== Argument from externalism ===
A second argument deals directly with the stimuli coming into the brain. This is often referred to as the account from [[externalism]] or ultra-externalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consciousness, Information and External Relations|last = Kirk|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Communication and Cognition |volume=30 |issue=3–4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the BIV, the brain receives stimuli from a machine. In an embodied brain, however, the brain receives the stimuli from the sensors found in the body (via touching, tasting, smelling, etc.) which receive their input from the external environment. This argument oftentimes leads to the conclusion that there is a difference between what the BIV is representing and what the embodied brain is representing. This debate has been hashed out, but remains unresolved, by several philosophers including Uriah Kriegel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 180–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin McGinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consciousness and Content|last = McGinn|first = Colin|date = 1988|journal = Proceedings of the British Academy |volume=76|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 219–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Rupert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sufficiency of Objective Representation|last = Rupert|first = Robert|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 180–95|work = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate has ramifications for [[philosophy of mind]] discussions on (but not limited to) [[Mental representation|representation]], [[consciousness]], content, [[cognition]], and [[embodied cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = When Is Cognition Embodied|last = Shapiro|first = Lawrence|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 73–90|work = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5174">In popular culture, the '''Bro Code''' is a friendship [[etiquette]] to be followed among men or, more specifically, among members of the [[Bro (subculture)|bro subculture]]. The term has been popularized by [[Barney Stinson]], a character from the television show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''. Katherine Connor Martin, head of content creation at [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], recognized Stinson as "the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |title=The rise of the portmanbro |last1=Martin |first1=Katherine Connor |date=October 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oc7U2FBb?url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==The notion==

=== Early references ===
The notion of an unwritten set of rules that govern the relationship between male friends is present in popular culture at least since 1991. In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Stranded]]", which aired on November 27 that year, Jerry Seinfeld says the following monologue, in one of his stand-up bits:

{{Quote|text=All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  '''This is the male code'''.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are [...]|source="The Stranded"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheStranded.html|title=The Stranded|publisher=SeinfeldScripts|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=Jerry Seinfeld|title=''Seinfeld''}}

=== "Bros before hoes" ===
"[[wikt:bros before hoes|Bros before hoes]]" (that is, "friends before women") is a well-known, vulgar slang expression about how men should not abandon their male friends in order to pursue or embark on relationships with women.

The "bros before hoes" expression is often regarded as the "golden rule" of male friendship, and it has been common slang at least since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/bros-before-hoes|title=What does bros before hoes mean? bros before hoes Definition. Meaning of bros before hoes. |publisher=OnlineSlangDictionary.com |access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] in "[[A Benihana Christmas]]", and was later popularized by Barney Stinson.

It is essentially the opposite of veganism."&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;}} Carnism is presented as a dominant belief system supported by a variety of [[defense mechanisms]] and mostly unchallenged assumptions.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeMello2012p138&gt;{{cite book | title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies | publisher=New York: Columbia University Press | author=DeMello, Margo | year=2012 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=92Ct9iD1QTYC&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhont, Kristof; Hodson, Gordon (2014).

Central to the ideology, according to the theory, is the acceptance of meat-eating as "natural", "normal", "necessary", and (sometimes) "nice".{{refn|group=n|Joy introduced the "Three Ns of Justification", namely that meat-eating is regarded as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name=Joy2011p96&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 paper developed this into the "Four Ns": "natural, normal, necessary, and nice".&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015"&gt;Singal, Jesse (4 June 2015).

This classification is culturally relative, so that, for example, dogs are eaten by some people in Korea but may be pets in the West, while cows are eaten in the West but [[Cattle in religion|protected]] in much of India.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Ethics of eating meat|History of vegetarianism}}

Analyzing the history of vegetarianism and opposition to it from ancient Greece to the present day, literary scholar Renan Larue found certain commonalities in what he described as carnist arguments. According to him, carnists typically held that vegetarianism is a ludicrous idea unworthy of attention, that mankind is invested with dominion over animals by divine authority, and that abstaining from violence against animals would pose a threat to humans. He found that the views that farmed animals do not suffer, and that slaughter is preferable to death by disease or predation, gained currency in the nineteenth century, but that the former had precedent in the writings of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], a vegetarian who advocated the humane production of animal products which do not require animals to be slaughtered, such as wool.&lt;ref name="Desaulniers30Jan2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://penseravantdouvrirlabouche.com/2015/01/30/le-vegetarisme-et-ses-ennemis-entrevue-avec-renan-larue/ | title=Le végétarisme et ses ennemis: entrevue avec Renan Larue | date=30 January 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=[[Élise Desaulniers|Desaulniers, Élise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s traditional views on the moral standing of animals were challenged by [[animal rights]] advocates, including psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]], who in 1971 introduced the notion of [[speciesism]]. This is defined as the assignment of value and rights to individuals solely on the basis of their [[species]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] (1971).

{{quote|We don't see meat eating as we do vegetarianism&amp;nbsp;– as a choice, based on a set of assumptions about animals, our world, and ourselves. Rather, we see it as a given, the "natural" thing to do, the way things have always been and the way things will always be. We eat animals without thinking about what we are doing and why, because the belief system that underlies this behavior is invisible. This invisible belief system is what I call ''carnism''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011p9" /&gt;}}

Sandra Mahlke argues that carnism is the "central crux of speciesism" because the eating of meat motivates ideological justification for other forms of animal exploitation.&lt;ref name="Mahle2014"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6hPAwAAQBAJ | title=Das Machtverhältnis zwischen Mensch und Tier im Kontext sprachlicher Distanzierungsmechanismen: Anthropozentrismus, Speziesismus und Karnismus in der kritischen Diskursanalyse | publisher=Diplomica Verlag | author=Mahlke, Sandra | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-8428-9140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central aspect of carnism is that animals are categorized as edible, inedible, pets, [[vermin]], predators, or entertainment animals, according to people's [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] – mental classifications that determine, and are determined by, our beliefs and desires.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joy2011pp14,17" /&gt; There is cultural variability regarding which animals count as food. Dogs are eaten in China, and South Korea, but elsewhere are not viewed as food, either because they are loved or, as in the Middle East and parts of India, regarded as unclean.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Podberscek2009" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Hal (2011).

===Meat paradox===
{{main|Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox}}
Jeff Mannes writes that carnism is rooted in a paradox between most people's values and actions: they oppose harming animals, and yet eat them. He argues that this conflict leads to [[cognitive dissonance]], which people attempt to attenuate through [[psychic numbing]].&lt;ref name="Mannes2015"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-2232-4/lexikon-der-mensch-tier-beziehungen | title=Lexikon der Mensch-Tier-Beziehungen | chapter = Karnismus | publisher=Transcript Verlag | author=Mannes, Jeff| year=2015 | pages=191–193 | isbn=978-3-8376-2232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent conflict between caring about animals and embracing diets which require them to be harmed has been termed the "[[Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox|meat paradox]]".&lt;ref name=Loughnan2014&gt;Loughnan, Steve; Bastian, Brock; Haslam, Nick (2014).

There is experimental evidence supporting the idea that the meat paradox induces cognitive dissonance in Westerners.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothgerber2014"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Efforts to overcome vegetarian-induced dissonance among meat eaters | author=Rothgerber, Hank | journal=Appetite |date=August 2014  | volume=79 | pages=32–41 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Gordon (3 March 2014). [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/without-prejudice/201403/the-meat-paradox-loving-exploiting-animals "The Meat Paradox: Loving but Exploiting Animals"], ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; Westerners are more willing to eat animals which they regard as having lesser mental capacities and moral standing, and conversely, to attribute lesser mental faculties and moral standing to animals which are eaten.&lt;ref name="Loughnan2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bastian2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www2.psy.uq.edu.au/~uqbbast1/Bastian%20et%20al%20PSPB%20in%20press.pdf|doi=10.1177/0146167211424291 | title=Don’t mind meat?

{{anchor|4 Ns}}&lt;!-- Linked to by [[Psychology of eating meat]]. This should appear directly before the section currently titled "Justification" which discusses the 4 N's"--&gt;

===Justification===
Joy introduced the idea of the "Three Ns of Justification", writing that meat-eaters regard [[meat consumption]] as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name="Joy2011p96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt; She argues that the "Three Ns" have been invoked to justify other ideologies, including slavery and denying women the right to vote, and are widely recognized as problematic only after the ideology they support has been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument holds that people are conditioned to believe that humans evolved to eat meat, that it is expected of them, and that they need it to survive or be strong. These beliefs are said to be reinforced by various institutions, including religion, family and the media. Although scientists have shown that humans get more than enough protein in their diets without eating meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/ | title = Do vegetarians get enough protein? | first1 = Michael | last1 = Greger | date = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that meat is required persists.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt;

Building on Joy's work, psychologists conducted a series of studies in the United States and Australia, published in 2015, that found the great majority of meat-eaters' stated justifications for consuming meat were based on the "Four Ns"&amp;nbsp;– "natural, normal, necessary, and nice". The arguments were that humans are [[omnivore]]s (''natural''), that most people eat meat (''normal''), that vegetarian diets are lacking in nutrients (''necessary''), and that meat tastes good (''nice'').&lt;ref name="Piazza2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rationalizing meat consumption. The 4Ns | author=Piazza, Jared| journal=Appetite |date=August 2015  | volume=91 | pages=114–128 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.011|display-authors=etal | pmid=25865663}}{{paragraph break}}

Meat-eaters who endorsed these arguments more strongly reported less guilt about their dietary habits. They tended to objectify animals, have less moral concern for them and attribute less consciousness to them. They were also more supportive of [[social inequality]] and hierarchical ideologies, and less proud of their consumer choices.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;

==="Saved from slaughter" narratives===
[[File:Obama ThanksGiving Turkey Pardon 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]], in which the American president pardons a turkey, has been cited as an illustration of carnism.&lt;ref name="Freeman2012p103" /&gt;]]

An illustration of dissonance reduction is the prominence given to "saved from slaughter" stories, in which the media focus on one animal that evaded slaughter, while ignoring the millions that did not.&lt;ref name="Mizelle2015p264" /&gt; Joy wrote that this dichotomy is characteristic of carnism.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, pp. 135,150&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals at the center of these narratives include Wilbur in ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' (1952); the eponymous and fictional star of ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995); Christopher Hogwood in [[Sy Montgomery]]'s ''The Good, Good Pig'' (2006);&lt;ref name=Mizelle2015p264&gt;Mizelle, Brett (2015).

'''Causation in Sciences Project''' ('''CauSci''') is a 4-year interdisciplinary research project on the field of [[Causality|causation]] in the [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]], funded by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] (NFR) and hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073703/http://www.umb.no/ior-en School of Economics and Business] at the [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] (NMBU).

[[Causality]] is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is [[Philosophy|philosophers]] who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.

[http://www.umb.no/causci/article/about-causci CauSci] is based on a [[Disposition (philosophy)|dispositional]] theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as [[Event (philosophy)|event]] that disposes towards an [[result|effect or outcome]]. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely [[Reductionism]] versus [[holism]] in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of [[Subatomic particle|subatomic particles.]] But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers’ fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new [[causality|causal powers]] emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified.

The project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/people Norwegian and international] researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.

== Methodology ==
The methodological basis of the project is that [[philosophy]] should not dictate to [[science]] and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and [[empirically]] satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete.

Four central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the [http://www.umb.no/causci/article/causal-dispositionalism causal dispositionalist] hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.

The '''Celtiberian script''' is a [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic script]] that was the main [[writing system]] of the [[Celtiberian language]], an extinct [[Continental Celtic]] language, which was also occasionally written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. This script is a direct adaptation of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the most frequently used of the [[Iberian scripts]].

==Origins==
All the [[Paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the [[stop consonant]]s, and monophonemic values for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. They are thus to be classed as neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] was also involved.

==Tipology and variants==
The basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 [[sign (linguistics)|signs]] rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the [[northeastern Iberian script]], since the [[Celtiberians]] omitted one of the two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and one of the three [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 [[vowel]]s, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian ''s'' is transcribed as ''z'' in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (''d''), while the Iberian sign ''ś'' is transcribed as ''s''. As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''ḿ'', while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''m''. This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence{{which|date=March 2014}} of having allowed the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ''g'' and ''d'' to be differentiated from their respective [[voicelessness|voiceless]] counterparts, ''k'' and ''t'', by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (''p:b, t:d'' and ''k:g'').

==Location of findings==
The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the [[Ebro]] valley and near the sources of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] rivers, where [[ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], [[ceramic]] receptacles, [[bronze]] plaques and [[tessera]]s, [[amphora|amphores]], stones, [[spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorls]], etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third [[Botorrita]] bronze plaque ([[Zaragoza]]) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.

'''Civic virtue''' is the cultivation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]] important for the success of the community. Closely linked to the concept of [[citizenship]], civic [[virtue]] is often conceived as the dedication of citizens to the common welfare of their community even at the cost of their individual interests. The identification of the character traits that constitute civic virtue has been a major concern of [[political philosophy]]. The term ''civility'' refers to [[behavior]] between persons and groups that conforms to a [[society|social]] mode (that is, in accordance with the [[civil society]]), as itself being a foundational [[principle]] of society and [[law]].

==In republics==
Civic virtues have historically taught as a matter of chief concern in nations under [[republic]]an forms of government, and societies with [[cities]]. When final decisions on public matters are made by a [[monarch]], it is the ''monarch's'' virtues which influence those decisions. When a broader class of people become the decision-makers, it is then their virtues which characterize the types of decisions made. This form of decision-making is considered superior in determining what best protects the interests of the majority. [[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] [[oligarchies]] may also develop traditions of public lists of virtues they believe appropriate in the governing class, but these virtues differ significantly from those who are generally identified under the category of civic virtue, stressing [[war|martial]] [[courage]] over [[commerce|commercial]] [[honesty]]. [[Constitution]]s became important in defining the public virtue of republics and constitutional monarchies. The earliest forms of constitutional development can be seen in late medieval Germany (see [[Communalism before 1800]]) and in the Dutch and English revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries.

===In ancient Greece and Rome===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
{{See also|Arete (moral virtue)|Virtus (virtue)}}
In the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture of [[Western Europe]] and those places that follow its political tradition, concern for civic virtue starts with the oldest republics of which we have extensive records, [[Athens]] and [[Rome]]. Attempting to define the virtues needed to successfully govern the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was a matter of significant concern for [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]; a difference in civic vision ultimately was one of the [[wikt:factor|factor]]s that led to the [[trial of Socrates]] and his conflict with the Athenian [[democracy]]. The '' [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] viewed [[citizenship]] as consisting, not of political [[rights]], but rather of political [[duties]]. Citizens were expected to put their private lives and interests aside and serve the [[State (polity)|state]] in accordance with duties defined by law.

Rome, even more than [[ancient Greece|Greece]], produced a number of moralistic philosophers such as [[Cicero]], and moralistic [[historiography|historians]] such as [[Tacitus]], [[Sallust]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Livy]]. Many of these figures were either personally involved in power struggles that took place in the late [[Roman Republic]], or wrote elegies to [[liberty]] which was lost during their transition to the [[Roman Empire]]. They tended to blame this loss of liberty on the perceived lack of civic virtue in their contemporaries, contrasting them with idealistic examples of virtue drawn from Roman history, and even non-Roman "[[barbarian]]s".

===During the Medieval Age and the Renaissance===
Texts of antiquity became very popular by the [[Renaissance]]. Scholars tried to gather as many of them as they could find, especially in monasteries, from Constantinople, and from the Muslim world. Aided by the rediscovery of the [[virtue ethics]] and [[metaphysics]] of [[Aristotle]] by [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] fused [[Aristotle]]'s [[cardinal virtue]]s with [[Christianity]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (1273).

[[Humanism|Humanists]] wanted to reinstate the ancient ideal of civic virtue through education. Instead of punishing sinners, it was believed that sin could be prevented by raising virtuous children. Living in the city became important for the elite, because people in the city are forced to behave themselves when communicating with others. A problem was that the [[Proletariat|proletarianization]] of peasants created an environment in cities where such workers were hard to control. Cities tried to keep the proletarians out or tried to civilize them by forcing them to work in poor houses. Important aspects of civic virtue were: civic conversation (listening to others, trying to reach an agreement, keeping yourself informed so you can have a relevant contribution), civilized behavior (decent clothing, accent, containing feelings and needs), work (people had to make a useful contribution to the society). Religion changed. It became more focused on individual behavior instead of a communion of people. The people who believed in civic virtue belonged to a small majority surrounded by "barbarity". Parental authority was popular, especially the authority of the monarch and the state.&lt;ref&gt;John Hale, ''The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance'' (London 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Enlightenment ===
Civic virtue was very popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] but it had changed dramatically. Parental authority began to wane. Freedom became popular. But people can only be free by containing their emotions in order to keep some space for others. Trying to keep proletarians out or putting them in a poor house was not done anymore. The focus was now on educating. Work was an important virtue during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the people who worked were treated with contempt by the non-working elite. The 18th century brought an end to this. The advancing rich merchants class emphasized the importance of work and contributing to society for all people including the elite. Science was popular. The government and the elites tried to change the world and humanity positively by expanding the bureaucracy. Leading thinkers thought that education and the breach of barriers would liberate everybody from stupidity and oppression. Civic conversations were held in societies and scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche, ''La France des Lumières'' (Paris 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the republican revolutions of the 18th century===
Civic virtue also became a matter of public interest and discussion during the 18th century, in part because of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. An [[anecdote]] first published in 1906 has [[Benjamin Franklin]] answer a woman who asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got&amp;nbsp;– a Republic or a Monarchy?" He responded: "A Republic, if you can keep it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/1593.html 1593. Benjamin Franklin (1706–90). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current use for this quotation is to bolster with Franklin's authority the opinion that republics require the cultivation of specific political beliefs, interests, and habits among their citizens, and that if those habits are not cultivated, they are in danger of falling back into some sort of authoritarian rule, such as a monarchy.

American historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] called it a universal 18th-century assumption that, while no form of government was more beautiful than a republic, monarchies had various advantages: the pomp and circumstances surrounding them cultivated a sense that the rulers were in fact superior to the ruled and entitled to their obedience, and maintained order by their presence. By contrast, in a republic, the rulers were the servants of the public, and there could therefore be no sustained coercion from them. Laws had to be obeyed for the sake of conscience, rather than fear of the ruler's wrath.  In a monarchy, people might be restrained by force to submit their own interest to their government's. In a republic, by contrast, people must be ''persuaded'' to submit their own interests to the government, and this voluntary submission constituted the 18th century's notion of civic virtue. In the absence of such persuasion, the authority of the government would collapse, and [[tyranny]] or [[Anomie|anarchy]] were imminent.

Authority for this ideal was found once more among the classical, and especially the Roman, political authors and historians. But since the Roman writers wrote during a time when the Roman republican ideal was fading away, its forms but not its spirit or substance being preserved in the Roman Empire, the 18th-century American and [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]] read them with a spirit to determine how the Roman republic failed, and how to avoid repeating that failure. In his ''Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republicks'', the [[England|English]] [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Whig history|historian]] [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward Wortley Montagu]] sought to describe "the principal causes of that degeneracy of manners, which reduc'd those once brave and free people into the most abject slavery." Following this reading of Roman ideals, the American revolutionary [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] envisioned a [[Sparta]]n, [[egalitarian]] society where every man was a [[soldier]] and master of his own land, and where people were "instructed from early infancy to deem themselves property of the State.... (and) were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests." The [[agrarianism]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]] represents a similar belief system; Jefferson believed that the ideal republic was composed of independent, [[rural]] [[agriculturalists]] rather than [[city|urban]] [[Tradesman|tradesmen]].

[[File:MacMonnies' Civic Virtue 1922.JPG|thumb|[[Civic Virtue (sculpture)|Civic Virtue]], 1919]]
These widely held ideals led American revolutionaries to found institutions such as the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], named after the Roman [[farmer]] and [[dictator]] [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], who according to Livy left his farm to lead the army of the Roman republic during a crisis, and voluntarily returned to his plow once the crisis had passed. About Cincinnatus, Livy writes:
{{quote|''Operae pretium est audire qui omnia prae diuitiis humana spernunt neque honori magno locum neque uirtuti putant esse, nisi ubi effuse afluant opes....''&lt;br&gt;(It is worth while for those who disdain all human things for money, and who suppose that there is no room either for great honor or virtue, except where wealth is found, to listen to his story.)|Livy|''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', book III.}}

===19th to mid-20th century===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
Civic virtues were especially important during the 19th and 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Class and profession greatly affected the virtues of the individual, and there was a general division about what the best civic virtues were. Additionally several major [[ideologies]] came into being, each with their own ideas about civic virtues.

[[Conservatism]] emphasized family values and obedience to the father and the state. [[Nationalism]] carried by masses of people made [[patriotism]] an important civic virtue. [[Liberalism]] combined republicanism with a belief in progress and liberalization based on [[capitalism]]. Civic virtues focused on individual behavior and responsibility were very important. Many liberals turned into socialists or conservatives in the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Others became social liberals, valuing capitalism with a strong government to protect the poor. A focus on agriculture and [[landed nobility]] was supplanted by a focus on industry and civil society.

An important civic virtue for [[socialist]]s was that people be conscious of oppression within society and the forces which uphold the status quo. This consciousness should result in action to change the world for the good, so that everybody can become respectful citizens in a modern society.

[[National Socialism]], the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the ideal nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which had different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on those males of pure racial stock who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. Only women who worked independently or who married a citizen could obtain citizenship for themselves. The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights:

{{Quote|text=''"The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

[...]The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State."''|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=[[Mein Kampf]] Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

===In later times===
[[File:Cover of McGuffey's First Eclectic Reader.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|The cover of an ''[[McGuffey Readers|Eclectic First Reader]]'' [[book]].]]
A number of institutions and organizations promote the idea of civic virtue in the older democracies. Among such organizations are the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and [[Civil Air Patrol]] whose U.S. [[oath]], Cadet Oath and Cadet Honor Code reflect a goal to foster habits aimed at serving a larger community:

Boy Scouts of America Scout Oath:
{{quote|''On my honor I will do my best&lt;br&gt;To do my duty to God and my country&lt;br&gt;and to obey the Scout Law;&lt;br&gt;To help other people at all times;&lt;br&gt;To keep myself physically strong,&lt;br&gt;mentally awake, and morally straight.''}}


Boy Scouts of America Scout Law:
{{quote|''A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.''}}

Cadet Oath:
{{quote|''I pledge that I will serve faithfully in the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, and that I will attend meetings regularly, participate actively in unit activities, obey my officers, wear my uniform properly, and advance my education and training rapidly to prepare myself to be of service to my community, state and nation.''}}

Air Force Academy Cadet Honor Code:

Institutions that might be said to encourage civic virtue include the [[school]], particularly with [[social studies]] courses, and the [[prison]], namely in its [[Penology|rehabilitative]] function.

Other, later phenomena associated with the concept of civic virtue include ''[[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's Eclectic Readers]]'', a series of [[primary education|primary school]] [[textbook]]s whose compiler, [[William Holmes McGuffey]], deliberately sought out patriotic and religious sentiments to instill these values in the children who read them. [[William Bennett]], a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration cabinet member turned [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator, produced ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' in 1993, another [[anthology]] of literary materials that might be considered an attempt to update McGuffey's concept.

==Comparable ideas in non-Western societies==
[[Confucianism]], which specifies cultural virtues and traditions which all members of society are to observe, in particular the heads of households and those who govern, was the basis of Chinese society for more than 2000 years and is still influential in modern China. Its related concepts can be compared to the Western idea of civic virtue.

==Related concepts==
;Friendliness
:Friendliness is a [[pro-social]] set of behaviors seen in people who are pleasant, agreeable, interested in others, genial, empathetic, considerate, and helpful.  Not all civil behaviors are friendly.  For example, [[duelling]] in response to an intolerable insult has been considered a civil behavior in many cultures, but it is not a friendly action.
;[[Politeness]]
:Politeness focuses on the application of good manners or [[etiquette]].  Because politeness is informed by cultural values, there is substantial overlap between what is polite and what is civil.  However, if the action in question is not related to civic virtues, then it may be polite or rude, without strictly being considered civil or incivil.
;[[Social graces]]
:The social graces include [[deportment]], [[Gracefulness|poise]], and [[fashion]], which are unrelated to civility.
;[[Incivility]]
:Incivility is a general term for social behavior lacking in civic virtue or good [[manners]], on a scale from [[rude]]ness or lack of [[respect]] for elders, to [[vandalism]] and [[hooliganism]], through [[public intoxication|public drunkenness]] and threatening behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=incivility&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact |work=[[AskOxford]] |title=Definition of 'Incivility{{'-}} |accessdate=2006-11-25}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''incivility'' is derived from the Latin ''incivilis'', meaning "not of a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Soanes |editor-first=Catherine |editor2-last=Stevenson |editor2-first=Angus |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English (revised edition) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of "civility" as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of civic virtue or civil society. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |url=http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |work=[InDC Journal] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''closed-household economy''' is a society's [[economic system]] in which goods are not traded. Instead, those goods are produced and consumed by the same households. In other words, a closed-household economy is an economy where households are closed to [[Trade|trading]]. This kind of economy is present, for example, in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.

The production and consumption of goods is not separated as in a society with high [[division of labor]].

The closed-household economy contrasts with a [[barter economy]], in which goods are bartered (traded against each other), and a [[monetary economy]], in which goods are traded for money.

The closed-household economy and the barter economy are together referred to as ''non-monetary economies''.

{{LGBT sidebar|culture}}

'''Coming out of the closet''', or simply '''coming out''', is a [[metaphor]] for [[LGBT]] people's [[self-disclosure]] of their [[sexual orientation]] or of their [[gender identity]]. The term ''coming out'' can also be used in various non-LGBT applications (e.g. [[atheists]]).

Framed and debated as a [[privacy]] issue, coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey;&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825202112/http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[decision-making]] or [[Risk|risk-taking]]; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a [[speech act]] and a matter of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]; a [[rite of passage]]; [[liberty|liberation]] or [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]]; an [[wikt:ordeal|ordeal]];&lt;ref&gt;''Belfast Telegraph'': [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/gaa-star-donal-og-cusack-teammates-helped-me-through-ordeal-of-revealing-i-am-gay-14536491.html "GAA star Donal Og Cusack: Teammates helped me through ordeal of revealing I am gay," October 20, 2009], accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a means toward feeling [[gay pride]] instead of [[shame]] and [[social stigma]]; or even career suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Queerty: [http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ Japhy Grant, "Rupert Everett Says Coming Out Killed His Career," February 20, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015003811/http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ |date=October 15, 2010 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Steven Seidman]] writes that "it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal, social, and political drama in twentieth-century America".&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Steven (2003). ''Beyond the Closet; The Transformation of Gay and Lesbian Life'', 25, {{ISBN|0-415-93207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argues that the process of  "coming out" does not free gay people from oppression. Although they may feel free to act as themselves, the opacity involved in entering a non-heterosexual territory insinuates judgment upon their identity, she argues in ''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1991).

''Coming out of the closet'' is the source of other [[gay slang]] expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are ''out'', i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as [[Closeted|closeted or being in the closet]]. [[Outing]] is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, ''outing oneself'' is self-disclosure. ''Glass closet'' means the [[open secret]] of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out.&lt;ref&gt;''OUT'' magazine: [http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet Michael Musto, "The Glass Closet," September 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705232840/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet |date=July 5, 2012 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of LGBT history}}
[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs.jpg|thumb|19th-century gay rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of coming out as a means of emancipation.]]
In 1869, one hundred years before the [[Stonewall riots]], the German homosexual rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of self-disclosure as a means of [[emancipation]]. Claiming that invisibility was a major obstacle toward changing [[public opinion]], he urged homosexual people to reveal their same-sex attractions. In his 1906 work, ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'' (''The Sexual Life of Our Time in its Relation to Modern Civilization''),&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Ivan. ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'', 1906. English translation: ''The Sexual Life of Our Time in Its Relations to Modern Civilization'', 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwan Bloch]], a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. In 1914, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] revisited the topic in his major work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', discussing the social and legal potentials of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson&amp;Percy, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine ''Politics'', he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 "Robert Duncan and Romantic Synthesis: A Few Notes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906020604/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 |date=2010-09-06 }}. This article also republished as "On Robert Duncan" at Modern American Poetry website&lt;/ref&gt; The decidedly clandestine [[Mattachine Society]], founded by [[Harry Hay]] and other veterans of the [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace for President]] campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging from the closet.

In 1951, [[Donald Webster Cory]]&lt;ref name=sagarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html|title=Donald Webster Cory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |publisher= [[glbtq.com]]|author=|date=|website=glbtq.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |title=Sagarin bio |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=1913-09-18 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published his landmark ''The Homosexual in America'', exclaiming, "Society has handed me a mask to wear...Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend." Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent [[homophile]] movement.

In the 1960s, [[Frank Kameny]] came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service in 1957 for homosexual behavior, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, "we must instill in the [[LGBT community|homosexual community]] a sense of worth to the individual homosexual", which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves.
With the spread of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the [[gay liberation]] movement to raise [[political consciousness]] to counter heterosexism and homophobia. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian [[social support]] discussion groups, some of which were called "coming-out groups", focused on sharing coming-out "stories" (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and [[Gay pride|pride]].

== Sociolinguistic origin ==
The present-day expression "coming out" is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an [[analogy]] that likens homosexuals' introduction into [[gay subculture]] to a [[débutante]]'s ''coming-out party.'' This is a celebration for a young [[upper-class]] woman who is making her début&amp;nbsp;– her formal presentation to society&amp;nbsp;– because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian [[George Chauncey]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]... did not speak of coming out of what we call the gay closet but rather of coming out ''into'' what they called homosexual society or the gay world, a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor... so hidden as closet implies&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey, George (1994). ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. New York: Basic Books, emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, "using the term 'closet' to refer to" previous times such as "the 1920s and 1930s might be [[anachronism|anachronistic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Elizabeth. "'But We Would Never Talk about It': The Structure of Lesbian Discretion in South Dakota, 1928–1933" in ''Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America'', ed. Ellen Lewin (1996). Boston: Beacon Press. p.25 and 214&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on coming out&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|title=Coming Out, accessed on Aug 31, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014140942/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the online encyclopedia [[glbtq.com]] states that [[sexologist]] [[Evelyn Hooker]]'s observations introduced the use of "coming out" to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in [[connotation]] occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on ''entrance'' into "a new world of hope and communal solidarity" whereas the post-[[Stonewall Riots]] overtone was an ''exit'' from the oppression of the closet.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; This change in focus suggests that "coming out ''of the closet''" is a [[mixed metaphor]] that joins "coming out" with the [[Coming out#Closeted|closet]] metaphor: an evolution of "[[wikt:skeleton in the closet|skeleton in the closet]]" specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's [[sexual orientation]]. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.

== Identity issues ==
{{See also|Identity (social science)|Personal identity}}

When coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey,&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"/&gt; it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's gender identity or non-heteronormative sexual orientation. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|title=Gay Epiphany|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014093757/http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often called "coming out to oneself" and constitutes the start of [[self-acceptance]]. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during [[adolescence]] or [[childhood]], when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are [[Heterosexism|assumed to be heterosexual]] or [[cisgender]], such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time".

=== LGBT identity development ===
{{Main|Sexual identity#Models of sexual identity development}}
Every coming out story is the person trying to come to terms with who they are and their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chirrey|first=Deborah|title=I Hereby Come Out: What Sort Of Speech Act Is Coming Out?|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–37|doi=10.1111/1467-9481.00209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the [[Cass identity model]] established by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325110617/http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.&lt;ref&gt;Salon: [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/24/gay_teens/ Amy Benfer, "We're here! We're queer!

Emerging research suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While further research is needed to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2015). Online Coming Out Communications between Gay Men and their Religious Family Allies: A Family of Choice and Origin Perspective, Journal of GLBT Family Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender and transsexual communities ===
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

== Legal issues ==
{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}

In areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute [[self-incrimination]]. These laws still exist in 76 countries worldwide, including Egypt, Iran, Singapore, and Afghanistan.

== Effects ==
In the early stages of the lesbian, gay or bisexual identity development process, people feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''[[Queer in America]]'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.&lt;ref&gt;re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because LGBT people have historically been marginalized as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] of [[heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and [[homophobic]] [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].

On the personal and relationship levels, effects of not coming out have been the subject of studies. For example, it has been found that same-sex couples who have not come out are not as satisfied in their relationships as same-sex couples who have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2392712 |year=1990 |last1=Berger |first1=RM |title=Passing: Impact on the quality of same-sex couple relationships |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=328–32 |journal=Social work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the relational bond between parents and children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between children and their parents may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Nielsen|title=Father-Daughter Relationships: Contemporary Research and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0BLxVDTpOoC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-933-9|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people coming out are accepted by their parents, this allows open discussions of dating and relationships and allows parents to help their children with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="LamannaRiedmann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Lamanna|author2=Agnes Riedmann|author3=Ann Strahm|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heu0KLoVVnMC&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30154-5|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have been done on the effect of people coming out to their parents. A 1989 report by Robinson et al. of parents of out gay and lesbian children in the United States found that 21% of fathers and 28% of mothers had suspected that their child was gay or lesbian, largely based on gender atypical behaviour during childhood. The 1989 study found that two-thirds of parents reacted negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=BE|author2=Walters, LH |author3=Skeen, P |title=Response of parents to learning that their child is homosexual and concern over AIDS: a national study.|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1989|volume=18|issue=1-2|pages=59–80|pmid=2794499|doi=10.1300/j082v18n01_03}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study (that used young people's reactions) found that half of the mothers of gay or bisexual male college students "responded with disbelief, denial or negative comments" while fathers reacted slightly better. 18% of parents reacted "with acts of intolerance, attempts to convert the child to heterosexuality, and verbal threats to cut off financial or emotional support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savin-Williams|first=Ritch|author2=Eric M.

Homelessness is a common effect among LGBT youth during the coming out process. LGBT youth are among the largest population of homeless youth; this has typically been caused by the self-identification and acknowledgment of being gay or identifying with the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tierney|first=William G.|last2=Ward|first2=James Dean|date=2017-12|title=Coming Out and Leaving Home: A Policy and Research Agenda for LGBT Homeless Students|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/10.3102/0013189X17733964|journal=Educational Researcher|language=en|volume=46|issue=9|pages=498–507|doi=10.3102/0013189x17733964|issn=0013-189X}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20% to 30% of homeless youth identify as LGBT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kyu|first=Choi, Soon|last2=DM|first2=Wilson, Bianca|last3=Jama|first3=Shelton,|last4=J|first4=Gates, Gary|date=2015-06-01|title=Serving Our Youth 2015: The Needs and Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Experiencing Homelessness|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of LGBQ and 67% of transgender youth are forced out of their homes by their parents or run away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Homelessness among LGBT youth also impacts many areas of an individual's life, leading to higher rates of victimization, depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, and participation in more illegal and dangerous activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reck|first=Jen|date=2009-07-20|title=Homeless Gay and Transgender Youth of Color in San Francisco: "No One Likes Street Kids"—Even in the Castro|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19361650903013519|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|language=en|volume=6|issue=2-3|pages=223–242|doi=10.1080/19361650903013519|issn=1936-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on homelessness pathways among Latino LGBT youth found that homelessness among LGBT individuals can also be attributed to structural issues like systems of care and sociocultural and economic factors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castellanos|first=H.

Jimmie Manning performed a study in 2015 on positive and negative behavior performed during the coming out conversation. During his study, he learned that almost all of his participants would only attribute negative behaviors with themselves during the coming out conversations and positive behaviors with the recipient of the conversation. Manning suggests further research into this to figure out a way for positive behaviors to be seen and performed equally by both the recipient and the individual coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manning|first1=Jimmie|title=Positive and Negative Communicative Behaviors in Coming-out Conversations|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2015|volume=62|issue=1|pages=61–97|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2014.957127#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzAwOTE4MzY5LjIwMTQuOTU3MTI3QEBAMA==|doi=10.1080/00918369.2014.957127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In/out metaphors ==

=== Dichotomy ===
The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out" wherein those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst [[Judith Butler]] (1991) states that the ''in/out'' metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false and that being out in the "light of illumination" reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that "it is possible to argue that...there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or [[category mistake]]s...to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency".

=== Criticisms ===
In addition Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time". Further, "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".

Furthermore, Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appears to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life.  However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

This day was the inspiration for holding [[LGBT History Month]] in the United States in October. The day was founded in 1988, by Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and [[Jean O'Leary]] to celebrate the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on [[Washington, DC]], United States, for gay and lesbian equality. In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of [[LGBT parenting|LGBT families]] living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named "''National'' Coming Out Day", it is observed in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland also on October 11, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on October 11, 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: ''[[Being Out Rocks]]''. Participating artists include [[Kevin Aviance]], [[Janis Ian]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

=== Depictions of coming out ===
{{see also|:Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films}}

In 1996, the acclaimed British film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' had a positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity. In 1987, a two-part episode of the [[Quebec]] television series ''[[Avec un grand A]]'', “Lise, Pierre et Marcel”, depicted a married closeted man who has to come out when his wife discovers that he has been having an affair with another man. In the [[Emmy Award]]-nominated episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]" of ''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'', Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.

[[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s coming out in the media as well as an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', "[[The Puppy Episode]]", "ranks, hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history", changing media portrayals of [[lesbian]]s in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Streitmatter, Rodger (2009). From 'Perverts' to 'Fab Five': The Media's Changing Depiction of Gay Men and Lesbians, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7890-3670-3}}; p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Russell T Davies]]'s [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|''Queer as Folk'']], a popular TV series shown on Channel 4 (UK) debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the processes of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the U.S. version of ''Queer As Folk'', which debuted in 2000.

The television show ''[[The L Word]]'', which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women, and the theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.

''[[Coming Out Serie|Coming Out]]'', which debuted in 2013, is the first [[Quebec]] television program about being gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|title=Coming out – Première série web sur l’univers gai québécois|work=Info-Culture.biz|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014184911/http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 of the Norwegian Teen drama series [[Skam (TV series)|SKAM]] focused on a main character coming out and his relationship with another boy.

''[[Love, Simon]]'', based on the book, [[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]], debuted in 2018, and is the first major studio film about a gay teenager coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|title=Love, Simon Is a Charming Gay Studio Movie That Makes Us Hungry for More|last=Lawson|first=Richard|work=HWD|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221724/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|archivedate=2018-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended use in LGBT media, publishing and activism ==
"Out" is a common word or prefix used in the titles of LGBT-themed books, films, periodicals, organizations, and TV programs. Some high-profile examples are [[Out (magazine)|Out Magazine]], the defunct [[OutWeek|OutWeek Magazine]], and [[OutTV (Canada)|OutTV]].

== Non-LGBT applications ==
In political, casual, or even humorous contexts, "coming out" means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, identities, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring [[shame]]. Some examples include: "coming out as an alcoholic",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |title=The show must go on |publisher=Guardian |date=2001-11-03 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |location=London |first=Louis |last=Theroux |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224171957/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM#Coming out|coming out as a BDSM participant]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|title=Coming out BDSM: upsides and downsides|work=Clarisse Thorn|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141010032330/http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out of the broom closet" (as a [[witchcraft|witch]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=How do I tell my family I'm a Wiccan? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64qzmH4oD?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence/2003/12/witch_way.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "coming out as a conservative",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm Coming-out day for conservatives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206100727/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as disabled",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|title=Coming out as disabled - Ekklesia|work=ekklesia.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627142409/http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|archivedate=2015-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a liberal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |title=Layout 1 (Page A1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102092533/http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[intersex]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|title=The LA radio host who came out as intersex and why no one gossiped|work=Gay Star News|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013081549/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2multiples.com/compd/ |title=COMPD&amp;nbsp;– Introduction |publisher=2multiples.com |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[polyamory|polyamorous]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|title=Polyamorists Come Out of the Closet - National Review Online|work=National Review Online|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085106/http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a [[sex work]]er",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|title=What It's Like to Come Out of the Hooker Closet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014095839/http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|archivedate=2014-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "coming out of the shadows" as an [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|undocumented immigrant]] within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrunker|first=Laura|date=2012-01-01|title="Coming Out of the Shadows": DREAM Act Activism in the Context of Global Anti-Deportation Activism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=143–168|issn=1543-0367|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919195021/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|archivedate=2016-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used by members of online [[BIID]] communities to refer to the process of telling friends and families about their condition.

'''''Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information''''' is a popular [[science book]] by [[Vlatko Vedral]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010. Vedral examines [[information theory]] and proposes [[information]] as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and [[physical phenomena]]. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of [[entropy]], the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]], the replication of DNA, development of [[social networks]], [[quantum]] behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of [[indeterminism]] in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of [[particles]], time, [[determinism]], and of reality itself.

==Contents==

==="Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing"===
Vedral believes in the principle that information is physical. ''[[Creation ex nihilo]]'' comes from [[Catholic]] dogma, the idea being that God created the universe out of nothing. Vedral says that invoking a supernatural being as an explanation for creation does not explain reality because the supernatural being would have to come into existence itself too somehow presumably from nothing (or else from an infinite regression of supernatural beings), thus of course the reality can come from nothing without a supernatural being. [[Occam's razor]] principle favours the simplest explanation. Vedral believes information is the fundamental building block of reality as it occurs at the macro level (economics, human behaviour etc.) as well as the subatomic level. Vedral argues that information is the only candidate for such a building block that can explain its own existence as information generates additional information that needs to be compressed thus generating more information. 'Annihilation of everything' is a more fitting term than ''creation ex nihilo'' Vedral states, as compression of possibilities is the process of how new information is created.

==="Information for all Seasons"===
Vedral uses an [[Italo Calvino]] philosophical story about a [[tarot]]-like card game as the kernel for his metaphor of conscious life arriving ''[[in medias res]]'' to a pre-existing contextual reality. In this game the individual observers/players (Vedral suggests: quantum physics, thermodynamics, biology, sociology, economics, philosophy) lay down cards with ambiguous meanings as an attempt to communicate messages to deduce meaning out of the other players' interactions. The results (information) of previous rounds establish contextual rules for observers/players in subsequent rounds. The point of this game is not established until the last card has been played as later cards can change the meaning of previous events, as in the case of the quantum explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]] instantly disproving [[classical physics]]. Vedral points out that in our reality there is no last card.

==="Back to Basics: Bits and Pieces"===
[[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] or information content measured as the surprise value of a particular event, is essentially inversely proportional to the logarithm of the event's probability, i = log(1/p). [[Claude Shannon]]'s information theory arose from research at [[Bell labs]], building upon [[George Boole|George Boole's]] digital logic. As information theory predicts common and easily predicted words tend to become shorter for optimal communication channel efficiency while less common words tend to be longer for redundancy and [[error correction]]. Vedral compares the process of life to [[John von Neumann]]'s self replicating [[automata]]. These are enduring information carriers that will survive wear and tear of the individual by producing copies that can in turn go on to produce more copies.

==="Digital Romance: Life is a Four-Letter Word"===
Genetic code as an efficient digital information store, containing built in [[codon]] redundancy for error correction in transcription.

==="Murphy’s Law: I Knew this Would Happen to Me"===
Examines the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics and the process of information increasing entropy. [[Maxwell's Demon]] was thought to be a way around this inevitability, however such a demon would run out of information storage space and have to delete unwanted data thus having to do work to do so, increasing entropy.

==="Place Your Bets: In It to Win It"===
[[Blackjack]] as controlled risk taking using Shannon's information theory probability formulas. Casino as a ′cool′ financial entropy source and the gambler as a ′hot′ financial source, once again the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics means the flow is almost always from hot to cold in the long run. For managed risk spread bets widely and in high risk high reward investments (assuming a known probability), this is the Log optimal portfolio approach.

==="Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin’"===
[[Six degrees of separation]] means well connected people tend to be more successful as their social networks expose them to more chances to make choices they want. [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] precommitment as strategy in social and self-control, for example burning your bridges by buying gym membership to help motivated self win over lazy self. [[Mutual information]] resulting in [[phase transitions]] in social and political demography as well as physical systems, like water freezing into ice at a particular critical temperature or magnetic fields spontaneously aligning in certain atoms when cooling from a molten state.

==="Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!"===
Vedral examines the basis of [[quantum information]], the [[qubit]], and examines [[one-time pad]] quantum cryptography as the most secure form of [[encryption]] because of its uncomputability. [[Quantum entanglement]] demonstrates the importance of mutual information in defining outcomes in a reality.

==="Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers"===
[[Quantum computers]] offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum [[Quantum superposition|superpositions]]. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical [[algorithms]]. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.

==="Children of the Aimless Chance: Randomness versus Determinism"===
[[Randomness]] is key to generating new sources of surprise in a reality. Compression of these new sources to discard unimportant information is the [[deterministic]] element and organising principle.

==="Sand Reckoning: Whose Information is It, Anyway?"===
The information content of the universe as measured in [[bit]]s or [[qubits]]. Vedral uses the initial effort of [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse in calculating the [[The Sand Reckoner|amount of sand]] that could theoretically fit inside the universe and compares it to a modern-day attempt to calculate the bit content of the universe. Vedral however sees this content as ultimately limitless as possibly maximum entropy is never reached as compression of complexity is an open ended process and random events will continue to occur. As Vedral sees information as the ultimate building block of physical reality, he speculates that information originating at any scale can force outcomes in all other scales to abide where mutual information is shared. For example, a human performed macro-level scientific test in search of a behaviour in a quantum particle could set parameters for that type of particle in the future when subjected to a similar test.

==="Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something"===
The information basis for ''creation ex nihilo''. According to [[John von Neumann]], starting trivially from an [[empty set]] of numbers an [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of numbers can [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] their way out. An empty set creates the number 1 by observing an empty set within itself which is enough of a basis for distinguishability. It creates the number 2 by observing an empty set within the second empty set and the number 1, and so on. Vedral sees this not as creation but as [[data compression]], as every event of a reality breaks the [[symmetry]] of the pre-existing formlessness. Science is the process of describing a large amount of observed phenomena in a compressed programmatic way to predict future outcomes, and in this process of data compression science creates new information by eliminating all contrary possibilities to explain those phenomena.

==Synopsis==
The book explains the world as being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter [[Digital data|digital]] code called [[DNA]]. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]]. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as '[[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]', which [[Einstein]] called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast [[quantum computers]], and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and his concept of “[[it from bit]]”. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.

==History==
DeviantArt started as a site connected with people who took computer applications and modified them to their own tastes, or who "deviated" the applications from the original designs. As the site grew, members in general became known as "deviants" and submissions as "deviations".&lt;ref&gt;Perkel, Daniel. [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dperkel/diss/DanPerkel-dissertation-2011_update.pdf "Making Art, Creating Infrastructure: DeviantArt and the Production of the Web"]. Berkeley CA. Retrieved September 28, 2012. p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.deviantart.com/15/|title=DeviantArt FAQ - What is a deviation?|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeviantArt was originally launched on August 7, 2000, by Scott Jarkoff, Matt Stephens, [[Angelo Sotira]] and others, as part of a larger network of music-related websites called the Dmusic Network. The site flourished largely because of its unique offering and the contributions of its core member base and a team of volunteers after its launch,&lt;ref name="spyed_journal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/609173/ |title=spyed's DeviantArt Journal |author=Angelo Sotira |date=April 10, 2003 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was officially incorporated in 2001 about eight months after launch.&lt;ref name="tc_angelo_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/22/stop-being-weak-an-interview-with-angelo-sotira-ceo-of-deviantart-com-tctv/|title=TechCrunch|author=[[Cyan Banister]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeviantArt was loosely inspired by projects like [[Winamp]] facelift, customize.org, deskmod.com, screenphuck.com, and skinz.org, all application skin-based websites. Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an "art community". Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project, from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration. Angelo Sotira currently serves as the [[chief executive officer]] of DeviantArt, Inc.&lt;ref name="tc_angelo_interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.deviantart.com/ |title=deviantArt: About DeviantArt's Team Core |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/125134/ |title=News: TMD: 10 X 10 |publisher=News.deviantart.com |accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2006, DeviantArt gave its users the option to submit their works under [[Creative Commons licenses]] giving the artists the right to choose how their works can be used.&lt;ref name="newsubmission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/23753/ |title=News: New Submission Process... LIVE! |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Creative Commons license is one of several public copyright licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works. On September 30, 2007, a film category was added to DeviantArt, allowing artists to upload videos. An artist and other viewers can add annotations to sections of the film, giving comments or critiques to the artist about a particular moment in the film.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/34930/ |title=News: Now Playing: DeviantArt Film! |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, DeviantArt received $3.5 million in [[Series A round|Series A]] (first round) funding from undisclosed investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Online Art Community DeviantArt Secures $3.5 Million In First Round|date = June 22, 2007|url = http://paidcontent.org/2007/06/22/419-draft-online-art-community-secures-35-in-first-round/|first = David|last = Kaplan|publisher = Paidcontent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, it received $10 million in [[Series B]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crunchbase.com/company/deviantart|title = DeviantArt Recent Milestones|publisher = Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2014, the site unveiled a new logo and announced the release of an official [[mobile app]] on both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3039224/deviantart-app|title=With Its New App, DeviantArt Finally Has A Mobile Place For Those 65 Million Monthly Visitors|work=Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be released on December 10, 2014.&lt;ref name="da-boldlyfacing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boldly Facing The Future|url=http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/Boldly-Facing-The-Future-498282387|website=spyed's journal|publisher=deviantArt|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2017, DeviantArt was acquired by [[Wix.com|Wix.com, Inc.]] for $36 million. The site plans to integrate DeviantArt and Wix functionality, including the ability to utilize DA resources on websites built with Wix, and integrating some of Wix's design tools into the site.&lt;ref name="tc-wixda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Website builder Wix acquires art community DeviantArt for $36M|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/website-builder-wix-acquires-art-community-deviantart-for-36m/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 1, 2017, DeviantArt banned [[Syria]] from accessing its services entirely citing US and Israeli sanctions and aftermath, on February 19, 2018, Syrian user "Mythiril" used a VPN to access the site and disclose the geoblocking in a journal "the Hypocrisy of Deviantart" that sparked a public outcry across Deviantart and other sites.  DeviantArt eventually ended the geoblocking except for commercial features.&lt;ref name="da-hypo"&gt;{{cite web|title=The hypocrisy of DeviantArt|url=https://mythiril.deviantart.com/journal/The-hypocrisy-of-deviantArt-731065159|website=DeviantARt|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright and licensing issues ===
There is no review for potential copyright and [[Creative Commons]] licensing violations when a work is submitted to DeviantArt, so potential violations can remain unnoticed until reported to administrators using the mechanism available for such issues.&lt;ref name="help_copyvio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://help.deviantArt.com/155/ | title=FAQ #155: How do I report a submission which I think breaks the rules? on DeviantArt Help and FAQ | accessdate=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the community have been the victims of copyright infringement from vendors using artwork illegally on products and prints, as reported in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2007/05/29/art-theft-scandals-rock-deviantart/ | title=Art Theft Scandals Rock deviantArt | date=May 29, 2016 |publisher=PlagiarismToday |access-date=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Sarah |date=May 5, 2014 |title=DeviantART clarifies it doesn't sell artists' work after Hot Topic shirt debacle |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/deviantart-hot-topic-shirt-art-stolen/ |publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]'' |access-date=November 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporting system in which to counteract copyright infringement directly on the site has been subject to a multitude of criticism from members of the site, given that it may take weeks, or even a month before a filed complaint for copyright infringement is answered.

=== Contests for companies and academia ===
Due to the nature of DeviantArt as an art community with worldwide reach, companies use DeviantArt to promote themselves and create more advertising through contests.  ''CoolClimate'' is a research network connected with the University of California, and they held a contest in 2012 to address the impact of climate change. Worldwide submissions were received, and the winner was featured in ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christos-lamprianidis/coolclimate-art-contest-w_b_754929.html |title=Christos Lamprianidis: CoolClimate Art Contest Winner: What Motivated Me |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various car companies have held contests. [[Dodge]] ran a contest in 2012 for art of the [[Dodge Dart]] and over 4,000 submissions were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmnews.com/dodge-dart-looks-to-score-during-nfl-opener/article/257672/ |title=Dodge Dart looks to score during NFL opener – Direct Marketing News |publisher=Dmnews.com |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners received cash and item prizes, and were featured in a gallery at Dodge-Chrysler headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deviantart.com/journal/Dodge-Dart-Inspired-By-You-Contest-296645585 |title=Dodge Dart Inspired By You Contest by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=DeviantArt.com |date=April 17, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lexus]] partnered with DeviantArt in 2013 to run a contest for cash and other prizes based on their [[Lexus IS]] design; the winner's design became a modified Lexus IS and was showcased at the [[SEMA]] 2013 show in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Lexus-IS-Design-Contest-382663603 |title=Lexus IS Design Contest by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=July 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeviantArt also hosts contests for upcoming movies, such as ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]''. Fan art for ''Riddick'' was submitted, and director [[David Twohy]] chose the winners, who would receive cash prizes and some other DeviantArt-related prizes, as well as having their artwork made into official fan-art posters for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Riddick-Rule-the-Dark-Winners-395129005 |title=Riddick 'Rule the Dark' Winners by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/The-Riddick-Rule-the-Dark-Fan-Art-Contest-385949865 |title=The Riddick 'Rule the Dark Fan Art Contest' by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar contest was held for [[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]] where winners received cash and other prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/Dark-Shadows-The-Barnabas-Portrait-Project-295136507 |title=Dark Shadows: The Barnabas Portrait Project by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/The-Barnabas-Portrait-Project-Winners-Announcement-301322222 |title=The Barnabas Portrait Project Winners Announcement by Moonbeam13 on deviantART |publisher=Moonbeam13.deviantart.com |date=May 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games also conduct contests with DeviantArt, such as the 2013 ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' contest. The winner had their art made into an official print sold internationally at the Tomb Raider store, and received cash and other prizes. Other winners also received cash and DeviantArt-related prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayame-kenoshi.deviantart.com/journal/Tomb-Raider-Reborn-Contest-351846219 |title=Tomb Raider Reborn Contest by Ayame-Kenoshi on deviantART |publisher=Ayame-kenoshi.deviantart.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 14, 2018, Administrator of DeviantArt, [https://www.deviantart.com/danlev danlev] released of journal for all beta tester to test the new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deviantart.com/danlev/journal/BETA-TEST-DeviantArt-Eclipse-772595054|title=BETA TEST: DeviantArt Eclipse|website=DeviantArt|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there over 4,000 user tried Eclipse, 1,700 feedback, 407 bug reports, 532 feature request and 748 pieces of general commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deviantart.com/heidi/journal/Thank-You-for-Your-Feedback-on-Eclipse-773552372|title=Thank You for Your Feedback on Eclipse!|website=DeviantArt|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still currently available for beta tester. &lt;!-- There is no date confirmed whenever this update will be released for all member. --&gt;

It received mostly mixed responses as user biggest complain is removal of Custom Box, an Widget that only allow user who have Core (DeviantArt Membership) to customize, using CSS and [[HTML]] which the reason for user to buy Core Membership.


DeviantArt are currently working on new customization and personalization options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deviantart.com/danlev/journal/Eclipse-Change-Log-November-28-2018-774539669|title=Eclipse Change Log: November 28, 2018|website=DeviantArt|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Feature before other social media ==
Along with the version upgrades, there have been numerous features that DeviantArt was using before other social websites. Co-founder Angelo Sotira shared these in an interview:&lt;ref name="Wang, Jennifer 2011 p.27"/&gt;

===deviantART Summit===
On June 17 and 18, 2005, DeviantArt held their first convention, the deviantART Summit, at the [[Hollywood Palladium|Palladium]] in the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] area of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The [[wiktionary:summit#Noun|summit]] consisted of several exhibitions by numerous artists, including [[computer art scene|artscene groups]] old and new at about 200 different booths. Giant projection screens displayed artwork as it was being submitted live to DeviantArt, which was receiving 50,000 new images daily at the time.&lt;!-- Invalid &lt;ref name="times_linerider" /&gt; The summit also hosted various art-related workshops and seminars.&lt;ref name="summit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/16992/ |title=News: The 2005 deviantART Summit |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===deviantART World Tour===
Starting May 13, 2009, DeviantArt embarked on a world tour, visiting cities around the world, including [[Sydney]], [[Singapore]], [[Warsaw]], [[Istanbul]], [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles]]. During the world tour, the new "Portfolio" feature of DeviantArt was previewed to attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/79645/ | title=deviantART World Tour 2009|author=DeviantArt|date=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hq.deviantart.com/ | title=#hq on deviantArt|author=DeviantArt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Birthday Bashes" and deviantMEET===
Occasionally, DeviantArt hosts a meeting for members to come together in real life and interact, exchange, and have fun. There have been meetings for the birthday of DeviantArt, called "Birthday Bashes", as well as simple general get-togethers around the world. In 2010, European DeviantArt members held a deviantMEET to celebrate DeviantArt's birthday in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deviantart.com/darelated/devmeet/?order=9&amp;q=birthday+bash |title=Browsing DeviantMEETS on deviantART |publisher=DeviantArt.com |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a celebration that year in the House of Blues in Hollywood, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heidi.deviantart.com/journal/deviantART-s-10th-BirthdAy-Bash-Party-with-us-214229857# |title=deviantART's 10th BirthdAy Bash!

The '''extended evolutionary synthesis''' consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]] that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by [[C. H. Waddington]], argued for on the basis of [[punctuated equilibrium]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and [[Gerd B. Müller]].

The extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Uller|first2=Tobias|last3=Feldman|first3=Marcus W.|last4=Sterelny|first4=Kim|last5=Müller|first5=Gerd B.|last6=Moczek|first6=Armin|last7=Jablonka|first7=Eva|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=John|date=2015-08-22|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151019|journal=Proc.

Not all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in [[evolutionary developmental biology]], which concetrates on developmental [[molecular genetics]] and [[evolution]] to understand how [[natural selection]] operated on developmental processes and [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]].

==The preceding "modern synthesis"==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]]. However, it did not unify all of biology, omitting sciences such as [[developmental biology]].]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[Mendelian genetics|genetics]] in a joint mathematical framework. It established [[evolution]] as [[biology]]'s central [[paradigm#Scientific paradigm|paradigm]]. The 19th-century ideas of [[natural selection]] by Darwin and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were united by researchers who included [[Ronald Fisher]], one of the three founders of [[population genetics]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], between 1918 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Sciences |authorlink=National Academy of Sciences |year=1999 |title=Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024 |edition= 2nd |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academy Press |isbn=0-309-06406-6 |lccn=99006259 |oclc=43803228 |page=28 |quote=The scientific consensus around evolution is overwhelming.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis.

==Early history==

During the 1950s, the English biologist [[C. H. Waddington]] called for an extended synthesis based on his research on [[epigenetics]] and [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilkins | first1=Adam S | year=2008 | title=Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now | url=| journal=Biological Theory | volume=3 | issue=3| pages=224–232 | doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.3.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pigliucci | first1=Massimo | authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2006 | title=Phenotypic plasticity and evolution by genetic assimilation | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/12/2362.full | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 | issue=| pages=2362–2367 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?'' BioEssays 34: 149-157.&lt;/ref&gt; An extended synthesis was also proposed by the Austrian zoologist [[Rupert Riedl]], with the study of [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Günter P; Laubichler; Manfred D. (2004). [http://www.yale.edu/gpwagner/pdfs/Riedl2004.pdf "Rupert Riedl and the Re-Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Biology: Body Plans and Evolvability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094623/http://www.yale.edu/gpwagner/pdfs/Riedl2004.pdf |date=2015-12-08 }}. ''[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]]'' (Mol Dev Evol) 302B: 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Michael J. D. White]] wrote about an extension of the modern synthesis based on new research from [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Parnell, Dennis R. (1978). ''Heralding a New Synthesis Modes of Speciation by M. J. D. White''. Systematic Botany. Vol. 3, No. 1. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s: punctuated equilibrium==

In the 1980s, the American palaeontologists [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]], the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and [[natural selection]] working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay. (1980). ''Is a New and General Theory of Evolution Emerging?'' Paleobiology. Vol. 6, No. 1. pp. 119-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gould | first1=Stephen Jay | year=1982 | title=Darwinism and the Expansion of Evolutionary Theory | url=| journal=Science | volume=216 | issue=4544| pages=380–387 | doi=10.1126/science.7041256| bibcode=1982Sci...216..380G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/a-more-modern-synthesis "A More Modern Synthesis"].

The ethologist [[John Endler]] wrote a paper in 1988 discussing processes of evolution that he felt had been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Endler, John A; McLellan, Tracy. (1988).

==Contributions from evolutionary developmental biology==
{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

Some researchers in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] proposed another synthesis. They argue that the modern and extended syntheses should mostly center on [[gene]]s and suggest an integration of [[embryology]] with [[molecular genetics]] an [[evolution]], aiming to understand how [[natural selection]] operates on [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] and [[Deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[Conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]], [[transcription factor]]s and [[signalling pathways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61756485|title=The regulatory genome : gene regulatory networks in development and evolution|last=1937-2015,|first=Davidson, Eric H.,|isbn=0120885638|location=Amsterdam [Netherlands]|oclc=61756485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laubichler 2015" /&gt; By contrast, a different strand of evo-devo following an organismal approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bateson | first1=P | year=2005 | title=The Return of the Whole Organism | url=| journal=Journal of Biosciences | volume=30 | issue=| pages=31–39 | doi=10.1007/bf02705148 | pmid=15824439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huneman | first1=Philippe | year=2010 | title=Assessing the Prospects for a Return of Organisms in Evolutionary Biology | url=| journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences | volume=32 | pages=341–372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Opitz | first2=G. | last3=Raff | first3=R. | year=1996 | title=Resynthesizing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | url=| journal=Development and Evolution | volume=173 | issue=| pages=357–372 | doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0032 | pmid=8605997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=G.

===Predictions===
The extended synthesis is characterized by its additional set of predictions that differ from the standard modern synthesis theory:

# changes in phenotype are predominantly positive, rather than neutral (see: [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]])

===Testing===

The extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1=|title=Should Evolutionary Theory Evolve|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/04/evolution-templeton-grant.page|website=University of Southampton|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laland|first1=Kevin|title=Launching the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis project|url=https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24915-kevin-laland/posts/14200-launching-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis-project|website=Nature Research Ecology &amp; Evolution Community|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is headed by [[Kevin Laland|Kevin N. Laland]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and Tobias Uller at [[Lund University]]. According to Laland what the extended synthesis "really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/empowering-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/ "Empowering the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis"]. The Evolution Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Biologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lindsay R.|date=2010-06|title=The So-Called Extended Synthesis and Population Genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/BIOT_a_00035|journal=Biological Theory|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.1162/biot_a_00035|issn=1555-5542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laland, Kevin, Tobias Uller, Marc Feldman, Kim Sterelny, Gerd B.

For example, [[Denis Noble]] says that using terms and categories of the modern synthesis distort the picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noble|first1=Denis |authorlink=Denis Noble |title=Evolution Beyond Neo-Darwinism: A New Conceptual Framework|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=1 January 2015|volume=218|issue=Pt 1|pages=7–13|doi=10.1242/jeb.106310|pmid=25568446 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/1/7.long|pmc=4436573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents therefore claim that the extended synthesis is necessary to help expand the conceptions and framework of how evolution is considered throughout the biological disciplines.&lt;ref name="Smee 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Gerd B.|date=2017-10-06|title=Why an extended evolutionary synthesis is necessary|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/5/20170015|journal=Interface Focus|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=20170015|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2017.0015|issn=2042-8898|pmc=5566817|pmid=28839929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heteronomy''' refers to action that is influenced by a force outside the individual, in other words the state or condition of being ruled, governed, or under the sway of another, as in a military occupation. 

[[Immanuel Kant]], drawing on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]],&lt;ref&gt; Rousseau, J.J. ([2010] 1754-1762). ''The Social Contract, A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, and A Discourse on Political Economy.'' New York: Classic Books International.&lt;/ref&gt; considered such an action nonmoral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1/KSPglos.html Glossary of Kant's Technical Terms] by Stephen Palmquist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912403176|title=Agency and autonomy in Kant's moral theory|last=Andrews.|first=Reath,|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0199288828|location=|pages=36|oclc=912403176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the counter/opposite of [[autonomy]].

Philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] contrasted heteronomy with autonomy by noting that while all societies create their own institutions (laws, traditions and behaviors), autonomous societies are those in which their members are aware of this fact, and explicitly self-institute (αυτο-νομούνται). In contrast, the members of heteronomous societies (hetero = others) attribute their  [[imaginary (Sociology)|imaginaries]] to some extra-social authority (e.g., God, the state, ancestors, historical necessity, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castoriadis|first=Cornelius|date=1986-10-01|title=the nature and value of equality translated by david a. curtis|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019145378601100404|journal=Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=373–390|doi=10.1177/019145378601100404|issn=0191-4537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infinity Walk''' is a therapeutic method for progressively developing coordination. It is typically usedin those with brain injuries or learning disabilities.

A beginning student or patient learns to walk smoothly in a figure-eight pattern while looking at an object or person across the room.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_HGDNdq8E0 This video] shows a simple infinity walk.&lt;/ref&gt; As they become able to do that consistently, other physical and mental activities are added to the coordinated walking. An advanced walker can maintain a smooth figure-eight walk while doing several other activities, ''e.g.,'' simultaneously gesturing and doing mental arithmetic as they converse with their teacher or therapist.

Developed in the 1980s by clinical psychologist Deborah Sunbeck. It strives to improve the sensorimotor functioning of those who practice it.&lt;ref name='Sunbeck1996'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sunbeck | first1 = Deborah | title = Infinity Walk: Preparing your mind to learn! | publisher = Jalmar Press | year = 1996 | location = Torrance, California | isbn = 1-880396-31-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the method, Sunbeck also applied knowledge of [[social facilitation]] and [[intrinsic motivation]] to the task of creating a self-motivating method of physical and mental skill-building that would help the user develop resilient [[self-regulated learning]] strategies for future challenges.&lt;ref name='Sunbeck2002'&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Sunbeck | first1 = Deborah | title = The Complete Infinity Walk, Book 1: The Physical Self | publisher = The Leonardo Foundation Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-9705164-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18262">The '''Information Coding Classification''' ('''ICC''') is a [[classification system]] covering almost all extant 6500 knowledge fields ([[knowledge domain]]s). Its [[conceptualization]] goes beyond the scope of the well known  library classification systems, such as [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DCC), [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), and [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC), by extending also to [[knowledge system]]s that so far have not afforded to  classify  [[literature]].  ICC actually presents a flexible universal ordering system for both literature and other kinds of [[information]], set out as knowledge fields. From a methodological point of view, ICC differs from the above-mentioned systems along the following three lines:
# Its main classes are not based on [[discipline]]s but on nine live stages of development, so-called [[ontic]]al levels.
# It breaks them roughly down into hierarchical steps by further nine [[Categorization|categories]] which makes decimal number coding possible.
# The contents of a knowledge field is earmarked via a digital position scheme, which makes the first hierarchical step refer to the nine ontical levels  (object areas as subject categories), and the second hierarchical step refer to nine functionally ordered form categories.
Respective knowledge fields permit to step down by the same principle to a third and  forth level, and even further to a fifth and sixth level. Finally, knowledge field subdivisions will have to conform to said digital position scheme.
Hence, for a given knowledge field identical codes will mark identical categories under respective numbers of the coding system. This  [[mnemotechnics|mnemotechnical]]  aspect of the  system helps memorizing and straightaway retrieving the whereabouts of respective [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] fields.

The first two hierarchical levels may be regarded as a top- or [[upper ontology]] for ontologies and other applications.

The terms of the first three hierarchical levels were set out in German and English in ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft'',&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Ingetraut Dahlberg]]|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Sektion der Internationalen Gesellschaft für Wissensorganisation e.V.

It was published in 2014 and available so far only in German. In the meantime, also the French terms of the knowlwdge fields have been collected.
Competence for maintenance and further development rests with the German Chapter of the  
[[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO) e.V.

== Historical development ==
At the end of 1970, Prof. Alwin Diemer, Univ.of Düsseldorf proposed to [[Ingetraut Dahlberg]] to undertake a philosophical [[dissertation]] on ''The universal classification system of knowledge, its ontological, epistemological, and information theoretical foundations''. Diemer had in mind an innovating ontological approach for such a system based on the whole spectrum of kinds of being and complying with [[epistemological]] requirements. The third requirement had already been taken up somehow in the Indian [[Colon Classification]], yet it still called for explanations and additions. In 1974, the dissertation was published in German entitled ''Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung''.&lt;ref name="GuWo"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation e.V.|Title=Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung. Probleme und Möglichkeiten eines universalen Klassifikationssystems des Wissens. : im Antiquariat noch erhältlich sonst als Print on Demand bei deGruyter|Publisher=Verlag Dokumentation|PublicationPlace=Pullach bei München|Year=1974|ISBN=978-3111412672|Date=  1974|language=German|AccessDate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started with conceptual clarifications, and why and how the term „universal“ was linked to knowledge, including knowledge fields, such as commodity science, artefacts,  statistics, patents, standardization, communication, utility services et al. In chapter 3, six universal classification systems (DDC, UDC, LCC, BC, CC and BBK) were presented,  analyzed and compared.

While preparing the dissertation, Dahlberg started with elaborating the new universal system by first gleaning a lot of extant designations of knowledge fields from whatever available reference works. This was funded by the German Documentation Society (DGD) (1971-2) under the title of ''Order system of knowledge fields''. In addition, the [[syllabus]]es of German universities and polytechniques were explored for relevant terms and documented (1975).  Thereafter, it seemed necessary to add definitions from special dictionaries and encyclopediae; it soon appeared that the 12.500 terms included numerous synonyms, so that the whole collection boiled down to about 6.500 concept designations (Project Logstruktur, supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) 1976-78).

The outcome of this work &lt;ref name="GuWo" /&gt; was the formulation of 30 theses which ended up in 12 principles for the new system, published 40 years later under.&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; These principles refer not only to theoretical foundations but also to structure and other organizational aspects of the whole array of knowledge fields. In 1974, the digital position scheme for field subdivision had already been developed  to allow for classifying classification literature in the bibliographical section of the first issue of the Journal International Classification. In 1977, the entire ICC  was ready for presentation at a seminar in Bangalore, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science|Title=Ontical Structures and Universal Classification |PublicationPlace=Bangalore|Year=1978|Date=  1978|language=German|AccessDate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication of the first three hierarchical levels appeared however only in 1982.&lt;ref name="ICC-PSAP"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=International Classification|Title=ICC – Information Coding Classification. Principles, structure and application possibilities |Volume=2|Year=1982|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;98-103|Date=  1982|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was applied to the bibliography of classification systems and [[thesauri]] in vol.1 of the International Classification and Indexing Bibliography;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Title=International Classification and Indexing Bibliography (ICIB 1): Classification systems and thesauri 1950-1982 |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1982|ISSN=0943-7444|Date=  1982|language=German|AccessDate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been updated.&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt;

== Governing principles of ICC ==
These were published in full length in the book ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft''&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; and the  article ''Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches'',&lt;ref name="ICC2010"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Marlies Ockenfeld|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches |Volume=61, Heft 8|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2010|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;449-454|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2010|language=German|AccessDate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence it suffices to just mention their topics with some necessary additions.

* Principle 1: Concept theoretical approaches. Concepts are the contents of ICC, they are understood as being units of knowledge. The „birth“ of a concept. Where do the characteristics, the knowledge elements come from? How do conceptual relations arise?
* Principle 2: The four kinds of concept relations and their applications.
* Principle 3: Decimal numbers form the ICC codes as its universal language.
* Principle 4: The nine ontical levels of ICC. They were grouped under three captions: Prolegomena (1-3), life sciences (4-6) and human output (7-9):
:# Structure and form
:# Matter and energy
:# Cosmos and earth
:# Biosphere
:# Anthroposphere
:# Sociosphere
:# Material products (economics and technology)
:# Intellectual products (knowledge and information)
:# Spiritual products (products of mind and culture)

* Principle 5: Knowledge fields are structured by categories, based on the Aristotelian form-categories, under a digital position scheme, a kind of scaling rule for subdividing a given field as follows:
:# General area: problems, theories, principles (axiom and structure)
:# Object area: objects, kinds, parts, properties of objects
:# Activity area: methods, processes, activities
:# Field properties or first characterization   
:# Persons or secondary characterization
:# Societies or tertiary characterization
:# Influences from outside
:# Applications of the field to other fields
:# Field information and synthesizing tasks
:The digital position scheme, called Systematifier, has  also been used for structuring the entire system via the categories figuring on the upper zero level.

An example of its application is the structure of the classification system for knowledge organization literature [http://www.isko.org/scheme.php Gliederung der Klassifikationsliteratur]. (A simplified version with an additional introduction is given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;71)

* Principle 6: The ontical levels outlined under principle 4 conform to the „integrative level theory“ which means that every level is integrated in the following one. In addition, each knowledge area presumes the following one.
* Principle 7: The combination potential of knowledge fields (interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity)is determined by the digital position scheme. (Examples are given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;103-4)
* Principle 8: The categories of the zero-level are general concepts, their possible subdivisions could once be used for classificatory statements. (These subdivisions still need elaboration)
* Principle 9 and 10: These relate to the combination potential of classificatory statements with space and time concepts. (Still to be elaborated)
* Principle 11: The system's mnemotechnical aspect relies on the fixed system position codes and on the 3x3 form- and subject-categories.
* Principle 12: The combination potential of system position 1, 8 and 9 make ICC to a self-networking system which complies with the present scientific development.

== ICC in Matrix Form ==

The first two levels of ICC can be represented by following matrix.

[[File:ICC as a Matrix.png|maxi|840px|ICC as a Matrix with the first two hierarchical levels]]

The first hierarchical level of the 9 subject categories results from the first vertical array under codes 1-9.  The second hierarchical level of subject categories is structured by the 9 functionally ordered form categories, listed in the first horizontal line under codes 01-09. Some exceptions are mentioned in principle 7.

== Research work with ICC ==

=== Exploration of automatic classification with ICC ===
For classifying web documents as conceived by Jens Hartmann, University of Karlsruhe, Prof.Walter Koch, University of Graz, has explored in his Institute for Applied Information Technology Research Society (AIT) the application of ICC to automatically classifying metadata of some 350.000 documents. This was facilitated by data generated within the framework of an EU-supported project [http://www.europeana-local.at "EuropeanaLocal"] . For this exploration, three ICC hierarchical levels have been used for some 5000 terms. The result is described in the report of Christoph Mak.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Christian Mak|Periodical=Bericht des Instituts "Angewandte Informationstechnik Forschungsgesellschaft mbh" (AIT)|Title=Kategorisierung des Datenbestandes der EuropeanaLocal-Österreich anhand der ICC |PublicationPlace=Graz|Year=2011|Date=  2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof.Koch regarded a classification degree of almost 50% as a good result, considering that only a shortened version of ICC had been used. In order to reach a better result one would have needed 1–2 years. Also an index of all terms with their codes could be achieved under these explorations.

=== Data Linkage with ICC ===
Motivated by the work of an Italian research Group in Trento on ''Revising the Wordnet Domains Hierarchy: semantics, coverage and balancing'',&lt;ref name="FGinTrnto"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Luisa Bentivogli|Surname2=Pamela Forner|Surname3=Bernardo Magnini|Surname4=Emanuele Pianta|Periodical=Proceedings of COLING 2004 Workshop on "Multilingual Linguistic Resources|Title=[http://multiwordnet.fbk.eu/paper/coling04-ws-WDH.pdf Revising WordNet Domains Hierarchy: Semantics, Coverage, and Balancing] |PublicationPlace=Geneva, Switzerland|Year=2004|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;101-108|Date=  2004|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which the DDC codes were used, Prof. Ernesto DeLuca et al. showed in a study that for such case the use of ICC could lead to essentially better results. This was shown in two contributions: ''Including knowledge domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (LLD)'' &lt;ref name=" IKDfICC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Knowledge Organization in the 21st Century. Between Historical Patterns and Future Prospects. Proc.13th Int. ISKO Conf.|Title=Including Knowledge Domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud |PublicationPlace=Krakau, Polen|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;258-365|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung?'',&lt;ref name="MLLDC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung? |Volume=65, Heft 4-5|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;279-287|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the LLD was used in a meta-model which contains all resources with the possibility of retrieval and navigation of data from different aspects. By this, the existing work about many thousand knowledge fields (of  ICC) can be combined with the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud, based on RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet and similar integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, MEMODATA and the Hamburg Metapher BD).

=== Semantic Web structuring with ICC ===
In October 2013, the computer scientist Hermann Bense, Dortmund, explored the possibilities for structuring the Semanic Web with ICC codes. He developed two approaches for a pictorial presentation of knowledge fields with their possible subdivisions. A graphic representation of those knowledge fields pertaining to the first two levels can be found under [http://www.ontology4.us/english/Ontologies/Science%2520Ontology/index.html Ontology4]. The inclusion of the third hierarchical level has been envisaged as the next step.

== Some potential applications of ICC in its present form ==
# Possibility to roughly structure documents, especially bibliographies and reference works.
# Structuring personal repertories, e.g. a [[Who’s Who]] in ''Who’s Who in Classification and Indexing''&lt;ref name="whoiswho"&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Title=Who's Who in Classification and Indexing |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1983|Date=  1983|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Supporting the recollection of statistics by knowledge fields, e.g. also concerning university professors, statistics of academies, of institutions, of teachers in special education
# Publishing houses could take up ICC codes for their products to help later sorting by knowledge fields.
# As a standard classification ICC may be used in many cases, especially in industry,  [[knowledge management]] and [[knowledge engineering]].
# With the definition of all its terms a lexicon of knowledge fields could be published. This could also be used for such lexica in other languages.&lt;ref name="lexikon"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=Knowledge Organisation 39, No.2|Title=A systematic new lexicon of all knowledge fields based on the Information Coding Classification. |Year=2012|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;142-150|Date=  2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# As an example, ICC could be used to compare ongoing scientific activities on a European or world-wide scale.
# ICC can also be an appropriate tool for switching between extant universal classification systems.&lt;ref name="switch"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Green, R.|Periodical=Knowledge organization &amp; change. Proc.4th Int.ISKO Conf., Washington, D.C.|Title=Library catalogs and the Internet. Switching for future subject access. |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1996|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;155-165|Date=  1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ICC can also be a suitable „hang-up system“ for special classification systems, e.g. for special terminological concept systems.
# ICC in its three hierarchies and corresponding explanations might also be used in higher education to supply the youngsters with an overview of knowledge fields and an understanding of the relationships in the whole of human knowledge.
# Similar to the [[Unified Medical Language System]] (UMLS) for medicine such a Unified System of Knowledge Fields could be held available in many languages and thus reach a global understanding of knowledge fields.
# The alphabetical index to all knowledge field concepts could be used for comparisons with other such indexes to help in finding the missing fields in the different universal classification systems.

'''''Keeping up with the Joneses''''' is an [[idiom]] in many parts of the [[English language|English]]-speaking world referring to the comparison to one's neighbor as a benchmark for [[social class]] or the accumulation of material goods. To fail to "keep up with the Joneses" is perceived as demonstrating socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase originated in a [[Keeping Up with the Joneses (comics)|comic strip of the same name]].&lt;ref name=Safire&gt;Safire, William (November 15, 1998). [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/15/magazine/on-language-up-the-down-ladder.html?src=pm "On Language; Up the Down Ladder"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;{{cite web |last= Markstein|first=Don|year=2010|website=www.toonpedia.com|publisher=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |title= Keeping Up with the Joneses |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/joneses.htm|access-date=June 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Keeping up with the joneses.png|thumb|right|510px|Comic strip by Pop Momand, 1921.]]

The phrase originates with the [[comic strip]] ''[[Keeping Up with the Joneses (comics)|Keeping Up with the Joneses]]'', created by [[Arthur R. "Pop" Momand]] in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in ''[[The New York World]]'' and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the [[social climber|social climbing]] McGinis family, who struggle to "keep up" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were [[unseen character]]s throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom ''keeping up with the Joneses'' has remained popular long after the strip's end.&lt;ref name="Safire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toonopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2011/02/pop-momand-profiled-by-alex-jay.html|title=Stripper's Guide|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hendrickson, ''The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://manof300.com/why-are-we-keeping-up-with-the-joneses/|title= Why are We Keeping Up with the Joneses? |publisher= Man of 300|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the name ''Jones'' for neighbors involved in social comparison predates Momand's comic strip. In 1879, English writer E. J. Simmons wrote in ''Memoirs of a Station Master'' of the railroad station as a place for social exchange: "The Joneses, who don't associate with the Robinsons, meet there."&lt;ref name=Safire/&gt; American humorist [[Mark Twain]] made an allusion to Smith and Jones families with regard to social custom in the essay "Corn Pone Opinions," written in 1901 but first published in 1923. "The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith verdict."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain, [http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/cornponetwain.htm "Corn Pone Opinions"]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1908, D.W. Griffith directed a series of comedy shorts starring The [[Biograph Girl]], [[Florence Lawrence]], featuring the people next door, The Joneses.

An alternative explanation is that the Joneses of the saying refer to the wealthy family of [[Edith Wharton]]'s father, the Joneses.&lt;ref name=Lee2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee, Hermione |title=Edith Wharton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEgqbyOkK28C&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-84595-201-3 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joneses were a prominent New York family with substantial interests in [[Chemical Bank]] as a result of marrying the daughters of the bank's founder, [[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Troubiand Post|first=Marie Caroline|title=The descendants of John Jones and John Mason|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joneses and other rich New Yorkers began to build country villas in the [[Hudson Valley]] around [[Rhinecliff, New York|Rhinecliff]] and [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck]], which had belonged to the [[Livingston family|Livingstons]], another prominent New York family to whom the Joneses were related. The houses became grander and grander. In 1853, Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones built a 24-room [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] villa called [[Wyndcliffe]] described by [[Henry Winthrop Sargent]] in 1859 as being very fine in the style of a Scottish castle, but by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth's niece, as a gloomy monstrosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wharton|first=Edith|title=A Backward Glance|year=1934|publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villa reportedly spurred more building, including a house by William B. Astor (married to a Jones cousin), a phenomenon described as "keeping up with the Joneses". The phrase is also associated with another of Edith Wharton's aunts, Mary Mason Jones, who built a large mansion at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 57th Street, then undeveloped. Wharton portrays her affectionately in ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' as Mrs. Manson Mingott, "calmly waiting for fashion to flow north".

A slightly different version is that the phrase refers to the grand lifestyle of the Joneses who by the mid-century were numerous and wealthy, thanks to the Chemical Bank and Mason connection. It was their relation [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor|Mrs William Backhouse Astor, Jr]] who began the "patriarchs balls", the origin of "[[Ward McAllister#"The Four Hundred"|The Four Hundred]]", the list of the society elite who were invited. By then the Joneses were being eclipsed by the massive wealth of the [[Astor family|Astors]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] and others but the four hundred list published in 1892 contained many of the Joneses and their relations—old money still mattered.

==Social effects==
The philosophy of "keeping up with the Joneses" has widespread effects on some [[society|societies]].  According to this philosophy, [[conspicuous consumption]] occurs when people care about their standard of living in relation to their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Jordi Galí |last=Galí |first=Jordi |title=Keeping up with the Joneses: Consumption Externalities, Portfolio Choice, and Asset Prices |journal=[[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=1–8 |doi= |jstor=2078030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was re-introduced in 1976 when an article about parenting included it{{citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=July 2016}} and has remained a commercial and cultural watchword ever since.

According to Roger Mason, "the demand for [[Veblen goods|status goods]], fueled by ''conspicuous consumption'', has diverted many resources away from investment in the manufacture of more material goods and services in order to satisfy consumer preoccupations with their ''relative social standing'' and prestige".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Roger |title=Conspicuous Consumption and the Positional Economy: Policy and Prescription since 1970 |journal=Managerial and Decision Economics |volume=21 |issue=3/4 |year=2000 |pages=123–132 |doi=10.1002/mde.977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social status]] once depended on one's family name; however, the rise of [[consumerism]] in the United States gave rise to [[social mobility]]. With the increasing availability of goods, people became more inclined to define themselves by what they possessed and the quest for higher status accelerated. Conspicuous consumption and [[economic materialism|materialism]] have been an insatiable juggernaut ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/stuf2s99.htm "Possessions 2"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307002356/http://www.nd.edu/%7Endmag/stuf2s99.htm |date=2008-03-07 }}, ''Notre Dame magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire to increase one's position in the [[social hierarchy]] is responsible for much of the social mobility in America.  The upward mobility over the past few decades in America is due in part to the large number of women joining the labor force. U.S. women have slowly and steadily increased their participation in the labor force from 46% of all women (age 16+) in 1974 to almost 60% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582|title=Redirect Page|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in countries where the desire for upward social mobility via consumerism and conspicuous consumption is strong, the poor may not be able to better themselves. Doug Henwood observed that "both the US and British poor were more likely to stay poor for a long period of time: almost half of all people who were poor for one year stayed poor for five or more years, compared with 30% in Canada and 36% in Germany. And, despite claims of great upward mobility in the United States, 45% of the poor rose out of poverty in a given year, compared with 45% in the UK, 53% in Germany, and 56% in Canada. And of those who did exit poverty, 15% of Americans were likely to make a round trip back under the poverty line, compared with 16% in Germany, 10% in the UK, and 7% in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Henwood, Doug. After the New Economy, pp. 136-7&lt;/ref&gt; The level of income inequality in a country has an inverse relationship with social mobility according to the authors of ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better|The Spirit Level]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickett|first=Richard Wilkinson, Kate|title=The spirit level: Why more equal societies almost always do better|year=2009|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=1-84614-039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inability to "keep up with the Joneses" might result in dissatisfaction, even for people whose status is high.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100322092057.htm "Money Only Makes You Happy If It Makes You Richer Than Your Neighbors"], ''Science Daily'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in which "living above one's means" has caused negative social effects is that of credit card use. In the first quarter of 2002, total credit debt was $660 billion. By 2005, the total credit card debt had increased to $735 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jan2004/debt-j15.shtml|title=US consumer debt reaches record levels - World Socialist Web Site|author=Joanne Laurier|date=15 January 2004|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; America's average credit card debt in 2007 was $8,400 per household. By the end of 2007, consumer debt in America had risen to $2.5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creditcounselingbiz.com/credit_counseling_statistics.htm |title=Credit Counseling Statistics |website=CreditCounselingBiz.com |archive-date=2007-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224193831/http://creditcounselingbiz.com/credit_counseling_statistics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7768">The '''Kuleshov effect''' is a [[film editing]] ([[Soviet montage theory|montage]]) effect demonstrated by Soviet film-maker [[Lev Kuleshov]] in the 1910s and 1920s. It is a mental phenomenon by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation.

==Specifics==
[[File:KuleshovEffectExample.ogv|thumb|Example of a Kuleshov sequence, with the last shot changed]]
Kuleshov edited a short film in which a shot of the expressionless face of Tsarist matinee idol [[Ivan Mosjoukine]] was alternated with various other shots (a plate of soup, a girl in a coffin, a woman on a divan).  The film was shown to an audience who believed that the expression on Mosjoukine's face was different each time he appeared, depending on whether he was "looking at" the plate of soup, the girl in the coffin, or the woman on the divan, showing an expression of hunger, grief or desire, respectively. The footage of Mosjoukine was actually the same shot each time. [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] (who later claimed to have been the co-creator of the experiment) described in 1929 how the audience "raved about the acting... the heavy pensiveness of his mood over the forgotten soup, were touched and moved by the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead child, and noted the lust with which he observed the woman. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same."&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, "Naturshchik vmesto aktera", in ''Sobranie sochinenii'', Volume I, Moscow: 1974, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuleshov used the experiment to indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of film editing. The implication is that viewers brought their own emotional reactions to this sequence of images, and then moreover attributed those reactions to the actor, investing his impassive face with their own feelings. Kuleshov believed this, along with montage, had to be the basis of cinema as an independent art form.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, "The Kuleshov Effect and the Death of the Auteurism", in "Forum"&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect has also been studied by [[psychologist]]s, and is well-known among modern film-makers.  [[Alfred Hitchcock]] refers to the effect in his conversations with [[François Truffaut]], using actor [[James Stewart]] as the example.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas Leitch, Leland Poague|title= A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ePMxuoC5kTYC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Hitchcock+Kuleshov+principle+Truffaut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CIo_YBZL6L&amp;sig=ZjjJS9Z8Tqf1iSdWSoBkAakA4JY&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6hcjh8aXdAhUrAcAKHSuQDSQQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hitchcock%20Kuleshov%20principle%20Truffaut&amp;f=false|page=60|year= 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-444-397314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois, ''Hitchcock Truffaut'', New York: 1983, Chapter 11, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock, in the famous "Definition of Happiness" interview, also explains in detail many types of editing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The final form, which he calls "pure editing", is explained visually using the Kuleshov effect. In the first version of the example, Hitchcock is squinting, and the audience sees footage of a woman with a baby. The screen then returns to Hitchcock's face, now smiling. In effect, he is a kind old man. In the second example, the woman and baby are replaced with a woman in a bikini, Hitchcock explains: "What is he now? He's a dirty old man."

The experiment itself was created by assembling fragments of pre-existing film from the Tsarist film industry, with no new material.  Mosjoukine had been the leading romantic "star" of Tsarist cinema, and familiar to the audience.

Kuleshov demonstrated the necessity of considering [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] as the basic tool of cinema art.  In Kuleshov's view, the cinema consists of fragments and the assembly of those fragments, the assembly of elements which in reality are distinct. It is therefore not the content of the images in a film which is important, but their combination.  The raw materials of such an art work need not be original, but are pre-fabricated elements which can be disassembled and re-assembled by the artist into new juxtapositions.

The montage experiments carried out by Kuleshov in the late 1910s and early 1920s formed the theoretical basis of Soviet montage cinema, culminating in the famous films of the late 1920s by directors such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Dziga Vertov]], among others. These films included ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Mother (1926 film)|Mother]]'', ''[[The End of St. Petersburg]]'', and ''[[The Man with a Movie Camera]]''.

==Research==
The Kuleshov effect has only been studied by psychologists in recent years. Prince and Hensley (1992) recreated the original study design but did not find the alleged effect. The study had 137 participants but was a single-trial between-subject experiment, which is prone to noise in the data.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, S., &amp; Hensley, W.E. (1992). "The Kuleshov effect: Recreating the classic experiment". ''Cinema Journal'', 31, 59–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobbs et al. (2006) did a within-subject fMRI study and found an effect for negative, positive, or neutral valence. When a neutral face was shown behind a sad scene, it seemed sad, when it was shown behind a happy scene it seemed happy.&lt;ref&gt;Mobbs, D., Weiskopf, N., Lau, H., Featherstone, E., Dolan, R., &amp; Frith, C. (2006). "The Kuleshov Effect: The influence of contextual framing on emotional attributions". ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'', 1, 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Barratt, Rédei, Innes-Ker, and van de Weijer (2016) tested 36 participants using 24 film sequences across five emotional conditions (happiness, sadness, hunger, fear, and desire) and a neutral control condition. Again, they were able to show that neutral faces were rated in accordance with the stimuli material, confirming Mobbs et al. (2006) findings.&lt;ref&gt;Barratt, D., Rédei, A.C., Innes-Ker, A., &amp; van de Weijer, J. (2016). "Does the Kuleshov effect really exist? Revisiting a classic film experiment on facial expressions and emotional contexts". ''Perception'', 45, 847–874.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, despite the initial problems in testing the Kuleshov effect experimentally, researchers now agree that the context in which a face is shown has a significant effect on how the face is perceived.

To find out whether the Kuleshov effect can also be induced auditorily, Baranowski and Hecht intercut different clips of faces with neutral scenes, featuring either happy music, sad music, or no music at all. They found that the music significantly influenced participants’ emotional judgments of facial expression.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, A.M., &amp; Hecht, H. (2016). "The auditory Kuleshov effect: Multisensory integration in movie editing". ''Perception'', 0(0), 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two notable allegations of '''lampshades made from human skin'''. After [[World War II]] it was alleged that [[Nazi]]s had made lampshades from murdered concentration camp inmates. In the 1950s, murderer [[Ed Gein]], possibly influenced by the stories about the Nazis, made a lampshade from the skin of one of his victims.

==History of anthropodermia==
The display of the flayed skin of defeated enemies has a long history. In ancient [[Assyria]], the flaying of defeated enemies and dissidents was common practice. The Assyrians would leave the skin to tan on their city walls.&lt;ref name=HLR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516 |title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? &amp;#124; The Record |publisher=[[Harvard Law Record]] |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several claims that the binding of some ancient and medieval books may be made of human skin. Allegedly, a 13th-century bible and a text of the Decretals were bound in human skin. Along with this hearsay, there are reports of copies of the [[French Constitution of 1793|1793 French Constitution]] being written on human skin and 19th-century anatomy textbooks being symbolically bound in skin.&lt;ref name=HLR/&gt;

==Nazi era==

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, claims circulated that [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], had possessed lampshades made of human skin, and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her conviction for war crimes, General [[Lucius D. Clay]], the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, reduced her sentence to four years' prison on the grounds "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected [[Nazi concentration camp]] inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Edward Smith]] in his biography, ''Lucius D. Clay, an American Life'', reported that the general had maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by General Clay years later:

:There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lamp shades were made out of goat skin.&lt;ref name="GoatSkin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lucius D. Clay: An American Life | publisher=Macmillan | author=Smith, Jean Edward | year=1990 | pages=301 | isbn=9780805009996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges were made once more when she was rearrested, but again were found to be groundless.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"/&gt; Journalist Mark Jacobson claims to be in possession of this lampshade, but those claims are disputed.&lt;ref name="SANTORO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santoro|first1=Gene|title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobson|first1=Mark|title=The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416566304|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ay4YLEhc_rUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Lampshade:+A+Holocaust+Detective+Story&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_qiC5PrXAhVCE7wKHb1TA6gQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Lampshade%3A%20A%20Holocaust%20Detective%20Story&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ed Gein==
[[Ed Gein]] was a killer and body snatcher, active in the 1950s, who made trophies from corpses he stole from a local graveyard. When he was finally arrested, a search of the premises revealed, among other disturbing artifacts, a lampshade made out of human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chloe Castleden|title=Ed Gein: The Psycho Cannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3_Wx5nIt_UC&amp;pg=PP11|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Limited|isbn=978-1-78033-341-0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Gelbin, Cathy, "Metaphors of Genocide", in Duttinger et al (ed), ''Performance and Performativity in German Cultural Studies'', Peter Lang, 2003, p.233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=December 2017}}
In a 1970 episode of the first series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketch "Mr. Hitler and the Minehead by-election", [[Adolf Hitler]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) says, "If he opens his big mouth again ... it's lampshade time!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 [[London Weekend Television]] drama ''[[The Death of Adolf Hitler]]'', Doctor [[Karl Gebhardt]] (played by [[Ray McAnally]]) claims to Hitler ([[Frank Finlay]]) that the lampshade in his office in the [[Führerbunker]] is made of human skin. Hitler is disgusted and flies into a rage, violently throwing the lamp away, showing Hitler's cognitive dissonance between his personal morality and the twisted inhumanity of his orders.

In 1995, [[August Kreis III]] was ejected from the set of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' after telling the host "Your relatives – weren't they all turned into [[soap made from human corpses|soap]] or lampshades?... I've got your mom in the trunk of my car".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/12/15/neo-nazi-leader-august-kreis-sentenced-for-fraud/ |title=Neo-Nazi Leader August Kreis Sentenced for Fraud |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |author=Lenz, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Skinned" from the 1995 [[Blind Melon]] album ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]'' is about Ed Gein and contains the lyrics "I'll make a lampshade of durable skin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Blind-melon-skinned-lyrics|title=Skinned|last=|first=|date=|website=genius.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human lampshade appears in [[Ken Russell]]'s 2007 short satire ''[[A Kitten for Hitler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |author2=Nayeri, Farah |first=Ian |title=U.K. Provocateur Ken Russell, Director of ‘Tommy,’ Dies at 84 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |accessdate=22 December 2012 |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185113/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Lenny, an American Jewish boy, who has a [[Nazi symbolism|swastika]]-shaped [[birthmark]], tries to soften Hitler's heart by giving him a kitten, but when Hitler sees the birthmark, he has [[Eva Braun]] kill Lenny to make him into a lampshade for their bedside table lamp. Near the end of the film, in what appears to be [[miracle#Judaism|an act of God]], the swastika transforms into the [[Star of David]].

In 2010 author [[Mark Jacobson]] published ''[[The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans]]''. In it he described how after [[Hurricane Katrina]] he uncovered a lamp which he believed to be made of human skin, and which may have come from a Nazi [[concentration camp]]. Initial flawed DNA testing appeared to show this was the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Santoro |first=Gene |url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm |title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust |publisher=Historynet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later more sophisticated testing proved it was cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Human Lampshade: A Holocaust Mystery|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNb1MZbqalk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2294|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a human-skin lamp appeared in the [[I Am Anne Frank (American Horror Story)|''I Am Anne Frank'']] episode of ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]''.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37631">'''Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development''' constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist [[Jean Piaget]]. [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref name="Crain"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crain |first=William C. |title=Theories of Development |edition=2Rev |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1985 |isbn=0-13-913617-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1958 and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.

The theory holds that [[moral reasoning]], the basis for [[ethics|ethical]] behavior, has six identifiable [[constructivism (learning theory)|developmental stages]], each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="highest stage"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | year=1973 | pages=630–646 | doi=10.2307/2025030 | issue=18 | publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18 | jstor=2025030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,&lt;ref name="piaget"&gt;{{cite book | last=Piaget | first=Jean | title=The Moral Judgment of the Child | publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co. | location=London | year=1932 |isbn=0-02-925240-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,&lt;ref name="dissertation"&gt;{{cite thesis | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16 | type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=University of Chicago | year=1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.&lt;ref name="philmoral"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= Essays on Moral Development, Vol. I: The Philosophy of Moral Development |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | authorlink=Lawrence Kohlberg |author2=Charles Levine |author3=Alexandra Hewer  | title=Moral stages : a current formulation and a response to critics | publisher=Karger | location=Basel, NY | year=1983 |isbn=3-8055-3716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels of morality: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional morality.

For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the [[Heinz dilemma]], and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt; and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.&lt;ref name="istoought"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= From ''Is'' to ''Ought'': How to Commit the Naturalistic Fallacy and Get Away with It in the Study of Moral Development |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |editor-first=T. | editor-last=Lickona |title=Moral Development and Behavior: Theory, Research and Social Issues |publisher=Rinehart and Winston |location=Holt, NY |year=1976 |chapter= Moral stages and moralization: The cognitive-developmental approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement"&gt;{{cite book |last=Colby |first=Anne |author2=Kohlberg, L.  |title=The Measurement of Moral Judgment Vol. 2: Standard Issue Scoring Manual |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987 | isbn=0-521-24447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;&lt;ref name="gilligan"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gilligan | first=Carol | title=[[In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and Morality]] | journal=Harvard Educational Review | volume=47 | issue=4 | year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly ''post hoc'' rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists) of essentially intuitive decisions.&lt;ref name=Haidt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=J|title=The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to  moral judgment|journal=Psychological Review|year=2001|volume=108|pages=814–834 |url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/home.html|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory,&lt;!-- incomplete citation: "Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Reasoning
Encyclopedia of Childhood and Adolescence" Dianne K. Daeg de Mott --&gt; and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haggbloom | first1 = S.J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 139–15 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm Section on Kohlberg's stages from "Theories of Development" by W.C. Crain (1985)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt; Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a [[Theory of cognitive development#Piaget's four stages|stage model]], as described in his [[theory of cognitive development]], it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Lawrence, J. |date=February 1989 |title=A longitudinal study of moral reasoning |journal=Child Development |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=157–166 |doi=10.2307/1131081 |pmid=2702866 |publisher=Child Development, Vol. 60, No. 1 |jstor=1131081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colby"&gt;

The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.

===Pre-conventional===
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement"/&gt;

In '''Stage one''' (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.&lt;ref name="socialpersonalitydev"&gt;{{cite book | last=Shaffer | first=David R. | title=Social and Personality Development | edition=5th | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year=2004 |isbn=0-534-60700-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.&lt;ref name="edmoraldevfaith"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=Education, Moral Development and Faith | journal=Journal of Moral Education | volume=4 | date=Oct 1974 | pages=5–16 | doi=10.1080/0305724740040102 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is "deference to superior power or prestige".&lt;ref name="edmoraldevfaith" /&gt;

An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.

'''Stage two''' (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or [[intrinsic]] respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as [[moral relativism|morally relative]].

An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.

===Conventional===
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of [[adolescents]] and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

In '''Stage three''' (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt; having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "[[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]]". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt;

In '''Stage four''' (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, [[dictum]]s, and [[social convention]]s because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; [[culpability]] is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.&lt;ref name="highest stage" /&gt;

===Post-conventional===
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual's own perspective may take precedence over society's view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

In '''Stage five''' (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as [[social contract]]s rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet "the greatest good for the greatest number of people".&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; This is achieved through [[majority decision]] and inevitable [[compromise]]. [[Democratic government]] is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.

In '''Stage six''' (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on [[abstraction|abstract reasoning]] using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. [[Natural and legal rights|Legal rights]] are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for [[deontology|deontic]] moral action. Decisions are not reached [[hypothetical imperative|hypothetically]] in a conditional way but rather [[categorical imperative|categorically]] in an absolute way, as in the [[Kantian ethics|philosophy of Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="kant"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]] | title=[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]| publisher=Harper and Row Publishers, Inc | year=1964| isbn=0-06-131159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another's shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.&lt;ref name="rawls"&gt;* {{cite book | last=Rawls | first=John | authorlink=John Rawls | title=[[A Theory of Justice]] | publisher=Belkap Press of Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=1971 |isbn=0-674-01772-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; Touro College Researcher Arthur P. Sullivan helped  support the accuracy of Kohlberg's first five stages through data analysis, but could not provide statistical evidence for the existence of Kohlberg's sixth stage. Therefore, it is difficult to define/recognize as a concrete stage in moral development.

===Further stages===
In his empirical studies of individuals throughout their life, Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. &lt;!-- This was a startling result, which conflicted with his view of the stages as rigid and invariant. --&gt; This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to five, that shared characteristics of both.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt; Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.&lt;ref name="moralization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt;

Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kohlberg | first1= Lawrence | last2=Power| first2=Clark | editor-first=Lawrence | editor-last=Kohlberg| title=Essays on Moral Development Vol. I: Philosophy of Moral Development | publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA | year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 |chapter= Moral Development, Religious Thinking, and the Question of a Seventh Stage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining [[empirical evidence]] for even a sixth stage,&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.&lt;ref name="philmoral" /&gt;

==Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)==

Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral ''reasonings'' adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the ''form and structure'' of moral arguments is independent of the ''content'' of those arguments, a position he calls "[[formalism (philosophy)|formalism]]".&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt;

Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]&lt;ref name="kant" /&gt; and [[eudaimonia]].

Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "[[moral universalism]]"):&lt;ref name="istoought" /&gt; there can be no [[moral relativism|relativism]]. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are [[prescriptivity|prescriptive]]. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.

According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.&lt;ref name="colby" /&gt; The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.

===Formal elements===
[[Image:Kohlberg moral stages vop.gif|right]]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "[[justice operation]]". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "[[egalitarianism|equality]]", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "[[ethic of reciprocity|reciprocity]]", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral [[musical chairs]]").&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt;

Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely [[Allocentrism|socio-centric]].&lt;ref name="KohlLevineHewer" /&gt; Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.

==Examples of applied moral dilemmas==
Kohlberg established the ''Moral Judgement Interview'' in his original 1958 dissertation.&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt; During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded [[structured interview|semi-structured interview]], the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of [[open-ended question]]s, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="measurement" /&gt;

A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the [[Heinz dilemma|druggist's dilemma]]: ''Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe''.&lt;ref name="philmoral" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. [[Carol Gilligan]] has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly [[androcentrism|androcentric]].&lt;ref name="gilligan"/&gt; Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.&lt;ref name=Woolfolk&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolfolk|first=Anita|title=Educational Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780132893589|pages=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zp6aMQEACAAJ&amp;dq=anita+woolfolk+educational+psychology+12th+edition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g2ycUJr7KLCz0QGblIC4BA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=Bruce|title=Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0321202805|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZujkAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=consider+ethics+waller+2005&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QbapU8m3AoePqga8tYDwAQ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the [[ethics of care|ethics of caring]].&lt;ref name="gilligan" /&gt; Critics such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, ''The War Against Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.&lt;ref name="Crain" /&gt; Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.&lt;ref name="Harkness"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Harkness| first1=Sara | first2=Carolyn P. | last2=Edwards | first3=Charles M. | last3=Super | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Developmental Psychology | volume=17 | year=1981 | pages=595–603 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.5.595 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.&lt;ref name="Crain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kohlberg/gilligan"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= The Adolescent as a Philosopher: The Discovery of the Self in a Postconventional World |publisher= Daedalus |year= 1971|author2=Carol Gilligan  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.&lt;ref name=Parke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parke|first1=R. D.|last2=Gauvain|first2=M.|last3=Schmuckler|first3=M. A.|title=Child psychology : a contemporary viewpoint|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|location=Whitby, ON|isbn=0070782385|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e. stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e. stage four).&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carpendale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpendale|first=J|title=Kohlberg and Piaget on Stages and Moral Reasoning|journal=Developmental Review|date=1 June 2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=181–205|doi=10.1006/drev.1999.0500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt; Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.&lt;ref name=Carpendale/&gt; This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.&lt;ref name=Parke/&gt; Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=Dennis L.|author2=Denton, Kathy |title=Toward a More Pragmatic Approach to Morality: A Critical Evaluation of Kohlberg's Model.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 2005|volume=112|issue=3|pages=629–649|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.3.629|url=https://www.sfu.ca/psyc/faculty/krebs/publications/Toward%20a%20More%20Pragmatic%20Approach%20to%20Morality.pdf|pmid=16060754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of [[formal reasoning]]. [[Social intuitionism|Social intuitionists]] such as [[Jonathan Haidt]], for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, [[human rights]], or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other [[rationalist]] psychologists could be considered ''[[post hoc theorizing|post hoc]]'' rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.&lt;ref name=Haidt /&gt;

==Continued relevance==
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the ''[[Defining Issues Test]]'' (''DIT'') created in 1979 by [[James Rest]],&lt;ref name="judgingmoralissues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |title=Development in Judging Moral Issues |year=1979 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-0891-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.&lt;ref name="DIT-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |year=1999 |title=DIT-2: Devising and testing a new instrument of moral judgment |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=644–659 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.4.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the [[Test validity|validity]] criteria by using a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] test, the [[Likert scale]], to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.&lt;ref name="CSEDdilemma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforthestudyofethicaldevelopment.net/DIT%20--Sample%20Dilemma.htm |title=Center for the Study of Ethical Development |accessdate=2006-12-05 |format=Website |work=DIT --Sample Dilemma: Heinz and the Drug |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629030232/http://www.centerforthestudyofethicaldevelopment.net/DIT%20--Sample%20Dilemma.htm |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".&lt;ref name="neokohlbergian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |year=1999 |title=A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach: The DIT and Schema Theory |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=291–324 |doi=10.1023/A:1022053215271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postconventional"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rest |first1=James |authorlink1=James Rest |last2=Narvaez|first2=D.|last3=Bebeau|first3=M.|last4=Thoma|first4=S. |title=Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach |year=1999 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3285-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the ''DIT'' was revised as the ''DIT-2'';&lt;ref name="DIT-2" /&gt; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,&lt;ref name="restresearchtheory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rest |first=James |authorlink=James Rest |others=In collaboration with Barnett, R.; Bebeau, M.; Deemer, D.; Getz, I.; Moon, Y.; Spickelmeier, J.; Thoma, S. and Volker, J. |title=Moral development: Advances in research and theory |year=1986 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-92254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as divinity, politics, and medicine.&lt;ref name="DITdivinitystudents"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bunch |first=Wilton H. |year=2005|title=Changing moral judgement in divinity students |journal=Journal of Moral Education |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=363–370|doi=10.1080/03057240500211543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DITpolitical"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muhlberger |first=P. |year=2000 |title=Moral reasoning effects on political participation |journal=Political Psychology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=667–695 |doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIThealthstudents"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hedl |first1=John J.|last2=Glazer|first2=H.|last3=Chan|first3=F.|year=2005 |title=Improving the Moral Reasoning of Allied Health Students |journal=Journal of Allied Health |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=121–122 |pmid=16032920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the book by Robert Phillipson|Linguistic Imperialism}}
'''Linguistic imperialism''', or '''language imperialism''', a phenomenon that occasionally occurs, defined as "the transfer of a dominant [[language]] to other people". This language "transfer" comes about because of [[imperialism]]. The transfer is considered to be a demonstration of [[Power in international relations|power]]—traditionally, [[Armed forces|military power]] but also, in the modern world, [[economic power]]—and aspects of the dominant [[culture]] are usually transferred along with the language.

In the modern world, linguistic imperialism may also be considered in the context of international development, affecting the standard by which organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] and the [[World Bank]] evaluate the trustworthiness and value of providing structural adjustment loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Master|first=Peter|date=1998-01-01|title=Positive and Negative Aspects of the Dominance of English|jstor=3588002|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=32|issue=4|pages=716–727|doi=10.2307/3588002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, linguistic imperialism has attracted attention among scholars of [[applied linguistics]]. In particular, [[Robert Phillipson]]'s 1992 book, ''Linguistic Imperialism'', has led to considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings. Phillipson found denunciations of linguistic imperialism that dated back to Nazi critiques of the [[British Council]] (European aristocracy was at the time agreeing on the use of English), and to Soviet analyses of [[English language|English]] as the language of world [[capitalism]] and  [[Hegemony|world domination]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Robert (1992), p36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, criticism of English as a world language is rooted in [[anti-globalism]].

{{Undue weight section|date=August 2015}}
Phillipson defines English linguistic imperialism as "the dominance of English... asserted and maintained by the establishment and continuous reconstitution of structural and cultural inequalities between English and other languages."&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Robert (1992), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=4jVeGWtzQ1oC&amp;pg=PA47 47].&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillipson's theory supports the historic spread of English  as an international language and that language's continued dominance, particularly in [[postcolonial]] settings such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Uganda]], [[Zimbabwe]], etc., but also increasingly in "neo-colonial" settings such as continental [[Europe]]. His theory draws mainly on [[Johan Galtung]]'s [[imperialism]] theory, [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s social theory, and in particular on his notion of [[cultural hegemony]].

A central theme of Phillipson's theory is the complex hegemonic processes{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} which, he asserts, continue to sustain the pre-eminence of English in the world today. His book analyzes the [[British Council]]'s use of rhetoric to promote English, and discusses key tenets of English [[applied linguistics]] and English-language-teaching methodology. These tenets hold that:

* English is best taught [[monolingual]]ly ("the monolingual fallacy");
* the ideal teacher is a [[native speaker]] ("the native-speaker fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* the earlier English is taught, the better the results ("the early-start fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* the more English is taught, the better the results ("the maximum-exposure fallacy");{{Clarify|date=August 2015|Why is this fallacious?}}
* if other languages are used much, standards of English will drop ("the subtractive fallacy").

According to Phillipson, those who promote English—organizations such as the British Council, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and individuals such as operators of English-language schools—use three types of argument:
* ''Intrinsic'' arguments describe the English language as providential, rich, noble and interesting. Such arguments tend to assert what English ''is'' and what other languages ''are not''.
* ''Extrinsic'' arguments point out that English is well-established: that it has many speakers, and that there are trained teachers and a wealth of teaching material. 
* ''Functional'' arguments emphasize the usefulness of English as a gateway to the world.

Other arguments for English are
* its economic utility: it enables people to operate technology;
* its ideological function: it stands for modernity;
* its status as symbol for material advance and efficiency.

Another theme in Phillipson's work is "[[linguicism]]"—the species of [[prejudice]] that leads to [[endangered languages]] becoming extinct or losing their local eminence due to the rise and competing prominence of English.

== Other languages ==

In 1976, Black school children in [[Soweto]] [[Soweto uprising|protested]] at being taught in [[Afrikaans]], which had been pushed by the [[Apartheid]] authorities concerned at the growing refusal of the Black population to speak it. They reasoned that by only having access to Afrikaner resources the South African government could control them more closely than having access to a global language i.e. [[English language|English]]. 176 children died for the right to be taught in English. The Uprising became a turning point in the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|overthrow of Apartheid]] years later.

At various times, especially in colonial settings or where a dominant culture has sought to unify a region under its control, a similar phenomenon has arisen. In the [[Roman Empire]], [[Latin]]—originally the language of a limited region in central Italy—was imposed first on the rest of Italy and later on large parts of Europe, largely displacing previous languages spoken there, while in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] Latin was merely dominant until it and the native languages were displaced by [[Arabization]].

[[Anatolia]] was similarly diverse linguistically when it was ruled by small native states.  Under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic empires]], the language of the conqueror served as the ''[[lingua franca]]''.  The indigenous [[Anatolian languages]] disappeared.

In the [[Far East]], [[Africa]] and [[South America]], regional languages have been or are being coercively replaced or marginalized by the language of a dominant culture—[[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[varieties of Chinese|regional Chinese varieties]] by [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]] by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]] by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] by [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Philippine languages]] by [[Filipino language|Filipino/Tagalog]] and so on. [[Arabization]] has eliminated many indigenous languages in [[North Africa]], and restricted [[Coptic language|Coptic]] to sacred use.

The English language during the [[Middle Ages]] was an object of linguistic imperialism by the [[French language]], particularly following the [[Norman conquest]]. For hundreds of years, French or [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] was the language of administration (''See [[Law French]]'') and therefore a language of superior status in England. Latin remained the language of the church and of learning. Although many words introduced by the Normans are today indistinguishable by most English-speakers from native [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words, later-learned [[loanword]]s derived from Latin or French often have a more cultured sound to a native English-speaker.

Following the establishment of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] over much of present-day [[Germany]] and [[Central Europe]], the [[German language]] and its dialects became the preferred language of many Central-European nobility. With varying success, German spread across much of Central and [[Eastern Europe]] as a language of trade and status. This ended with [[World War II]] (''See also [[Germanization]].'').

French too has expanded. Languages such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] are to a great extent marginalised in France.  This process, known as [[Francization]], often causes resistance amongst the subject peoples, leading to demands for independence.  Examples of this can still be found in [[Brittany]] and [[Flanders]] ([[Belgium]]).

Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese colonization, made these languages prevalent in [[South America]] and in parts of [[Africa]],  [[Asia]] (the [[Philippines]]), [[Macau]] and in former times in [[Formosa]].  In Iberia, [[Castilian Spanish]], as spoken in the [[kingdom of Castile]] was imposed on other [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|regions of Spain]], initially by Germanic [[Habsburg Spain]] and later more fervently by the French [[Bourbon Spain]]; it was labeled "the companion of the Empire" by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (1492) in the introduction to his ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]''. Russian linguistic imperialism can be detected in [[Belarus]] both in the former dispute over the name of the country (Belarus vs Belorussia) and in the common spelling of the name of their president. English transcription has overtaken the Russian form [[Alexander Lukashenko]] instead of Belarusian form Alyaksandr Lukashenka.

==Critique==
Many scholars have participated in lively discussions of Phillipson's claims. Alan Davies, for instance, envisions the spectre of Phillipson haunting the Department of Applied Linguistics in Edinburgh:

{{Quote|'Round up the usual suspects', he cries, outing those who have pretended all these years merely to teach applied linguistics, but who have really been plotting with the British Council to take over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies (1996), p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Davies, two cultures inhabit linguistic imperialism: one, a culture of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] ("colonies should never have happened"); the other, that of romantic despair ("we shouldn't be doing what we are doing"). Rajagopalan goes a step farther and maintains that Phillipson's book has led to a guilt complex among [[English language learning and teaching]] (ELT) professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Rajagopalan (1999), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies also argues that Phillipson's claims are not [[falsifiable]]: what "if the dominated... wanted to adopt English and continue to want to keep it? RP's unfalsifiable answer must be that they don't, they can't, they've been persuaded against their better interests."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1996), p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been argued that Phillipson's theory is patronizing in the sense that it does not regard developing countries as being capable of independent decision-making (to adopt or not to adopt ELT). In the context of [[Nigeria]], Bisong holds that people in the "[[Periphery countries|periphery]]" use English pragmatically—they send their children to English-language schools precisely because they want them to grow up multilingual. Regarding Phillipson, Bisong maintains that "to interpret such actions as emanating from people who are victims of Centre linguistic imperialism is to bend sociolinguistic evidence to suit a preconceived thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Bisong (1995 [1994]), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; If English should be abolished because it is foreign, Bisong argues, then Nigeria itself would also have to be dissolved, because it was conceived as a colonial structure.

Furthermore, the assumption that the English language itself is imperialistic has come under attack. [[Henry Widdowson]] has argued that  "there is a fundamental contradiction in the idea that the language of itself exerts hegemonic control: namely that if this were the case, you would never be able to challenge such control".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Widdowson (1998a), p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the idea that the promotion of English necessarily implies a demotion of local languages has been challenged. Holborrow points out that "not all Englishes in the centre dominate, nor are all speakers in the [[Periphery countries|periphery]] equally discriminated against".&lt;ref&gt;Holborrow (1993), p. 359; see also Bisong (1995 [1994]), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish English]], for instance, could be regarded as a non-dominant centre variety of English.

Thus it could be argued that, while those who follow Phillipson see choices about language as externally imposed, the other camp sees them as decisions made by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Those who support the arguments favoring the existence of linguistic imperialism claim that arguments against it are often advanced by [[monolingual]] native-speakers of English who may see the current status of English as a fact worthy of celebration.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In contrast, it has been argued that those who see the increasing spread of English in the world as a worrying development (that marginalizes the status of local and regional languages as well as potentially undermining or eroding cultural values) are likely to be far more receptive to Phillipson's views. [[Alastair Pennycook]], [[Suresh Canagarajah]], [[Adrian Holliday]] and [[Julian Edge]] broadly fall into this group and are often described as [[critical applied linguistics|critical applied linguists]].

However, [[Henry Widdowson]]’s remarks on [[critical discourse analysis]] may also be applied to the critical applied linguists:

{{Quote|It ought surely to be possible to say that an argument is confused, or an analysis flawed, without denying the justice of the cause they support. My view would be that if a case is just then we should look for ways of supporting it by coherent argument... And I would indeed argue that to do otherwise is to do a disservice to the cause. For the procedures of ideological exposure by expedient analysis... can, of course be taken up to further any cause, right wing as well as left.... If you have the conviction and commitment, you will always find your witch.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Widdowson (1998b), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a response to English linguistic imperialism, [[anglicisation#Place names|de-anglicisation]] became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html | title=The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland | first=Douglas | last=Hyde | date=25 November 1892 | accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title       = De-Anglicisation - Free Online Dictionary
| url         = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/de-anglicization 
| publisher   =
| accessdate  = 
| quote       = the elimination of English influence, language, customs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following centuries of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English rule in Ireland]], an argument for de-anglicisation was delivered before the Irish National Literary Society in Dublin, 25 November 1892; "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt; Despite its status as an [[official language]], the Irish language has been reduced to a [[minority language]] in Ireland as a result of centuries of English rule, as is the case in North America where their [[indigenous languages]] have been replaced by that of the colonists, and continued to decline even after independence.

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appropriation==
Some who reject the concept of linguistic imperialism argue that the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Spichtinger (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;—that English is used around the world ''for local purposes''.  In addition to the example of Nigeria,  above, the following examples have been given:

* Demonstrators in non-English-speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV audiences around the globe. In some cases, the demonstrator may not even understand what the sign he is carrying says.
* Bobda shows how [[Cameroon]] has moved away from a mono-cultural, Anglo-centered way of teaching English and has gradually accommodated teaching materials to a Cameroonian context. Non-Western topics are treated, such as rule by [[emir]]s, [[traditional medicine]], and [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobda (1997), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Bobda argues for bi-cultural, Cameroonian and Anglo-American education.&lt;ref&gt;Bobda (1997), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kramsch and Sullivan describe how Western methodology and textbooks have been appropriated to suit local [[Vietnamese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramsch and Sullivan (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Pakistan]]i textbook ''Primary Stage English'' includes lessons such as "Pakistan, My Country", "Our Flag," and "Our Great Leader",&lt;ref&gt;Malik (1993), pp. 5, 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; which might sound [[jingoistic]] to western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between ELT, patriotism and the [[Muslim]] faith is seen as an aim of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: "The board... takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the student's] home lands."&lt;ref&gt;Punjab Text Book Board (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an "internationalization" of English might also create new possibilities for English native-speakers. McCabe elaborates:

{{Quote|...whereas for two centuries we exported our language and our customs in hot pursuit of... fresh markets, we now find that our language and our customs are returned to us but altered so that they can be used by others... so that our own language and culture discover new possibilities, fresh contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe (1985), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Finland]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is a '''mandatory school subject''' for [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking pupils in the last four years of the [[Education in Finland|primary education]] (grades 6 to 9). This so-called ''other domestic language'' is also mandatory in [[high school]]s, [[vocational school]]s, and [[vocational university|vocational universities]]. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called ''public servant's Swedish''). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161013132323/http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html Swedophone population]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.

According to the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]], both [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be able to serve citizens in Swedish. Military service is not required in the autonomous region of [[Åland]]. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is ''the other domestic language''. However, the requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as ''pakkoruotsi'', a somewhat charged term in Finnish meaning "mandatory Swedish", or "enforced Swedish".

== Overview ==
The status of Swedish as a national language in Finland is defined by the Finnish constitution. There was migration of Swedish-speaking peasants to some Finnish coastal areas during the Middle Ages. During this period, when Finland was ruled by Sweden, Swedish language became part of the culture in the coastal areas. Swedish was also the language of the ruling class. The Finnish language was forbidden an official status alongside Swedish until the period of [[Russian Empire|Russian rule]] (1809–1917), in 1860. The autonomous [[Åland Islands]] (pop. 26,000, 95% Swedish, 5% Finnish) has only one official language, Swedish, and the speaking of Finnish between employees is forbidden in some public services.

In [[Mainland Finland]] both official languages, Finnish and Swedish, are mandatory subjects for pupils in [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools. The Swedish test of the [[Abitur|Matriculation Examination]] was made voluntary in 2004, although all university graduates must demonstrate that their skills in the other official language meet the standard required of all academically educated public servants. Usually this means the completion of a so-called ''public servant's Swedish'' test. The Swedish language is also one of the main agendas of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]] that has been a minor partner in most [[Cabinet of Finland|Cabinets]] since Finland's independence, and in all Cabinets between 1972 and 2015.

Supporters of Mandatory Swedish argue that it brings Finland closer to the [[Nordic countries]], since Swedish is quite similar to, and to some extent [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with, both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], while Finnish belongs to the unrelated [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]] group. Supporters also say that studying Swedish makes it easier to learn other [[Germanic languages]], such as English and German. Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.

== History ==
{{Main|Finland's language strife}}
The area that today is Finland was an integral part of [[Sweden proper]] from the Middle Ages to the end of the [[Finnish War]] in 1809. Swedish migrants settled in coastal areas, and the language of administration was Swedish. This prompted many Finnish-speakers to learn Swedish in hopes of improving their social status, and some switched to Swedish altogether.

As a result of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar established the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.

When Finland became autonomous there was a big interest in creating a new national identity. There was an immense interest in the Finnish language and Finnish culture in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class. At some point the [[Fennoman]] movement arose, that thought that the country should be a united [[nationalism|nation]], with only one language, and, as a reaction, the [[Svecoman]] movement, that was afraid that abandoning Swedish would lead to [[slavicisation]] or worse.

However, during the 1860s, under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], it was decided that legal equality between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher [[estates of the realm]] were abolished, a modern parliament based on [[universal suffrage]] was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.

In the current form, mandatory Swedish was implemented as a part of the modernisation of the [[Education in Finland|educational system]] in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in ''oppikoulu'', a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common ''kansakoulu''. The introduction of the ''peruskoulu'' (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained compulsory. This was motivated by the possibility that any student could become a public official and would thus be required to know Swedish.

== Current situation ==
A compulsory introductory course to Swedish for all pupils in [[primary education]] was introduced in the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (''peruskoulu, grundskola'') was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[tertiary education]]. Administrative services have, since the end of the 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with [[Western world|the Western world]] through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was a part of the [[Nordic countries]], and not an [[Eastern Bloc]] country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.

In the [[secondary education|upper secondary general school]] all the students learn at least two languages besides their mother tongue, one of which is the other domestic language, except for people studying some other language as mother tongue (e.g. immigrants and those studying [[Sami languages|Sami]]). Finnish speakers take Swedish, and vice versa. According to [[Statistics Finland]], practically all the students take [[English language|English]], either as a compulsory or an optional language. There is also a possibility to take one or more extra foreign languages. Despite Finland being a neighbour of Russia, Russian is not taught in most schools of Finland, and only 1.5% of Finns know some Russian. The hindrances are cultural and political, as there has been relatively little cultural exchange between the Finns and Russians in the 20th century, and Finland's relations with the Soviet Union were hostile from the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918) until [[World War II]] (1939–1944).

The arrangement of "mandatory Swedish and practically-mandatory English" has been criticized, because it reduces the diversity of the language skills of the population.&lt;ref&gt; Hult, F.M., &amp; Pietikäinen, S. (2014). Shaping discourses of multilingualism through a language ideological debate: The case of Swedish in Finland. ''Journal of Language and Politics'', 13, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU target is to teach two foreign languages. As English is an overwhelmingly popular choice, it has been suggested by, for example, the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] that keeping Swedish compulsory directly prevents choosing other languages, such as Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EK: Pakkoruotsista luovuttava valintamahdollisuuksien lisäämiseksi |first=Liiten |last=Marjukka |newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat |date=June 1, 2010 |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013131532/http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies into opinions regarding mandatory Swedish have been made with various results. The big differences between studies exemplifies the problems in conducting a neutral and broad study without asking [[leading question]]s on the particular subject. Furthermore, some of the studies have been commissioned by organizations that have politically partisan views on the subject of mandatory Swedish.

Between 1990 and 2003 Taloustutkimus Oy conducted a series of more than ten surveys for [[Association of Finnish Culture and Identity|Suomalaisuuden liitto]], an organisation opposing mandatory Swedish. According to these surveys, 66–72% of Finns were "in favour of voluntary Swedish education or against mandatory Swedish education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207045737/http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2004 |title=Mandatory Swedish |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suomen Gallup]]'s 2003 survey concluded that while a small majority supported "compulsory second domestic language studying", it was opposed by 42% of Finns while 25% did not want both Finnish and Swedish to be official languages of Finland. This study was commissioned by [[Yle]], the Finnish publicly funded national broadcasting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suomen Gallupin tutkimus 2003 |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430083604/http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The question posed to those surveyed was very verbose in comparison to the Taloustutkimus surveys on the same subject. The question did not include the word "Swedish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In 1992 a study by ''Valitut Palat'' (the Finnish edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'') concluded that 90 percent of the parents of third to fourth grade pupils "supported a reduction of compulsory languages" (only Finnish and Swedish are compulsory). When ''Valitut Palat'' did a new survey in 2003 it found 64% opposing mandatory Swedish, and 25% not wanting to have two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html Valittujen Palojen tutkimus 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020523/http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html |date=2007-09-28 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement|IEA]] study (2000) revealed that 67% of young people studying in Finnish-speaking schools wanted to make Swedish a voluntary subject. The most politically aware youths were the most critical against Swedishness in this study.&lt;ref&gt;IEA/Civic Education Study: [http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm Nuorten käsityksiä Ruotsista ja ruotsalaisuudesta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105175621/http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm |date=2006-01-05 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 1997 by [[Folktinget]], an official consultative organisation representing Finland's Swedish-speakers, concluded that 70% of the Finnish-speaking population  considered "Swedish a vital and important part of Finnish society." This study also indicated that the most negative opinions about mandatory Swedish were found among those with academic degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Vårt land, vårt språk – kahden kielen Kansa. rapport 35. {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Taloustutkimus for Yle in 2013 indicated that 63 percent of respondents were opposed to mandatory Swedish. Further, the study indicated that among the supporters of the different political parties, only the supporters of the Swedish People's Party and the Green League favoured retaining mandatory Swedish teaching. A majority of supporters in all the other parties wanted Swedish teaching to be voluntary – the supporters of the Finns Party and the Social Democrats were most heavily in favour of making Swedish voluntary (76 and 73 percent respectively).&lt;ref name="yle.fi"/&gt;

A study conducted by [[Åbo Akademi]] in 2014 indicated that 74 percent of Finnish speaking respondents agreed with the statement "The teaching of the Swedish language should be voluntary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.abo.fi/pressmaterial/sprakundersokning_Finska.pdf Tutkimus kartoitti suomalaisten mielipiteitä ruotsin kielestä], Åbo Akademi 22 December 2014, accessed 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
[[Image:Pois pakkoruotsi.svg|thumb|"Away with mandatory Swedish". &lt;br/&gt; A campaign logo against mandatory Swedish.&lt;br/&gt;The character on the logo throws away an [[Å]], a letter found in [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] words, but not in native [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]].]]
In many cases, pupils have negative expectations and experiences of learning Swedish which may foster a negative attitude towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark back to the time when Finland was a part of Sweden (see [[Sweden–Finland]]), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few Swedish-speakers in [[mainland Finland]] outside the coastal area by the [[Baltic Sea]], and thus contact with Swedish-speakers is rare for most Finns. This fact can for some make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.

According to a study published in 2002 students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived Swedish being compulsory lessened their motivation&lt;ref name="lammi"&gt;Lammi, Kati. ''Kielisalkku motivoi ruotsin kielen opiskeluun.'' (''Language portfolio as a tool in promoting motivation in the study of Swedish at senior high school: student and teacher views and experiences.'') Dissertation at [[University of Jyväskylä]], 2002. [https://www.jyu.fi/ajankohtaista/arkisto/2002/11/tiedote-2007-09-18-15-40-42-566699/ Announcement in Finnish and abstract in English])&lt;!-- No such document at URL [http://info.adm.jyu.fi/main/portti/tiedotteet/2002/11/2469/show_announcement] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a ''de facto'' requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and was made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).&lt;ref&gt;[[YLE]]: [http://svenska.yle.fi/nyheter/sok.php?id=203491&amp;lookfor=&amp;sokvariant=arkivet&amp;advanced=yes&amp;antal=10 Svenskan stadigt nedåt i studentskrivningarna]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a lot of criticism of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.

In addition to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, that these persons argue are more important than Swedish in a globalized world. University students are required not only to master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two "voluntarily chosen" languages must be Swedish and English. Despite being a neighbour of Russia, it is in practice possible to study Russian only in some schools (due to low interest or it not being offered); only 1.5% of the Finns have a good knowledge of Russian. Also very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same [[Finnic languages|Finnic language group]] as Finnish, and national language of Finland's southern neighbour [[Estonia]], although Finnish is popular in Estonia.

Sentiments toward mandatory Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, while others oppose it. There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure the lawmakers to abolish mandatory Swedish, but to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition remains strong enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.

Mandatory Swedish is supported by most political parties in Finland, like the [[National Coalition Party]], the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] and the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]]. The [[Finns Party]] opposes mandatory Swedish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 Finns Party electoral programme, 2011, s. 26-27] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928083239/http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 |date=2013-09-28 }}, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and so does the youth wing of the National Coalition Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokoomusnuoret.fi/kannanotot/2013/03/kokoomusnuoret-kannattavat-vapaaehtoista-kieltenopiskelua/ Kokoomusnuoret kannattaa vapaaehtoista kieltenopiskelua] 4 March 2013, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] came out in favour of making Swedish teaching voluntary. They referred to a study which indicated that in the future Swedish will be only the tenth most important language to Finnish companies, when they are considering the language skills of their potential employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/elinkeinoelama-ajaa-pakkoruotsin-poistoa---tulevaisuudessa-tarvitaan-portugalia-/1904284 Elinkeinoelämä ajaa pakkoruotsin poistoa – tulevaisuudessa tarvitaan portugalia], MTV Uutiset 13 August 2013, accessed 23 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hufvudstadsbladet]], the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favours making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbl.fi/opinion/ledare/2014-11-14/681976/valkommen-kursandring-om-svenskan-av-ek Välkommen kursändring om svenskan av EK], Hufvudstadsbladet November 14, 2014, accessed 29 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Parliament of Finland===
In the 2000s the government dropped the requirement to take Swedish (or Finnish in the case of the Swedish-speaking minority) as part of the high school [[Abitur#Abitur in Finland|matriculation examination]].

In 2014 a citizens' initiative demanding an end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education was brought to the Finnish Parliament. In 2015 the MPs voted, 134 to 48, to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote the MPs voted, 93 to 89, to demand that the government should examine, whether a regional experimentation, where another language would be taught instead of Swedish, is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/ruotsi_sailyy_pakollisena__ita-suomeen_mahdollisuus_kielikokeiluun/7850273 Ruotsi säilyy pakollisena – Itä-Suomeen mahdollisuus kielikokeiluun?], YLE 6 March 2015, accessed 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''motion diagram''' represents the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of an object by displaying its location at various equally spaced times on the same [[diagram]]. Motion diagrams are a pictorial description of an object's motion. They show an object's position and [[velocity]] initially, and present several spots in the center of the diagram. These spots reveal whether or not the object has [[acceleration|accelerated]] or [[deceleration|decelerated]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonham, Scott. (unknown year). Motion diagrams. Manuscript submitted for publication, Department of Physics, Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, KY. Retrieved from http://webphysics.davidson.edu/physlet_resources/western_kentucky/MotionDiagrams.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For simplicity, the object is represented by a simple shape, such as a filled [[circle]]. It contains information about object positions at particular time instances. Therefore, a motion diagram is more informative than a path.

==Viewing Motion Diagrams==
One of the major usages of motion diagrams is to present [[film]] through a series of frames taken by a [[camera]]. Viewing an object on a motion diagram allows one to determine if an object is at a constant [[Rest (physics)|rest]], speeding up, or slowing down. As the frames are taken, it can be assumed that an object is at a constant rest if it occupies the same position over time. It can be assumed that an object is speeding up if there is a visible increase in the space between objects as time
passes.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, R. (2008). Physics for scientists and engineers: a strategic approach. San Francisco,CA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; An object can be assumed to be slowing down if there is a visible decrease in the space between objects as time passes.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, R. (2008). Physics for scientists and engineers: a strategic approach. San Francisco,CA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The objects on the frame come very close together.

{{Video games}}
'''Nonviolent video games''' are [[video game]]s characterized by little or no [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence]]. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with ''comparatively'' little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the [[Christian video game]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Beliefs/story?id=1042784&amp;page=1 Christian Video Games Offer Wholesome Action: Game Makers Hope Non-Violent Alternatives Will Catch On]''. [[ABC News|ABC News/Technology]]. 17 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of games at the fringe of the "non-violence" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.

The purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature. As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased, the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral, political, gender, and medical/psychological quarters. The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors. Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results, a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non-violent alternatives. The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community. Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as "nonviolent" in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre. Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence, many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non-violent games.

==Video game violence and attendant controversies==
{{Main article|Video game controversy#Crime and violence}}

Controversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself. In 1964, [[Marshall McLuhan]], a noted media theorist, suggested in his book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', that "[t]he games people play reveal a great deal about them.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''. Signet. 1964. Re-issued 1994. {{ISBN|0-262-63159-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; " This was built upon in the early 1980s in an anti-video-game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president, Ronnie Lamm, who spoke about her cause on the [[PBS NewsHour|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]] in December 1982.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;Gonzalez, Lauren. ''[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892 When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy]''. [[GameSpot]] feature. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], [[C. Everett Koop]], had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt; Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games, however, effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early 1990s.

Discussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as 1976's ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' arcade game (a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies).  In the 1980s titles such as Exidy's ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986), Namco's ''[[Splatterhouse]]'' (1987) and Midway's ''[[Narc (video game)|NARC]]'' (1988) raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade. Home games such as [[Palace Software|Palace]]'s ''[[Barbarian (Palace Software)|Barbarian]]'' (1987) featured the ability to decapitate opponents. It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra-violent titles were released in the early 1990s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon. In 1992, with [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s release of the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, and then in 1993 with [[id Software|id]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens. Protests and [[List of banned video games|game-bannings]] followed the publicizing of these conflicts, and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the 1990s with the releases of such games as ''[[Dreamweb]]'' (1992), ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' (1992), ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993), ''[[Phantasmagoria (video game)|Phantasmagoria]]'' (1995), ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (1996), ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' (1997), ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon]]'' (1997), ''[[Postal (video game)|Postal]]'' (1997), ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1997), ''[[Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now]]'' (1998), ''[[Blood II: The Chosen]]'' (1998), ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' (1999), and ''[[Requiem: Avenging Angel]]'' (1999) among others.

In April 1999, the fears of the media and violence-watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the shooters in the [[Columbine High School massacre]], revealed that they had been fans of the video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and had even created [[Doom WAD|levels]] for it today dubbed "the [[Harris levels]]". A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides, and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the 1980s received renewed support and interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422082626/http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/familyresources/a/vidgameviolence.htm Violent Video Games Produce Violent Behavior]''. [[About.com]] article. 9 November 2005. Retrieved 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]], led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined, "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence," and that "meta-analysis [had demonstrated that] the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this, the controversies and debate have persisted, and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non-violent video game genre. Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a ''[[Modus tollendo ponens]]'' [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive argument]]. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of [[violence]] which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories:
*Totally non-violent games – Games in which absolutely no violence occurs. This category contains games characterized by lack of the death of characters, lack of sudden noise or movement, and often lack of traditional conflict. (e.g., ''[[Below the Root (video game)|Below the Root]]'' or ''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'')
*Games in which the player acts non-violently – Games where violence occurs to the character-player as a result of environmental hazards or enemies but the character-player's reaction is to run away or otherwise distance himself from the violence.
**Games with environmental hazards only – Games lacking enemies, but containing a potentially violent environment (E.g. ''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'', or ''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'')
**Games with enemies – Games with violent enemies which the player-character must avoid (E.g. the ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series)
*Games in which the player acts non-violently to other sentient beings – Games where a player acts violently against robots or other non-living non-sentient enemies (E.g. ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'')

===Education===
The majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach.In another study performed in Chile, educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms. Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math, reading comprehension, and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmch.tv/mentors_teachers/video_games_benefits.asp "Are there any benefits of playing video games" Accessed 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
{{Main article|Video game effects}}

The [[history of video games|history of video game development]] shares approximate contemporaneity with [[media violence research]] in general. In the early 1960, studies were conducted on the effects of [[adolescents and cartoon violence|violence in cartoons]],&lt;ref&gt;Mussen, P., &amp; Rutherford, E. (1961). ''Effects of aggressive cartoons on children’s aggressive play''. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62, 461–464.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers (especially younger viewers). The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence, and these studies frequently employed the [[social learning theory]] framework developed by [[Albert Bandura]] to explore violent behavioral modeling.

[[File:David Satcher official photo portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher]] has conducted research in the field of video game violence and has concluded that "findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on [youth] violence."&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;]]
With advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence. Although under current debate, a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games, and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., &amp; Bushman, B. J. (2001). ''Effects of violent games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytical review of the scientific literature''. Psychological Science, 12, 353–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory, excitation transfer theory, priming effect and the [[Video game effects#General Aggression Model|General Aggression Model]].  However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.&lt;ref&gt;name=Ferguson &amp; Dyck, 2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Christopher|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violence Behavior|year=2012|issue=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, Stephen J. ''Children, Adolescents, and Media Violence – A Critical Look at the Research''. Media Violence and the Concept of Risk. [[SAGE Publications]]. 2006. p. 276. {{ISBN|0-7619-2976-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Kelly Stephen. ''[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1107102-220029/unrestricted/Meyers_dis.pdf Television and Video Game Violence: Age Differences and the Combined Effects of Passive and Interactive Violent Media]''.

''Interacting with video: Volume 11 of Advances in applied developmental psychology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 1996. {{ISBN|1-56750-152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledgment of the fact that, for better or worse, video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non-violent games.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Mackie, D. (1986). ''Video games and aggression in children''. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 16(8), 726–744.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamborini, R., Eastin, M. S., Skalski, P., Lachlan, K., Fediuk, T.

''Experimental study of the differential effects of playing versus watching violent video games on children’s aggressive behavior''. Aggressive Behavior, 34(3), 256–264.&lt;/ref&gt; As technology has advanced, such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non-violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Arriaga, P., Esteves, F., Caneiro, P., &amp; Monteiro, M. B. (2008). ''Are the effects of unreal violent video games pronounced when playing with a virtual reality system?'' Aggressive Behavior, 34(5), 521–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results have varied, with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games, and other research indicating minimal if any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Craig &amp; Dill, Karen. ''Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life''.

===Lawsuits and legislation===
As research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced, there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video-game-related violence. Similarly, in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and the legislatures of states and other countries, a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games. At times, individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as [[Censorship in Australia#Video games|Australia]], [[Law 3037/2002|Greece]], [[List of banned video games|etc.]]

[[File:JackThompsonAttorney.jpg|thumb|200px|Former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] has filed lawsuits against the makers of violent games, alleging the violent content causes real-world violence.]]

Christian Science Monitor. 19 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Activism|activist]] and (now former) attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] brought suit against [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] on behalf of the victims of [[Heath High School shooting]] in ''[[Heath High School shooting|James v. Meow Media]]''. The suit was dismissed in 2000, absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter's actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16730 Federal appeals panel upholds dismissal of lawsuit against movie, video game makers]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the dismissal, and in 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied [[certiorari]], refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=17477 High court won't revive suit blaming Hollywood for school shooting]''. [[Associated Press]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a "human-like being" that appealed to minors' "morbid interest in violence."&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, Judith F. &amp; Caldwell-Stone, Deborah. ''[http://www.mediainstitute.org/ONLINE/FAM2003/6-a.html Controversial Ruling Finds Video Games Not Protected Speech]''. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of ''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick''&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick'', 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression, however in 2002 the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that "video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment" in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County''.&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'', 200 F. Supp. 2d 1126 (E.D. Mo. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and [[id Software]], the makers of the purportedly violent video game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' by victims of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=13762 Federal suit blames video-game makers for Columbine shooting]''.

The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech. Babcock noted that "it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment, even if they contain violence."&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

In 2003, Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris. ''[http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/20/technology/gaminglaw Wash. bans 'violent' game sales]''. CNN/Money. 21 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "aggressive conflict in which the player kill, injures, or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer." In 2004, this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of ''Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Irwin. ''Case-in-Point''. Legal Television Network. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jack Thompson brought suit against [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' in representation of the victims of the [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]] shooting incident. On 7 November 2005, Thompson withdrew from ''[[Strickland v. Sony]]'', stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore, however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his ''[[pro hac vice]]'' right to practice law in Alabama, following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, Robert.

In 2005, California State Senator, [[Leland Yee]] introduced [[California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793]] which barred ultra-violent video games and mandated the application of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings for video games. Yee, a former [[Developmental psychology|child psychologist]] has [[Leland Yee#Video game controversies|publicly criticized]] such games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', and opposes the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s ''Global Gaming League''. Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in October 2005. By December 2005, both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional, thereby preventing either from going into effect on 1 January 2006. Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois, but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Patrick R.

In 2005, in reaction to such controversial games as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] along with Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Evan Bayh]], introduced the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]] (S.2126), intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4682533.stm Clinton wades into GTA sex storm]''.

In June 2006, the Louisiana case of ''[[Entertainment Software Association v. Foti]]'' struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content. The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the 1st Amendment. Amici filing briefs included [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]].

On 27 September 2006, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the United States [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]] (S.3935). The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030|work = [[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=9 October 2008}} 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Congressman [[Fred Upton]] introduced the [[Video Game Decency Act]] (H.R.6120) to the House.

===Degrees of violence===
{{Main article|Video game content rating system}}

Video game rating boards exist in a number of countries, typically placing restrictions (suggested or under force of law) for content that is violent or sexual in nature. About 5% of games fall into a category rated "mature" and recommended to those 17 years old and older. Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-06-27-supreme-court-violent-video-games_n.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Joan | last1=Biskupic | first2=Mike | last2=Snider | title=Supreme Court rejects ban on violent video games | date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases. This means that non-violent games, which are the least restricted, are available to all players at any age. This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non-violent games, however it also produces something of a [[forbidden fruit]] effect. For this and other reasons, the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. David Walsh (21 March 2000).

[[File:Barbie NES box art.jpg|thumb|150px|Games such as Nintendo's ''[[Barbie (video game)|Barbie]]'' have been designed specifically to target female markets and contains little or no violence in keeping with what some [[Gender HCI]] studies have suggested appeals more to female audiences.]]

The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater [[gender studies]], and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male-dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games.

In 2008, an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media.&lt;ref&gt;Olson CK, Kutner LA, Warner DE, Almerigi JB, Baer L, Nicholi AM Jr, &amp; Beresin EV: ''Factors correlated with violent video game use by adolescent boys and girls''. Journal of Adolescent Health, 2007, 41: 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were released in the book, ''[[Grand Theft Childhood]]'', wherein it was found that among girls, nine of the "top ten [most popular video games] were nonviolent games such as ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' titles, ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' or [[Game (simulation)|simulation game]]s" compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys.&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the conclusion reached in ''Grand Theft Childhood'' was that "focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents, social activists and public-policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established, including a range of [non-gender-linked] social, behavioral, economic, biological and mental-health factors."&lt;ref&gt;Kutner, Lawrence, Ph.D. and Olson, Cheryl K., Sc.D. ''[[Grand Theft Childhood|Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. 15 April 2008. {{ISBN|0-7432-9951-5}}. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion supports [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[David Satcher|Satcher]]'s 2001 study (''supra'').&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

Despite this conclusion, general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non-violent video games specifically for [[girl gamer|female audiences]]. Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non-violent video game genres such as [[life simulation game]]s, [[strategy game]]s, or [[puzzle video game]]s. Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence, they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the [[first-person shooter]] genre.

==Religious perspective==
Criticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti-violence groups, and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups. The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general. In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression, wrath, and anger. Violent video games, while merely vicarious in nature, have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles.&lt;ref name=nash/&gt; Notable anti-violent-video-game crusader, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] is a self proclaimed [[Christian right|Christian conservative]],&lt;ref name=provenzo/&gt; and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views. As groups like the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] population have increased in number of adherents, new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Matthew. ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4534835.stm Christians purge video game demons]''. BBC News – Washington. 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several religion-centric games forums such as [[GameSpot]]'s [[GameSpot#Forums|"Religion and Philosophy" forum]] have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gamespot.com/pages/unions/forums/show_topics.php?board_id=909179086&amp;union_id=7382 Religion and Philosophy]''.

===Christian games===
{{Main article|Christian video game}}
There has been a rapid increase in [[Christian video game]]s in the last decade,&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors, there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non-Christian values.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, Jonathan. ''[http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/5/29/195855/959 The Purpose Driven Life Takers (Part 1)]''. Talk to Action. 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Thompson, for instance, has publicly decried such Christian games as ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', stating "It's absurd, ... you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels, and if that doesn't hit your hot button, you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;Chmielewski, Dawn C. ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/10/business/fi-godgames10/2 Converting Video Games Into Instruments of God]'' LA Times. 10 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The game reviewers [[IGN]], [[Ars Technica]] and [[GameSpy]] have disagreed that "Left Behind: Eternal Forces" is overtly violent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/articles/745/745956p1.html IGN: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2006/12/leftbehind.ars Ars Technica: Left Behind: Eternal Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/left-behind-eternal-forces/749748p1.html GameSpy: Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review]&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, James Dobson, PhD., founder of the [[Focus on the Family]] group, has advised parents in relation to video games to "avoid the violent ones altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James. Dr. ''[http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/index.html?uc_full_date=20041010 Teen's Hard Times Can Help Build Character]''. 10 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Super 3D Noah's Ark.png|frame|In the [[Christian video game]], ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]'', the player takes the role of [[Noah]] as he non-violently shoots food with a slingshot in order to sate hordes of ravening animals.]]
Although Christian games have been around since [[Sparrow Records]]' ''[[Music Machine (album series)#Spin-offs|Music Machine]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]], there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS). The majority of games that have been [[List of banned video games|banned]] for violence have been FPS games, and for this reason, Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre. Games such as ''[[Revelation 7 (video game)|Revelation 7]]'' and ''[[Xibalba (video game)|Xibalba]]'', for instance, have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using "off the wall" [[absurdism|absurdist]] humor with enemies such as flying, bat-winged clown heads (modeled after the biblical [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]) that shoot rays out of their nose, or alien Nazis (a mocking reference to [[Raëlism|Raëlian]] religious beliefs)&lt;ref name=linder&gt;Linder, Matthew. ''Marty Bee Interview''. Gamepraise.net (also available at Objectiveministries.org). 1 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian FPS games such as ''[[Eternal War]]'' have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twoguyssoftware.ca/ Xrucifix]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these games, despite containing objectively violent content, have been affirmatively labeled "non-violent video games" by marketers and faith-based non-violent gaming communities. In direct response to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] (alleged to have been caused by the shooters' obsession with the game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''), Rev. Ralph Bagley began production on ''[[Catechumen (video game)|Catechumen]]'', a Christian first-person game produced by N'Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Jonathan. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01GAMES.html PlayStations of the Cross]''. New York Times. 1 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Catechumen'', the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament. When "sent back" the demons produce no blood or gore, and for this reason it has been described as a non-violent game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/disneys-atlantis-the-lost-empire Metacritic Game Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of ''Catechumen'', according to Rev. Bagley, is "to build the genre of Christian gaming. People are tired of having these violent, demonic games dictating to their kids."&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Among Christian FPS games, a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non-violence. Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non-Christian games such as ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' as comparatively non-violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus.

An example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation, focusing on [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]] gameplay and Biblical principles. Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is [[Wisdom Tree]] which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

===Hindu games===
In 2006, Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first-person shooter entitled ''My Hindu Shooter'' was in the works.&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Allen. ''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_66/385-My-Hindu-Shooter My Hindu Shooter]''. 10 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''My Hindu Shooter'', a game based on the [[Unreal Engine]], the player employs the [[Vedas|Vedic]] abilities of [[Jyotiṣa|astrology]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic healing]], breathing (meditation), [[herbalism]], [[Gandharva Kingdom#Gandharva Chitrasena|Gandharva Veda music]], architecture (which let you purify demonic areas) and [[Yajna|yagyas]] (rituals). Gameplay involved acquisition of the [[siddhi]]s of clairvoyance, levitation, invisibility, shrinking and strength, and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing [[karma]] through completion of quests and cleansing the six [[chakra]]s in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Kietzmann, Ludwig. ''[http://www.joystiq.com/2006/10/19/buy-incomplete-game-on-ebay-finish-it-yourself Buy incomplete game on eBay, finish it yourself]''. 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gaygamer.net/2006/10/my_hindu_shooter.html My Hindu Shooter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919105128/http://gaygamer.net/2006/10/my_hindu_shooter.html |date=19 September 2009 }}'' Gaygamer.com review. 15 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to actually win the game is to complete it without harming or killing any other living creature.

''[http://www.allenvarney.com/ Allen Varney Writer Game Designer]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varney, Allen ''[http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com/user/Allen%20Varney My Escapist Articles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020090750/http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com/user/Allen%20Varney |date=20 October 2008 }}''.

===Buddhist games===
According to Buddhist morality, the first of the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Śīla]] is a personal rule of not killing. This moral guideline extends to human as well as non-human life. 
There are five conditions to violate the first precept:
# The being must be alive. 
# There must be the knowledge that it is a sentient living being. 
# There must be an intention to cause death. 
# An act must be done to cause death. 
# There must be death, as the result of the said act.

{{Original research|section|date=July 2014}}As the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated, Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt. The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all. The main problem is the mind, which is the main focus of Buddhism. Violent video games tend to create ill-will and tension, thus it is not conducive for meditation practice. Other than that, the action of the mind also creates ''kamma'' (action) which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right.

Although primarily [[browser game]]s, a number of stand-alone video games eschewing violence, such as the 2007 Thai game ''Ethics Game'' have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally.&lt;ref&gt;Sherriff, Lucy.

''[[The Register]]''. 13 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist concept of [[dharma]] has been emphasized in a number of Buddhist games as a reaction to perceptions of the [[Adharma|adharmic]] state of modern games.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dharmagames.org/ Dharma Games]''. Retrieved 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[zen]] has also influenced a number of nonviolent video games such as ''[[Zen of Sudoku]]'', and [[The Game Factory#Nintendo DS|The Game Factory]]'s ''[[Zenses]]'' series.

===Jewish games===

[attempt] to get over any barrier or road block implanted by Israeli Defense forces without using violence, [and] earn respect by helping surrounded people whom {{sic}} can't get through the separation walls."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.afkarmedia.com/index.php?PageTitle=Road%20Block%20Buster&amp;Type=games&amp;Status=Details&amp;ID=8 Road Block Buster]''.

===Bahá'í games===
In January 2007, artist Chris Nelson produced a non-violent [[art game]] called ''The Seven Valleys'' which he exhibited during the ACSW conference at the [[University of Ballarat]]. Based on the ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' engine, ''The Seven Valleys'' was designed with the intention of "illustrat[ing] the unillustratable, and 'subvert[ing]' the image of violent video games in the process."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://pizza.sandwich.net/2007/02/bahai-video-games-but-do-they-pwn.shtml Baha’i video games: but do they pwn?]''.

===Religion neutral games===
Non-profit organization [http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/ Heartseed] set out to produce several non-violent games, drawing inspiration from a claimed agreement between several religions under the sign of nonviolence: "Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and others, – because throughout all of them can be found a common thread of  decency meant to propel us toward spiritual enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://heartseed.sourceforge.net/about.php Heartseed's About Page ]''&lt;/ref&gt; This project seems to have been discontinued.

==Types of non-violent video games==
Non-violent video games as a genre are characterized as a [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|genre by purpose]]. Unlike genres described by style of gameplay, non-violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres. Defined in the negative, the purpose of non-violent games is to provide the player with an experience that ''lacks'' violence. Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term "non-violent video games" to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy. For game developers and designers who self-identify as non-violent video game makers, however, the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non-violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as [[action game]]s, [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]], [[strategy game]]s, and the [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

[[Video game genres#Other notable genres|Emergent and more recent gameplay genres]] such as [[music video game]]s are for the most part naturally non-violent. [[Video game genres#Video game genres by purpose|Purposive video game genres]] such as [[educational game]]s also are primarily non-violent in nature. Other electronic game genres like [[audio game]]s are also most frequently non-violent. The indisputably non-violent nature of these games are often considered self-evident by members of both the non-violent gaming community and the gaming community at large. As such they are often not explicitly identified as such. Typically, explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non-violence. This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust, hostility, and mockery&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Seth. ''[http://www.cracked.com/article_15672_praystation-6-most-misguided-christian-video-games.html PrayStation: The 6 Most Misguided Christian Video]''. [[Cracked.com]]. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre.

===Traditionally non-violent games===
[[File:KMines.png|thumb|Games like ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]'' contain traditionally non-violent [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] aspects, though minesweeper takes its name from a facet of war.]]
Among traditionally non-violent games are included [[List of maze video games|maze games]], [[adventure game]]s, [[life simulation game]]s, [[construction and management simulation]] games, and some [[vehicle simulation game]]s among others. These games are generally less frequently described as non-violent due to the self-evident nature of the descriptive term. Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non-violence, non-violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non-violent genres, however a number of games even under the traditionally non-violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent. ''[[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]]'', for instance, is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result.

Other common traditionally non-violent genres include [[adventure game]]s, [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]]s, [[music video game]]s, [[programming game]]s, [[Party video game|party games]], and traditional games.

Examples of traditionally non-violent games include:
*''[[Sudoku Gridmaster]]'' – A totally non-violent game wherein the player must assign the mathematically appropriate number to the corresponding blank in a grid.
*''[[Roller Coaster (video game)|Roller Coaster]]'' – A game featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must navigate a dangerous amusement park to collect pieces of money.
*''[[Alleyway (video game)|Alleyway]]'' – A game with only environmental hazards featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must break blocks (mild violence) with a ball while avoiding the floor of the level.
*The ''[[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]]'' series – A series with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player must solve block-sliding puzzles in order to secure a key and unlock the door to the next room.
*''[[Robots (1984 video game)|Robots]]'' – A game lacking violence to sentient beings wherein a player must either bomb malfunctioning robots or conserve bombs by stepping strategically in order to induce the robots to crash into one another.

===Non-violent action games===
[[File:Seiklus.jpg|thumb|''[[Seiklus]]'' is a [[platform game|platformer]] that lacks much of the violence traditionally associated with platformers.]]
Action games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player-character, and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them. As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences. Nevertheless, some companies like [[Nintendo]] have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence, a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by [[media violence research]]ers. This has created a spectrum of violence in action games. Non-violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low-level violence as non-violent as well as games such as the anti-violent [[serious game]], ''[[Food Force]]''.

Studies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately. This has led to support for the development of action games that are non-violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Mark.

====Non-violent first person shooters====
The application of the term "non-violent" to genres such as the [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), that many players consider ''inherently'' or ''definitionally'' violent, has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic. This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as "extreme, destructive, or uncontrollable force especially of natural events; intensity of feeling or expression,&lt;ref&gt;''violence''. Encarta. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; " a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent. Despite arguments to the contrary, however, such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non-violent video games, and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre.

Non-violent first-person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non-violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt; Rarely, FPS games such as ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' that have been developed without the specific intent of non-violence have been identified by reviewers and the non-violent gaming community as non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;Au, Wagner James. ''[http://gigaom.com/2008/01/31/does-portals-success-presage-game-industry-shift Does Portal’s Success Presage Game Industry Shift?]''.

''[http://www.alibi.com/index.php?story=23364&amp;scn=feature Emerge Remerge Demerge]''. Feature Archive. V.17 No.21. 22–28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games, not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths. Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first-person ''shooter'', as in certain games such as ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'', the player doesn't shoot anything at all, but merely clicks walls with the cursor. Similarly, in games such as ''[[Myst#Remakes and rereleases|realMyst]]'', the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first-person and the term "shooter" is seen to be objectively inaccurate. Despite this, non-violent first-person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres, these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre.

Often modeled upon violent FPS games, non-violent FPSes such as ''[[Chex Quest]]'' or the newer Sherlock Holmes games, may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using. Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe "zorching", "slobbing", or otherwise non-lethally incapacitating enemies. Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non-violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to become the green shroud from the slime-sequence in ''Chex Quest'' or the removal of the red shroud from the death-sequence in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the deaths in ''Portal''. At times, similarities between violent progenitors and their non-violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non-violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version. This is apparent in ''Chex Quest''. Off-beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non-violent FPSes.&lt;ref name=linder/&gt;

One subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non-violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle, is that of [[stealth game]]s. Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non-violent genre, stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} When stealth and violence are both present as options, stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill.&lt;ref name="kotakuDishonoredParty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/dishonoreds-party-level-rewrote-the-rules-of-stealth-ga-1613011624|last=Burford|first=GB|work=Kotaku|title=Dishonored's Party Level Rewrote The Rules Of Stealth Games|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-violent role-playing games===
[[File:Spritual warfare.PNG|frame|The [[Christian video game|Christian RPG]], ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', features a non-violent hero who spreads repentance by sharing holy fruit]]
Though infrequently regarded as explicitly violent, role-playing video games (RPGs) have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling-up to fight greater and greater foes. Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn-based, however the actions of the player-characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent. There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series{{Citation needed|date = July 2009}} or by recasting the enemies' deaths as "fainting," "sleeping," or becoming "stunned" as in the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series, however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non-violent.

One rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non-violent video game is ''[[Spiritual Warfare (video game)|Spiritual Warfare]]'', a game with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food. Another example is ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]'', an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] based on economic development.

Secular examples include Capcom's ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Shawn. ''Capcom's Ace Attorney Video Game''. 24 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savino, Candace. ''[http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/28/ds-fanboy-review-apollo-justice-ace-attorney DS Fanboy Review: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]''. 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Interactive Software|Victor]]'s ''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nowar-paix.ca/goodvideogames/index.html Recommended Nonviolent Video Games]''. NoWar list.&lt;/ref&gt; – a simulation/RPG game. Additionally, such RPGs as  ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non-violent. This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' series]].

In 2015 the fan-funded indie RPG ''[[Undertale]]'' allowed players to choose whether or not to use violent methods, in a story that includes both explicit and subtextual commentary on the nature of violence in videogames.

===Non-violent strategy games===
As with role-playing games, strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies. Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent, however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles, wars, and other skirmishes. Additionally, strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result. Counteracting this violence, however, is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized.

For the most part, non-violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game. Gender-marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences, however gender-linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such, male- and female-oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence. Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'' in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock-and-roll music and general secularism. The game has been criticized by such anti-violent video game personalities as former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]]&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non-believers, and for the ability of players engaged in multi-play modes to play as the Antichrist on the side of the Forces of Satan.

Secular non-violent video game designers have emerged from the [[serious game]]s movement and include such anti-violence titles as ''[[PeaceMaker (computer game)|PeaceMaker]]'', a game where the player tries to foster peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and ''[[A Force More Powerful]]'', a nonviolence-themed game designed by [[Steve York]], a documentary filmmaker  and director of Bringing Down a Dictator, a non violent resistance film featuring Ivan Marovic, a resistance leader against [[Slobodan Milošević]] who was instrumental in bringing him down in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Troeh, Eve. ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5342543 Video Game Teaches Non-Violent Solutions]''. [[National Public Radio]]. 14 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks. ''[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/may/08/seriousgamere Serious game: resolving conflict with non-violent means]''. The Guardian. 8 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though these games are anti-violent, however, failure on the part of the player leads to violence. Thus the goal of the game is merely shifted to active violence-prevention while the degree of violence used to challenge the player remains consistent with violent strategy games.

Some examples of relatively nonviolent strategy games include:

===Non-violent sports games and non-violent vehicle simulations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
According to the Funk and Buchman method for [[Game classification#Electronic games|classifying video games]], there are six categories into which games may be divided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children, Adolescents and the Media|author=[[Victor C. Strasburger]] and Barbara J. Wilson|pages=122–123|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-2125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#general entertainment (no fighting or destruction)
#educational (learning or problem solving)
#fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal)
#human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters)
#nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction)
#sports violence (fighting or destruction involved)

The separation of violent and nonviolent sports here illustrates a phenomenon also recognizable in the [[vehicle simulation game]] genre. With both sport and vehicle simulation games, gameplay has traditionally been highly bipolar with nearly as many violent titles as non-violent. Just as there are non-violent and ''violent'' sports games, so too are there [[flight simulator|flight]] and [[combat flight simulator|''combat'' flight simulators]], [[Space simulator|space flight]] and [[Space flight simulator game|space ''combat'' simulators]], and [[Racing video game|racing game]]s and [[vehicular combat game|vehicular ''combat'' games]]. Distinction of games as violent or non-violent here serves a purely practical purpose as gameplay may differ considerably beyond the merely aesthetic.

Such sports as [[Table tennis|Ping-pong]], [[golf]], and [[Cue sports|billiards]], have in the past been identified as nonviolent.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, Martin. ''[http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/37171/Twisted_List_Top_Nonviolent_Sports_Games.html Twisted List: Top Nonviolent Sports Games]''. G4TV TechTV Vault. 16 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of a nonviolent game that has been employed in a number of studies and government committee reports is ''[[NBA Jam: Tournament Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh, S. J. (1998). ''Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias''. Childhood, 5 (2), 177–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Joanne. ''[https://www.webcitation.org/5s52ruFm4?url=http://yourmindonmedia.com/downloads/media_violence_paper.pdf The Psychological Effects of Media Violence on Children and Adolescents]''. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsh.

[[File:Numerosityadaptation.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|alt=Two figures, one above the other. First figure (up) display contain two circles: 10 dots in the circle at left and 100 dots in the circle at right. Fixation mark is placed between two circles. The second figure display contain two circles with each of them contain 40 dots. The dots in the left circle are arranged as mirror image of the dots in the right circle|An example of the numerosity adaptation effect]]
The '''numerosity adaptation effect''' is a [[perception|perceptual phenomenon]] in [[numerical cognition]] which demonstrates non-symbolic [[number sense|numerical intuition]] and exemplifies how numerical percepts can impose themselves upon the human brain automatically. This effect was first described in 2008.&lt;ref name=Dehaene&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origins of Mathematical Intuitions The Case of Arithmetic |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=2009 |first=Stanislas |last=Dehaene |authorlink=Stanislas Dehaene |volume=1156 |issue= |pages=232–259 |pmid=19338511 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04469.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Visual Sense of Number |journal=Current Biology |date=2008 |first=David |last=Burr |author2=John Ross  |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=425–428 |pmid=18342507 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.052 |url=http://www.pisavisionlab.org/teaching/burr/CB_number.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, this effect is described only for controlled experimental conditions. In the illustration, a viewer should have a strong impression that the left display (lower figure) is more numerous than the right, after 30 seconds of viewing the adaptation (upper figure), although both have exactly the same number of dots. The viewer might also underestimate the number of dots presented in the display.&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

Both effects are resistant to manipulation of the non-numerical parameters of the display. Thus, this effect cannot be simply explained in terms of size, density, or contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calibrating the mental number line |journal=Cognition |date=2008 |first=Véronique |last=Izard |author2=Stanislas Dehaene  |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=1221–1247 |pmid=17678639 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.06.004 |url=http://www.google.co.il/search?hl=iw&amp;q=%22Calibrating+the+mental+number+line%22&amp;btnG=%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross2/&gt;

Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of these effects is that they happen immediately, and without conscious control (i.e., knowing that the numbers are equal would not hamper their happening).&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt; This points to the operation of a special and largely automatic processing system. As noted by Burr &amp; Ross (2008):

{{cquote|''Just as we have a direct visual sense of the reddishness of half a dozen ripe cherries, so we do of their sixishness.''&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross/&gt;}}

==Possible explanations==
Few explanations were suggested to explain these phenomena. It was argued that they are heavily dependent on density and less on numerosity. Also, it was suggested that numerosity may be correlated with [[kurtosis]] and that the results may be better explained in terms of texture density such that only dots falling within the spatial region where the test is displayed effectively adapt the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texture density adaptation and visual number revisited |journal=Current Biology |date=September 23, 2008 |first=Frank H |last=Durgin |volume=18 |issue=18 |pages=R855–R856 |pmid=18812077 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.053 |url=http://download.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/PIIS0960982208009627.pdf?intermediate=true |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the display in the original experiments was of spots uniformly either white or black, the kurtosis account is inapplicable. The texture density explanation doesn't seem to disentangle the complexity of these phenomena as in the display the left field adapts to many dots, the right field to few, and these adapters selectively affect the relevant test stimuli. It is not the number of dots in the entire display that causes the adaptation but only those within a particular area.&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Response: Visual number |journal=Current Biology |date=September 23, 2008 |first=David |last=Burr |author2=John Ross  |volume=18 |issue=18 |pages=R857–R858 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.052 |url=http://www.unifi.it/off_form/allegati/uploaded_files/2008/200049/0567621/Numerosity_ReplytoDurgin_DISCUSSION.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, why adaptation have such profound effect on numerosity estimates remains largely unexplained.&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

==History==

===Ryad===

According to Old Russian chronicles, in 862, [[East Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Baltic Finns|Finns]] invited Varangians under the leadership of prince [[Rurik]] to rule in their land:

{{quote|They said to themselves, "Let us seek a prince ''who may rule over us and judge us according to the Law''." They accordingly went overseas to the [[Rus' people|Varangian Russes]]: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans, English, and Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The [[Chud]]s, the Slavs, the [[Krivichs|Krivichians]], and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. ''Come to rule and reign over us''."|''The Laurentian Text of [[Primary Chronicle]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|author=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor2=Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor|title=The Russian Primary chronicle: Laurentian text|url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf|year=1953|publisher=[[Medieval Academy of America]]|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Russian state settled on the oral treaty, or "'''ryad'''" (Old Russian: рядъ) between the prince ([[knyaz]]) with his armed force ([[druzhina]]) on the one hand, and tribal "nobility" and formally all people on the other hand. The prince and his druzhina defended people, decide lawsuits, provided trade and built towns. And people paid [[tribute]] and took part in [[irregular military]]. During the ensuing centuries the ''ryad'' was playing an important role in Old Russian princedoms: the prince and his administration (druzhina) found their relationship with people ("all land", "all townsmen" in Old Russian chronicles) on the treaty. A breach of the treaty could result in exile of the prince ([[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav Yaroslavich]] and [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod Yaroslavich]]) or even in murder of the prince ([[Igor of Kiev|Igor Rurikovich]] and [[Igor II of Kiev|Igor Olgovich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melnikova, Elena.

One of the result of [[Rus'–Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'–Byzantine War]]s was conclusion of [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Treaties with Byzantine]] in the 10th century, where, apart from Byzantine legal rules, also Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') - rules of Old Russian oral [[Custom (law)|customary law]] reflected.

[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s Pravda of the beginning of the 11th century was the first written law in Rus'. This short [[Code (law)|code]] regulated the relationship between the princely druzhina ("rusins") and the people ("slovenins") concerning [[criminal law]]. After Yaroslav's death, his sons [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav]], [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]], [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] and their druzhina got together and promulgated a code concerning the violation of property rights in princely lands (Pravda of Yaroslav's sons) in the middle of the 11th century. Yaroslav's Pravda and Pravda of Yaroslav's sons became a basis for the Short edition of Russkaya Pravda.

In the period of [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'s reign at the beginning of the 12th century, the Vast edition of Russkaya Pravda was given, which contained rules of criminal, [[Procedural law|procedural]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] law, including trade, [[Family law|family]] law and rules of the bond of obligation.

Later written secular law also included statutory charters, trade treaties, statutes of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], big codes of Moscow Rus' - Sudebniks (see below), and other texts.

===[[Byzantine law]] and church law===
Translations of Byzantine legal codes, including [[Nomocanon]], were widely spread in Old Rus' (see: [[Kormchaia]], [[Merilo Pravednoye]]),&lt;ref&gt;Schapov, Yaroslav. ''Byzantine and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Legal Heritage in Rus' at 11-13th centuries'' / ed. by Lev Cherepnin. - Moscow: [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]], 1978. – 290 p. ({{lang-ru|Щапов Я.Н. Византийское и южнославянское правовое наследие на Руси в XI–XIII вв. / отв. ред. Л.В. Черепнин. – М.: Наука, 1978. – 290 с.}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't widely applied in secular or church legal practice, restricted mainly in [[canon law]]. The Church in Old Rus' did not have wide influence and depended on the power of the state. Thus, church law mainly dealt with family law and sanctions against moral violation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Zhivov|Zhivov, Viktor]]. ''The History of Russian Law as a Linguistic and [[Semiotics|Semiotic]] Problem'' // Zhivov, Viktor. Investigations in the Field of History and Prehistory of Russian Culture. - Moscow: Yazyki Slavyanskoy Kultury ("Languages of Slavic culture"), 2002. – P. 187–305. ({{lang-ru|Живов В.М.

In the [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 2018|first August 2018 spill]] he challenged Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] for leadership of the Liberal Party, but was defeated by 48 votes to 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/21/liberal-leadership-dutton-turnbull-energy|title=More ministers offer to resign in wake of failed challenge to Turnbull – as it happened|first=Amy|last=Remeikis|date=21 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the spill Dutton resigned from [[Second Turnbull Ministry]] and rejected an invitation from Turnbull to remain in the Cabinet. In the second leadership contest, Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister [[Scott Morrison]] by 45 votes to 40. Following the appointment of [[Scott Morrison]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] on 24 August by the Governor-General, Morrison re-appointed Peter Dutton to the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]], but relinquished his duties and responsibilities for Immigration and Border Protection, and appointed [[David Coleman (Australian politician)|David Coleman]] as [[Immigration Minister]].

==Early years==
Dutton was born in the northern [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Boondall]], the eldest of five children, with one brother and three sisters. His mother Ailsa Leitch worked in childcare and his father Bruce Dutton was a builder. Dutton finished high school at the Anglican [[St Paul's Anglican School, Bald Hills|St Paul's School, Bald Hills]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dutton joined the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] in 1988. He became the policy vice-chair of the Bayside Young Liberals the following year and chair of the branch in 1990. At the [[Queensland state election, 1989|1989 Queensland state election]], Dutton ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate against [[Tom Burns (Australian politician)|Tom Burns]] in the safe [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] seat of [[Electoral district of Lytton|Lytton]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterdutton.com.au/MeetPeter/MaidenSpeech.aspx|title=Peter Dutton MP - Federal Member for Dickson &gt; Meet Peter &gt; Maiden Speech|last=Dickson|first=Peter Dutton MP - Federal Member for|website=www.peterdutton.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton graduated from the Queensland Police Academy in 1990. He was a [[Queensland Police]] officer for nine years, working in the Drug Squad in Brisbane in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdutton.com.au/MeetPeter/AboutPeter.aspx|title=About Peter Dutton|work=PetterDutton.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/guide/dick/|title=Dickson|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=ABC Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in the Sex Offenders Squad and the [[National Crime Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://player.whooshkaa.com/shows/sky-news-the-bolt-report|title=Sky News - The Bolt Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Whooshkaa|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second job, he worked with his father in a building business.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999, Dutton left the police force to become a businessman, completing a [[Bachelor of Business]] at the [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=00AKI|title=The Hon Peter Dutton MP|publisher=[[Australian Parliament House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/to-some-hes-the-messiah-to-others-a-duplicitous-polly-20091006-glh1.html|title=To some he's the messiah, to others a duplicitous polly|author=Misha Schubert|date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his father founded the business Dutton Holdings, which was registered in 2000; it operated under six different trading and business names.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abr.business.gov.au/|title=ABN Lookup|last=|first=|date=2014-11-01|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815074306/http://abr.business.gov.au/|archive-date=2000-08-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought, renovated, and converted buildings into childcare centres, and in 2002 sold three childcare centres to the now defunct [[ABC Learning]]. ABC Learning continued to pay rent to Dutton Holdings for a commercial lease until at least 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/questions-over-childcare/news-story/b69b90f9fd6fc9ac51eef428de68978f|title=Questions over childcare|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton Holdings continues to trade under the name Dutton Building &amp; Development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Howard Government (2001–07)==
Dutton was elected to the [[Division of Dickson]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]], defeating Labor's [[Cheryl Kernot]]. He was elevated to the ministry after the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] as [[Minister for Employment Participation (Australia)|Minister for Workforce Participation]], a position he held until January 2006. He was then appointed [[Assistant Treasurer of Australia|Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue]]. He successfully retained Dickson at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], which saw the government lose office. However, his margin was reduced to just 217 votes more than Labor's Fiona McNamara.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/dickson.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Dickson|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition (2007–13)==
Following the 2007 election, Dutton was promoted to [[Shadow Cabinet of Australia|shadow cabinet]] by the new Liberal leader [[Brendan Nelson]], as Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_6dec07-22sep08.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he chose not to be present in the chamber during the apology to the [[Stolen Generations]], which enjoyed bipartisan support.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; He said "I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Morning Herald]], Dutton said he regretted boycotting the apology: "I underestimated the symbolic and cultural significance of it."&lt;ref
name=":2" /&gt;

In September 2008, Nelson was replaced as Liberal leader by [[Malcolm Turnbull]], who appointed Dutton as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing. He retained that position when [[Tony Abbott]] succeeded Turnbull as leader in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turnbull Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_22sep2008-23jan2009.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Dutton released the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]'s mental health policy. It received favourable reviews, with ''[[The Australian]]'' describing it as "the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence-based investment in mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cresswell|first1=Adam|title=Experts hail a policy 'game-changer'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/experts-hail-a-policy-game-changer/story-e6frg6n6-1225886440963|agency=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton retained his seat with a positive swing at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], despite an unfavourable redistribution. In the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], he announced a range of Coalition health policies, which were received favourably by industry groups. The [[Australian Medical Association]] said "the Coalition has delivered a strong package of practical, affordable health policies that would strengthen general practice",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition has been listening on health policy|url=https://ama.com.au/media/coalition-has-been-listening-health-policy|website=AMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cancer Council Australia]] said that "Dutton’s promise to finalise the bowel cancer screening program by 2020 would save an additional 35,000 lives over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Health Minister Peter Dutton set to save 35,000 Australian lives, says Cancer Council|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/news/media-releases/new-health-minister-peter-dutton-set-to-save-35000-australian-lives-says-cancer-council.html|website=Cancer Council Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted seat shift===
As the 2010 election approached, it looked like Dutton would lose to the Labor candidate due to a redistribution of division boundaries that had erased his majority and made Dickson notionally Labor. To safeguard himself, Dutton sought pre-selection for the merged [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] in the safe Liberal seat of [[Division of McPherson|McPherson]] on the Gold Coast (despite not living in or near McPherson).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/doorknocking-dutton-has-work-cut-out-20091020-h75g.html|title=Door-knocking Dutton has work cut out|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|date=2009-10-22|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some constituents complained, "The abandoning of a seat by a sitting MP halfway through a parliamentary term to contest pre-selection in a seat over 100 kilometres to the south is not looked upon favourably."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2009/09/23/constituents-not-happy-about-dutton-dumping-dickson/|title=Constituents not happy about Dutton dumping Dickson|date=2009-09-23|website=Crikey|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton lost the McPherson pre-selection to [[Karen Andrews]], reportedly due to misgivings from former Nationals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/fed2016/dickson/ Federal Election 2016: Dickson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He then asked the LNP to "deliver him a seat for which he doesn't have to fight other preselection candidates." Liberal MP [[Alex Somlyay]] (the chief Opposition whip of the time) said that Dutton's expectation of an uncontested preselection was "unusual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dutton-seeks-seat-without-a-struggle-20091006-glh0.html|title=Dutton seeks seat without a struggle|last=Grattan|first=Michelle|date=2009-10-07|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the state executive didn't provide Dutton an unchallenged preselection, Dutton reluctantly returned to campaign for the seat of Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-20/dutton-to-fight-for-dickson/1111186|title=Dutton to fight for Dickson|date=2009-10-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dickson Decides|date=2009-10-23|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-23/dickson-decides/1115388|language=en-AU|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet minister (2013–present)==
{{see also|Abbott Government|Turnbull Government}}

=== Minister for Health ===

Dutton retained his seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]]. He was appointed to the [[Abbott Ministry|Ministry]] by then Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], and served as [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]].

As Health Minister, Dutton announced the world-leading $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. As announced, the capital and any ongoing capital gains of the Medical Research Future Fund will be preserved in perpetuity.

Under Minister Dutton, projected funding in the health portfolio increased in the 2014-15 Budget to $66.9 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent from $62.2 billion in 2012-13, the final full year of the Labor Government. Projected expenditure on Medicare increased over 9.5 percent from $18.5 billion in 2012-13 under Labor to a projected $20.32 billion in 2014-15 under Dutton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2014-15|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/bp1/download/BP1_combined.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2013-14|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/bp1/html/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for public hospital services increased by nearly 14 percent under Dutton in the 2014-15 Budget to a projected $15.12 billion compared to $13.28 billion in the last full year of the Labor Government in 2012-13.

In a 2015 poll by ''Australian Doctor'' magazine, Dutton was voted the worst health minister in the last 35 years by 46 percent of respondents. However, only 1,100 out of the magazine's 20,000 readers voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Dutton ranked as worst health minister in 35 years in poll of doctors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/12/peter-dutton-ranked-as-worst-health-minister-in-35-years-in-poll-of-doctors|website=Guardian Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sarah Hanson-Young ====

On 5 June 2015, Dutton denied claims made by [[Australian Greens|Greens]] Senator [[Sarah Hanson-Young]] that she was spied on
during a visit to Nauru. At the same time he called into question her
credibility saying "she's written to me on some issues which are completely fanciful when you have a look at the facts and she's got a track record of making these things up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hanson-Young responded that "Peter Dutton can attack and insult me as
much as he likes, but nothing will change the fact that my work has
revealed systemic child abuse and the rape of young women on Nauru
under his watch."&lt;ref name="hanson_young" /&gt; The spying claims
were later confirmed by the Immigration Department and [[Wilson Security]] who carried out the spying operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Au pair cases====
In June 2015, an [[au pair]] who was detained at Brisbane Airport made a phone call and had her tourist visa reinstated.  In November, in a second case, Dutton granted a visa to another au pair, despite his department warning him that she was at risk of breaching her work conditions on her tourist visa.  Dutton indicated that he knew neither tourist.  In August 2018, [[Roman Quaedvlieg]] indicated that he had personal knowledge of one of the cases, and was seeking to correct Hansard if it did not match his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Lisa |title=Former border force head 'has knowledge' of Dutton's au pair visa decision |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/22/former-border-force-head-roman-quaedvlieg-has-knowledge-of-duttons-au-pair-visa-decision |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=22 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third au pair was granted a visa due to lobbying by AFL chief [[Gillon McLachlan]], she was due to stay with his relative Callum Maclachlan.

==== Rising seas joke ====

On 11 September 2015, Dutton was overheard on an [[microphone gaffe|open microphone]], prior to a community meeting on Syrian
refugees, joking about rising sea levels in the Pacific Islands. He said "time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Manus Island ====
On 15 April 2017 shots were fired by the Papua New Guinea defence force into the [[Manus Regional Processing Centre|Manus Island Detention Centre]]. Dutton responded saying "There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five year old boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like, within the local PNG community." "I think there was concern about why the boy was being led or for what purpose he was being led away back into the regional processing centre. So I think it's fair to say that the mood had elevated quite quickly. I think some of the local residents were quite angry about this particular incident and another alleged sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

an outrageous lie. "This has disturbing echoes of the

On 31 October 2017, the Papuan Government closed down the Manus Island regional processing centre. However, 600 men residing in the processing centre refused to be moved to alternative accommodation in the town of [[Lorengau]] and staged a protest. Dutton defended the closure of the processing centre and asserted that the Papuan authorities had given notice of the camp's impending closure in May 2017. He also rejected [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Nick McKim]]'s report that there was no safe alternative accommodation available as false and claimed McKim was inciting trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Liam |title=Manus Island detention centre to permanently close today, 600 men refusing to leave |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-31/manus-island-detention-centre-to-close-at-5pm-today/9102768 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a prolonged standoff with Papuan security forces, the remaining men were evacuated, many forcibly, to new accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baxendale|first1=Rachel |title=Manus Island: last of asylum seekers removed from detention centre |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/pm-blames-kevin-rudd-for-manus-asylum-seeker-standoff/news-story/50c63065e489390b6f38bec8a8588294|accessdate=30 November 2017 |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrangements have been made to resettle an unspecified number of the asylum seekers in the United States.

In mid November 2017, Dutton rejected an offer by the newly-elected [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] to resettle 150 asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre in New Zealand and warned that it would have repercussions for the two countries' bilateral relations. He also claimed that New Zealand's offer would encourage people smugglers. Dutton also criticised a New Zealand offer to provide $3 million for services for asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru as a "waste of money" that could be spend elsewhere, such as displaced people in Indonesia. In addition, Dutton criticised Australia's [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Bill Shorten]]'s call for Australia to accept the New Zealand offer as an attempt to appease the [[Labor Left]] with "cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belot |first1=Henry |title=Malcolm Turnbull not accepting Jacinda Ardern's offer to resettle asylum seekers in NZ 'at this time' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-05/turnbull-wont-accept-nz-offer-to-resettle-refugees-at-this-time/9120028 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carp |first1=Paul |last2=Roy |first2=Eleanor Ainge |title=New Zealand seeks deal with Australia to resettle Manus and Nauru refugees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/new-zealand-and-png-could-do-deal-on-refugees-peter-dutton-says |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immigration from New Zealand ====
As both Immigration Minister and Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has defended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 that facilitates the denial or  cancellation of Australian visas for non-citizens on "character" grounds. This stringent "character test" also affects non-citizens who have lived most of their lives in Australia or who have families living in the country.&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ma1958118|Migration Act 1958|501}} Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand nationals living in Australia were disproportionately affected by this "character test" with over 1,300 New Zealanders having been deported from Australia in the period between January 2015 and July 2018.&lt;ref name="ABC Don't call Australia Home"&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't Call Australia Home! |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/don%E2%80%99t-call-australia-home!/10005152 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT NZ fury"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Regan |first1=Slyvia Varnham |title=Why New Zealand Is Furious About Australia’s Deportation Policy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/new-zealand-australia-deportations.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs Department]] report, 620 New Zealanders had their visas cancelled on character grounds in 2017 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key visa cancellation statistics |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/reports-publications/research-statistics/statistics/key-cancellation-statistics |publisher=[[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]] |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Dutton's [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] introduced a special Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa to provide a pathway for New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa to acquire Australian citizenship. The visa requires NZ nationals to have held a Special Category Visa for five years and to maintain an annual income of $53,900. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders residing in Australia are eligible for the Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa. By February 2018, 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goethe-Snape |first1=Jackson |title=Government's immigration tweak sees overseas Asians out, integrated Kiwis in |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-13/how-dutton-slowed-immigration/9646602 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title=Visa pathway for New Zealanders resident in Australia will cut migrant intake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/13/visa-pathway-for-new-zealanders-resident-in-australia-will-cut-migrant-intake |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=13 April 1018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa was criticised by Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim as a stealth means of favouring "English-speaking, white and wealthy" migrants.&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018" /&gt;

In early July 2018, Dutton ordered the deportation of controversial New Zealand [[Baptists|Baptist]] Pastor Logan Robertson, who had disrupted services at two mosques in [[Kuraby, Queensland|Kuraby]] and [[Darra, Queensland|Darra]] in Brisbane. Dutton approved Robertson's visa cancellation on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his visa, stating that "we have a wonderful tradition in our country of freedom of speech, but we're not going to tolerate people going to a place of worship and harassing others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crockford |first1=Toby |title=NZ pastor to be deported from Australia after public nuisance charges |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/105319868/nz-pastor-to-be-deported-from-australia-after-public-nuisance-charges |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson shows no remorse for harassing 'sissy' Muslims |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/deported-nz-pastor-logan-robertson-shows-no-remorse-for-harassing-sissy-muslims.html |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson doesn't regret harassing Muslims |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12097253 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson had early drawn controversy in New Zealand for his [[homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bath |first1=Brooke |title=Auckland pastor goes on rant, says gay people should be shot |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95818245/auckland-pastor-goes-on-antigay-rant?rm=m |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership challenges====
{{main|Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018}}
On 21 August 2018, Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] called a snap ballot of the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] following several days of feverish leadership speculation, of which Dutton was at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/20/04/28/peter-dutton-malcolm-turnbull-national-energy-guarantee-leadership-challenge|title=Peter Dutton leadership challenge speculation grows|date=20 August 2018|work=9 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton responded to Turnbull's ballot call by formally challenging for the leadership of the party and won 35 of 83 votes available, 7 short of a majority.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/21/liberal-leadership-dutton-turnbull-energy|title=Dutton resigns after Turnbull survives Liberal leadership spill 48-35 – politics live|first1=Amy|last1=Remeikis|first2=Gareth|last2=Hutchens|first3=Katharine|last3=Murphy|first4=Christopher|last4=Knaus|date=21 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton then resigned from the Ministry despite being offered by Turnbull to retain his position of [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]], and the media speculated that Dutton and his conservative backers in the party were likely to challenge for the leadership again in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afr.com/news/peter-duttons-backers-vow-its-not-over-for-malcolm-turnbull-20180820-h148mw|title=Peter Dutton's backers vow it's not over for Malcolm Turnbull|work=Australian Financial Review|date=21 August 2018|first=Phil|last=Coorey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Dutton called for another leadership spill, and [[Malcolm Turnbull]] tendered his resignation to the Governor-General. Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister [[Scott Morrison]] by 45 votes to 40.

Doubts surrounding Dutton's eligibility to be elected to parliament emerged on the grounds of [[Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia#(v) Pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Commonwealth|section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution]], as the [[family trust]] owned by Dutton operated a [[child care]] centre that received over $5.6 million in funding from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], in a situation similar to [[Re Day (No 2)|Bob Day's case]].  Although Dutton had received legal advice stating that he was not in breach of section 44(v), Labor had received contrary advice;  at Turnbull's request, the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] referred the matter to the [[Solicitor-General of Australia|Solicitor-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-refers-dutton-s-eligibility-to-solicitor-general-20180822-p4zyy6.html |title=Government refers Dutton's eligibility to Solicitor-General |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 August 2018 |last1=Loussikian |first1=Kylar |last2=McCauley |first2=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 August, Labor attempted to move a motion to refer Dutton's eligibility as an MP to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], in a similar manner to referrals made during [[2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|the recent parliamentary citizenship crisis]]. The motion failed by 69 votes to 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/labor-s-dutton-court-check-push-defeated|title=

Dutton opposes [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/peter-dutton-put-on-spot-over-samesex-marriage-by-lesbian-at-restaurant/news-story/afa5bc84e86d09ed71d696ba14f4e1eb|title=Peter Dutton put on spot over same-sex marriage by lesbian at restaurant|last=Smethurst|first=Annika|date=April 2, 2017|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 it was reported in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that Dutton "said privately it was inevitable that same-sex marriage would become law in Australia so it would be better for the Coalition, rather than Labor, to control the process".&lt;ref name="SMH_22March2017" /&gt; Dutton's actions publicly have been in opposition to same-sex advocates and "the forcefulness of Mr Dutton's attack on corporate chief executives last week - in which he told them to 'stick to their knitting' - has aroused suspicion among some colleagues who believed he was committed to achieving a breakthrough on [same-sex marriage]".&lt;ref name=SMH_22March2017&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/peter-dutton-working-behind-the-scenes-to-legislate-samesex-marriage-before-ceo-spray-20170320-gv2lcq.html|title=Peter Dutton working behind the scenes to legislate same-sex marriage before CEO spray|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=2 April 2017|author=Matthew Knott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Dutton was asked by a lesbian for clarification on his position, and he "told her he had been clear that he was against same-sex marriage".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In his political career, Dutton has voted "very strongly against same sex marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openaustralia.org.au/mp/peter_dutton/dickson|title=Peter Dutton MP, Dickson (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he voted in favour of the ''[[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017]]'', which legalised same-sex marriage; 65 percent of his constituency voted "Yes" in the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|jurisdiction=Australia |title=HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - Hansard|hansard=Record of Proceedings (Hansard)|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/chamber/hansardr/716f5e71-dee3-40a3-9385-653e048de81b/toc_pdf/House%20of%20Representatives_2017_12_07_5783_Official.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf |house=[[Australian House of Representatives]] |date=7 December 2017|page=13143-13145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, 31 CEOs signed a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling for a free vote in the Australian Parliament on same-sex marriage. In response to this letter, on 16 March 2017, Dutton said that the CEOs "shouldn't shove their views down our throats" and that CEOs who were "doing the wrong thing" should "be publicly shamed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Dutton’s comments were heavily criticised as an attempt to censor
expressions of support for same-sex marriage, with some commenters
also accusing him of hypocrisy given his support for changing

On 9 May 2017, a 67-year-old man pushed a pie into the face of Qantas CEO Alan Joyce while Joyce was speaking at a function in Perth. The next day, the assailant confirmed that the attack was to protest against Joyce's support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-10/qantas-alan-joyce-pie-thrower-against-gay-marriage/8513596|title=Man launched pie at Qantas chief Alan Joyce 'to oppose gay marriage'|date=10 May 2017|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton had singled out Joyce in his criticism of pro-same-sex marriage CEOs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/politics/stick-to-your-knitting-dutton-tells-ceos-to-stay-out-of-gay-marriage/news-story/e3e2cf4d8da68a0ffab57c42d6a27fa0|title=‘Stick to your knitting’: Dutton tells CEO’s to stay out of gay marriage|date=19 March 2017|website=News.com.au|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading some LGBTI advocates to hold him partially responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/alan-joyce-qantas-pie-anti-marriage-equality-protest/158123|title=Qantas CEO Alan Joyce Attacked With Pie Over Marriage Equality|last=Barber|first=Laurence|date=10 May 2017|website=Star Observer|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton condemned the attack on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PeterDutton_MP/status/861767699524763648|title=Peter Dutton|date= 9 May 2017|website=Twitter|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative gearing===
Dutton, who owns six properties with his wife, including a shopping centre in [[Townsville]], opposes any changes to [[negative gearing]] which currently offers tax breaks to property investors, stating that changing it would harm the economy.&lt;ref name="cadzow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cadzow|first1=Jane|title=Peter Dutton: 'I'm just not impacted by that hatred'|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/good-weekend/peter-dutton-im-just-not-impacted-by-that-hatred-20170516-gw5pt1.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dutton married his first wife when he was 22 years of age; however, the marriage ended after a few months. His eldest child, a daughter, was born in 2002 and splits time between her parents in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2003 Dutton married his second wife, Kirilly ({{nee|Brumby}}), with whom he has two sons.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=A45FB1EC9FDD775C9E8C80EABDC7041F?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=23682&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH1408093G46P6814N8|title=Good Cop, Bad Cop|author=Madonna King|date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=87234|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Peter Dutton|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Lecomte du Noüy''' ({{IPA-fr|ləkɔ̃t dy nwi}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forvo.com/word/lecomte_du_no%C3%BCy/ Forvo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 20 December 1883, [[Paris]] – 22 September 1947, [[New York City]]) was a French [[biophysics|biophysicist]] and [[philosopher]].  He is probably best remembered by scientists for his work on the [[surface tension]], and other properties, of liquids.

== Life and work ==

Du Noüy was a descendant of the French dramatist [[Pierre Corneille]]. His mother wrote many novels, one of which, ''Amitié Amoureuse'', was translated into 16 languages and ran for 600 editions in France. Born and educated in [[France]], du Noüy obtained the degrees of LL.B., Ph.B., Sc.B., Ph.D., and Sc.D.

He was an associate member of the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] working in [[Alexis Carrel]]'s lab from 1920 through 1928, Head for 10 years of the biophysics division of the [[Pasteur Institute]],&lt;ref name="DictPR"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33983842|title=Dictionary of philosophy and religion : Eastern and Western thought|last=Reese|first=William|date=1996|publisher=Humanities Press|isbn=0391038648|edition= New and enl.|location=Atlantic Highlands, N.J.|oclc=33983842|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the author of some 200 published papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ockenga, Harold J., ''Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation'', May 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented the [[Tensiometer (surface tension)|Tensiometer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/labs/descriptions/surface.tension/fisher.surface.tensiometer.manual.pdf|title=Fisher Surface Tensiometer Model 20 Instruction Model|last=Fisher Scientific Co.|first=|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|edition= 7th|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a scientific apparatus that used his [[du Noüy ring method]] to measure the surface tension of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.rockefeller.edu/sellers-exhibit/15/|title=Peter Sellers: A Pioneering Mathematician, A Renaissance Man|last=|first=|date=March 2017|website=The Rockefeller University Digital Commons|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Noüy believed that mankind should have confidence in science, but be aware that we know less about the material world than is commonly believed.

The following information is taken from one of his books:

: "Dr. Lecomte du Nouy is an internationally known French scientist. He was born in Paris in 1883, was educated at the Sorbonne and the faculty of Law. He now holds the degrees of LL.B., Ph.B., Sc.B., Ph.D., and Sc.D. In 1915, Dr. du Nouy, then an officer in the French Army, met Dr. Alexis Carrel, and through him became interested in certain problems that appeared to have no solution. His work in developing a mathematical expression of the process of healing of [[wound]]s brought him to the attention of the Rockefeller Institute. From 1920 to 1927, as an associate member of that Institute, Dr. du Nouy carried on his research into the properties of the blood. An instrument that he invented brought him an award from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. In 1927 he returned to Paris. Until 1937 he acted as head of the important Bio-Physics division of the Pasteur Institute. In that year he was named a director of the `Ecole de Hautes Etudes' at the Sorbonne. He and his American wife, the former Mary Bishop Harriman, lived in Paris under Nazi domination in the early days of the war, but escaped to the United States in August, 1942, to carry on his work. In the course of his full life, Dr. du Nouy has studied with Sir William Ramsay, and with Pierre and Mme. Curie. He has published some two hundred papers, mostly technical, and seven books on his researches and his philosophy of science. One of these, ''L'Avenir de L'Esprit'', ran to twenty-two editions in France in 1942 and was awarded a prize by the French Academy. Today Dr. du Nouy is known and respected by scientists of every land. In 1944 this respect was signalized by the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, when he was awarded the Arnold Reymond Prize, for his three books ''Le Temps et la Vie'', ''L'Homme devant la Science'', and ''L'Avenir de L'Esprit'', as the most important contribution to scientific philosophy in the past ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte du Noüy, P., ''Human Destiny'', New York, NY: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1947, 17th Printing, back fold-over sleeve of the book dust cover.&lt;/ref&gt;
:

==Telefinalism==

Du Noüy converted from [[agnosticism]] to [[Christianity]]. He supported a [[Theistic evolution|theistic]] and [[Teleology|teleological]] interpretation of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Simpson 1964"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1964). ''This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist''. Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, pp. 217–223.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Human Destiny'' he wrote that biological evolution continues to a [[Spiritual evolution|spiritual and moral plane]].&lt;ref name="Simpson 1964"/&gt; Du Noüy met [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] who shared similar interests in evolution and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, George Nauman, and Ralph E. Thorson (1970). ''Evolution in perspective: commentaries in honor of Pierre Lecomte du Noüy''. University of Notre Dame Press, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Noüy developed his own hypothesis of [[orthogenesis]] known as "telefinalism".&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Richard (1998). ''Catastrophism: Asteroids, Comets and Other Dynamic Events in Earth History''. Verso, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Du Noüy evolution could not occur by chance alone and that on an average since "the beginning of the world it has followed an ascending path, always oriented in the same direction." He accepted naturalistic evolutionary mechanisms such as [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] but believed science could not explain all evolutionary phenomena or the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;Halbach, Arthur Anthony (1948). ''The Definition of Meaning in American Education''. Cath. University of Amer. Press, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his telefinalist hypothesis a transcendent cause which he equated with [[God]] is directing the evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1964"/&gt;

His "telefinalist" hypothesis was criticized by [[Carl Hempel]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Hempel|Hempel, Carl]] (1950). "Problems and Changes in the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning". In ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'' 11:42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Koch]] and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] as nonscientific.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Leo (1957). "Vitalistic-Mechanistic Controversy", ''The Scientific Monthly',' Vol. 85, No. 5, pp. 245–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|If telefinalism, by postulating the intervention of an Idea, a Will, a supreme Intelligence, throws a little light on the combined transformations leading through an uninterrupted line to Man, it seems impossible not to see in the particular transformations limited to the species something more than the simple play of physico-chemical forces and chance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''Political subjectivity''' is a term used to indicate the deeply embedded nature of [[subjectivity]] and [[subjective experience]] in a socially constructed system of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, T., 2015. The politics of subjectivity in American foreign policy discourses. University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The notion of political subjectivity is an emerging idea in [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 
&lt;/ref&gt;. In some sense the term political subjectivity reflects the converging point of a number of traditionally distinct disciplinary lines of investigation, such as [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[political theory]], and [[psychoanalytic theory]]. Above all, the current conceptualization of political subjectivity has become possible due to a fundamental shift in humanities and social sciences during the 20th century, commonly known as the [[linguistic turn]].

Major figures associated with the question of political subjectivity come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, such as German philosopher [[GWF Hegel]], French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], French historian [[Michel Foucault]], American literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]], American cultural anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], American medical anthropologist [[Byron J. Good]], American philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], Canadian medical anthropologist [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi], Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]], Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Zizek]], Greek political theorist [[Yannis Stavrakakis]], and many others.

The term "political subjectivity" had been used in earlier literature, such as Steven Brown's book, ''Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |title=Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science |date=1980 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300025793}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to individual political view points as affected by social and personal psychological processes. But the term was later re-appropriated to refer to the much more intricate idea that the very experience of [[subjectivity]] is fundamentally political. According to Sadeq Rahimi in ''[https://www.academia.edu/12387120/Meaning_Madness_and_Political_Subjectivity Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "Politicality is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject is."&lt;ref name="Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahimi |first1=Sadeq |title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1138840823 |url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early (1981) book by [[Fredric Jameson]], ''[[The Political Unconscious|The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|title=The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act|date=1981|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=080149222X}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered one of the forerunners of the notion of political subjectivity.  In his book Jameson attributed what he termed a "political unconscious" to [[Text (literary theory)|text]], asserting that all [[Text (literary theory)|text]] has embedded in it, albeit in an implicit form, the encodings of the political history of the environment in which they have been produced.  He then proposed “the doctrine of a political unconscious,” as an analytic method for unearthing the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] repressed political memories of [[Text (literary theory)|text]], and “restoring to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history” (p.&amp;nbsp;20).  While Jameson's original theory of the political unconscious was primarily a [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] approach to [[literary criticism]], later proliferation and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization of theories of subjectivity have greatly expanded Jameson's original ideas to include the range of political, cultural and psychological processes within the framework of political subjectivity.

'''Regular script''' ({{zh|s=楷书|t=楷書|p=kǎishū|first=t}}; [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''kaisho''), also called 正楷 ({{zh|p=zhèngkǎi}}), 真書 (''zhēnshū''), 楷體 (''kǎitǐ'') and 正書 (''zhèngshū''), is the newest of the [[Chinese script styles]] (appearing by the [[Cao Wei]] dynasty ca. 200 CE and maturing stylistically around the 7th century), hence most common in modern writings and publications (after the [[Ming (typefaces)|Ming]] and [[East Asian gothic typeface|gothic]] styles, used exclusively in print).

Regular script came into being between the [[Eastern Han|Eastern Hàn]] and [[Cao Wei|Cáo Wèi]] dynasties,&lt;ref name=qiu143&gt;Qiú 2000 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and its first known master was [[Zhong Yao| Zhōng Yáo]] (sometimes also read Zhōng Yóu; 鍾繇),&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000 p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in the E. Hàn to Cáo Wèi period, ca. 151–230 CE. He is known as the "father of regular script", and his famous works include the Xuānshì Biǎo (宣示表), Jiànjìzhí Biǎo (薦季直表), and Lìmìng Biǎo (力命表).  [[Qiu Xigui]]&lt;ref name=qiu143/&gt; describes the script in Zhong’s Xuānshì Biǎo as:

{{quote|…clearly emerging from the womb of early period semi-cursive script. If one were to write the tidily written variety of early period semi-cursive script in a more dignified fashion and were to use consistently the pause technique (dùn 頓, used to reinforce the beginning or ending of a stroke) when ending horizontal strokes, a practice which already appears in early period semi-cursive script, and further were to make use of right-falling strokes with thick feet, the result would be a style of calligraphy like that in the "Xuān shì biǎo".}}

However, other than a few literati, very few wrote in this script at the time; most continued writing in neo-clerical script, or a hybrid form of semi-cursive and neo-clerical.&lt;ref name=qiu143/&gt;  Regular script did not become dominant until the early [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], in the 5th century; this was a variety of regular script which emerged from neo-clerical as well as from Zhong Yao's regular script,&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000 p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and is called "[[Northern Wei|Wei]] regular" (魏楷 Weikai). Thus, regular script has parentage in early semi-cursive as well as neo-clerical scripts.

The script is considered to have matured stylistically during the [[Tang Dynasty]], with the most famous and oft-imitated regular script calligraphers of that period being:
* The early Tang four great calligraphers (初唐四大家):
** [[Ouyang Xun]] (欧阳询)
** [[Yu Shinan]] (虞世南)
** [[Chu Suiliang]] (褚遂良)
** [[Xue Ji]] (薛稷)
* "Yan-Liu" ("顏柳")
** [[Yan Zhenqing]] (颜真卿)
** [[Liu Gongquan]] (柳公权)

==Characteristics==
Regular script characters with width (or length) larger than 5 cm (2 in) is usually considered larger regular script, or dakai (大楷), and those smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) usually small regular script, or xiaokai (小楷). Those in between are usually called medium regular script, or zhongkai (中楷). What these are relative to other characters. The [[Eight Principles of Yong]] are said to contain a variety of most of the strokes found in regular script.

Notable writings in regular script include:
* ''The Records of Yao Boduo Sculpturing'' (姚伯多造像記) during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]
* The Tablet of Guangwu General (廣武將軍碑) during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]
* The Tablet of Longzang Temple (龍藏寺碑) of the [[Sui Dynasty]]
* ''Tombstone-Record of Sui Xiaoci'' (蘇孝慈墓誌) of the Sui Dynasty
* ''Tombstone-Record of Beauty Tong'' (董美人墓誌) of the Sui Dynasty
* Sweet Spring at Jiucheng Palace (九成宮醴泉銘) of the [[Tang Dynasty]]

===Derivatives===
*[[Imitation Song typeface]]s ({{zh|c=仿宋體|p=fǎng Sòngtǐ}}) are typefaces based on a printed style which developed in the [[Song dynasty]], from which [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] typefaces developed.
*The most common printed typeface styles [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]] are based on the structure of regular script.
*The Japanese textbook typefaces ({{lang|ja|教科書体}}; [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''kyōkashotai'') are based on regular script, but modified so that they appear to be written with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]]. They also follow the standardized character forms prescribed in the [[Jōyō kanji]].
*[[Bopomofo|Zhuyin Fuhao]] characters, although not true Chinese characters, are virtually always written with regular script strokes.

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], a '''risk-seeker''' or '''risk-lover''' is a person who has a [[preference (economics)|preference]] ''for'' [[risk]].  While most [[investment|investors]] are considered [[risk averse|risk ''averse'']], one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. If offered either $50 or a 50% each chance of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble even though the gamble and the sure thing have the same [[expected value]]. 

Risk-seeking behavior can be observed in the negative domain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; for [[prospect theory]] value functions, where the functions are convex for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; but concave for &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Psychology==

===Child personality traits' effect on adulthood – What traits contribute to risk-seeking?===

In a study done by Friedman et al. (1995), they found significant evidence to support that low childhood conscientiousness contributed heavily to adulthood mortality. Those who were high in conscientiousness as a child were 30% less likely to die in their adulthood. Ultimately, their findings solidified that low levels of childhood conscientiousness predict risk seeking, and risk-seeking increases the chance of accidental death. Though risk-seeking deteriorates with age, risky exposure to abusive substances in adolescence can lead to lifetime risk factors due to addiction.  Conscientious individuals are subject to greater internal impulse control which lets them think out risky decisions more carefully, while those low on conscientiousness are more likely to endanger themselves and others by risky, or sometimes even criminal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, S., (2006). Methods by which childhood personality traits influence adult well-being. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 17, 264-268.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Psychometric paradigm=== 

The psychometric paradigm explores what stable personality traits and risk behaviours have in common with an individualistic approach. Zuckerman's (1994) sensation seeking theory is important in assessing the causative factors of certain risk-seeking behaviours. Many risk-seeking behaviours justify humans need for sensation seeking. Behaviours like adventurous sports, drug use, promiscuous sex, entrepreneurship, gambling, and dangerous driving to name a few both represent sensation seeking, as well as risk seeking.  Impulsivity has been linked to risk-seeking and can be described as the desire to indulge in situations with a potential reward, and little to no planning of the potential punishments of loss or reward. Impulsivity has also been linked to sensation seeking and in recent theories have been combined to form a higher order trait called impulsive sensation seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, M., Kuhlman, D. M., Joireman, J., Teta, P., 8c Kraft, M. (1993). A comparison of three structural models for personality: The big three, the
big five and the alternative five. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 65, 757-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychological paradigm=== 

The neuropsychological paradigm looks at why people make the decisions they do, as well as the neuropsychological processes that contribute to the decisions people make. This view looks less at impulsivity, puts more emphasis on cognitive dynamics and assumes people take risks because they have assessed the future outcomes.

===Men vs. women seeking risks===

Demographic differences also play a role in risk-seeking between individuals. Through an analysis done by scientists, they demonstrated that men typically seek risks more than women.&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, P., Miller, C., Schafer, D. (1999). Gender differences in risk
taking: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 125, 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; There are biological differences in men and women that may lead to the drive to seek risks. For example, testosterone plays a large role in risk-seeking in people and women have significantly lower levels of this hormone. This hormone has behavioural effects on aggression, mood and sexual function, all of which can lead to risk-seeking decision making. In their study, they also found that testosterone in excess leads to increased sexual enjoyment, and therefore more of an incentive to engage in risky unprotected sex.&lt;ref&gt;O'connor D., Archer, J., Wu, F. (2004) Effects of testosterone on mood, aggression, and sexual behaviour in young men: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. ''The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism'', 89, 2837-2845. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn, D. (2008) The psychology of risk-taking: toward the integration of psychometric and neuropsychological paradigms. ''The American Journal of psychology,'' 121, 363-376. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk-seeking utility function==
Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]].  Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first [[derivative]].  The utility function whose expected value is maximized is [[convex function|convex]] for a risk-seeker,  [[concave function|concave]] for a risk-averse agent, and linear for a [[risk neutral|risk-neutral]] agent.  Its convexity in the risk-seeking case has the effect of causing a [[mean-preserving spread]] of any [[probability distribution]] of wealth outcomes to be preferred over the unspread distribution.

'''''Rooi gevaar''''' ({{Lang-en|Red danger}}) is an [[Afrikaans]] phrase, sometimes translated into English as "Communist danger". The term gained popularity in [[South Africa]] during the [[Cold War]] and was associated with the perceived threat of [[World communism|international communism]] to religious, economic, and political freedom on the Southern African subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Gear&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Ian|title=Stuck in Middle GEAR: South Africa's Post-apartheid Foreign Relations|date=2001|pages=38-39|publisher=Praeger Publications|location=Westport|isbn=978-0275972752}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pretext was used to justify the banning of the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and its sister organisation, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which were regarded as leading anti-[[apartheid]] movements.&lt;ref name=Gear/&gt; Alternatively, the phrase '''''rooi komplot''''' ({{Lang-en|Red plot}}) was also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213084420/http://www.dailymaverick.co.za:80/opinionista/2013-12-10-my-old-south-african-flag|first=Ivo|last=Vegter |title=My old South African Flag |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-mentoring' is a process which requires you to assemble a realistic, accurate assessment of yourself (strengths and weaknesses) with the goal of crafting your ‘ideal self’ to heighten [[job performance]], career progression, or personal ambitions. This practice, suitable for any age, profession, gender, race, or ability, is a four-stage framework which includes: self-awareness, self-development, self-reflection, and self-monitoring.

==Self-Mentoring: An Individual Process==
In self-mentoring, YOU initiate responsibility for self-development by allocating time and commitment navigating your surroundings and organizing an environment where you lead personal and professional growth. Self-mentors identify and develop individual skills that align with internal and external resources to meet expectations using social and professional networks when needed (Carr, 2015). Leadership is a process, not an innate or taught set of skills (Lambert, 2003). Lambert, a scholar in leadership development, reveals supervision to include problem solving, broad-based and skillful participation, co-worker collaboration, and on-task performance. Those who aspire leadership positions need a structured approach to reach their full leadership potential (Bond &amp; Hargreaves, 2014).

Assimilating employees into an organization is a critical role for leaders (Lambert, 2003). Commitment from the employees as well as the supervisor is equally important. In 1999, Oakes, Quartz, Ryan, and Lipton stated, and it still holds true today, that unless there is commitment by those involved in change and growth, reigning behaviors will return. Self-mentors are devoted and passionate in sustaining their success. A sense of accomplishment is motivational enough for them to continue their endeavor and maintain personal empowerment and self-efficacy (Bond &amp; Hargreaves, 2014). Beckford (2012) agrees with the influence of self-mentoring to one’s position of personal power and ownership. You take control of your life as you journey on a path that is right for you.

Self-mentoring strengthens the existing culture in an organization. Barth (1999) views leadership as everyone’s work. Leaders grow when engaged with others to make sense of the world, reach out to new hires, commit to shared results, and develop identities as owners of their system - the organization. Self-mentoring provides a framework to welcome new employees, while also offering leadership opportunities to seasoned workers ready to step into supervisory roles. These positions may include administrative roles, responsibilities serving new employees, or a change in career direction.

==The Beginning of Self-Mentoring==
The benefits of using methods in self-mentoring when acclimating to new positions are abundant. This is especially true in the university setting. Academic professions are often self-directed within the domains of performance guidelines, review procedures, and promotion decisions employed by the university. Research suggests there is heightened [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]] with the application of self-mentoring practices. This, in turn, enhances connection and commitment to the institution (Bond &amp; Hargreaves, 2014).

To understand ways an individual can adapt to and apply self-mentoring skills, the following personal example illustrates this process. This case involves an instructor in higher education.

The detailed concept of self-mentoring (with all 4 levels embedded) was born as a result of a superintendent's adversities transitioning into higher education position. She found her new work at a university overwhelming as a disconnect persisted between her and her assigned mentor. While her mentor was more than proficient in ability and expertise, their mentor/mentee relationship struggled and wasn’t serving its purpose. Through the complexity of this experience, self-mentoring evolved as a tool the faculty member clung to and crafted in order to survive her new role.

In developing the process of self-mentoring, the new employee drew upon her innate as well as learned leadership skills and competencies. She established a plan for survival that involved setting expectations, forming strategies, gathering and analyzing [[data]], networking, and monitoring progress. Pleased with her success at the end her first year, she continued her job and more importantly began sharing her methods she fittingly named, ‘self-mentoring’ (Carr, 2015). The basic tenet leading this concept is ‘You are your own best mentor’ (Bond &amp; Hargreaves, 2014). Kimberly Horn (2013) explains there will always be times in one’s career when the right mentor-mentee match simply doesn’t happen. This is when self-mentoring becomes the perfect option for acclimating to the change(s) and growing personally and professionally as a result.

For this retired superintendent, the shift into a role of university practitioner was met with obstacles she surmounted through the process of self-mentoring. After the creation and follow-through of this practice, this professor was honored with three prestigious academic awards. Self-mentoring has now moved beyond the field of education and impacted weight loss programs, student leadership, mentoring, and executive coaching experiences (Carr, 2015).

==A Support Model==
[[Coaching]], [[mentoring]], and self-mentoring have parallel, yet exclusive characteristics. Each system or combination of systems has value for establishments. An organization is a living, breathing, and ever-changing system of interlocked subcultures. Individuals immersed in a new environment require skills to navigate through what can be treacherous waters. (Schein, 2010)  This system is a network of interdependent components that work together to accomplish the goals of an organization (Lezotte &amp; McKee, 2002), and individuals must grasp the system they are surrounded by in order to perform appropriately in it. They must identify explicit or implied expectations from the environment. This can be challenging for even the most experienced. Coaching, mentoring, and self-mentoring support individuals navigating within this environment, while each has a unique approach that must be aligned with the needs of the individual and the organization. Central to all three of these practices is the idea of self-development (Huang &amp; Lynch, 1995). Each practice advocates for the personal and/or professional development of an individual.

==Levels of Self-Mentoring==
(Carr, 2015)

&lt;gallery&gt;
The framework for self-mentoring.jpg|''The framework for self-mentoring''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are four levels of self-mentoring. Each level builds on the other.

* Level 1: Self-Awareness
* Level 2: Self-Development
* Level 3: Self-Reflection
* Level 4: Self-Monitoring

==Self-Mentoring Model==
(Carr, 2015)

The following chart illustrates the steps involved in all four levels of self-mentoring.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Self-Mentoring Model.jpg|&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Self-Mentoring Steps==
There are ten major steps aligned to each of the four levels of self-mentoring. Here is a chart listing the steps involved. At times, these steps may overlap among the four levels.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Levels !! Steps !! Steps !! Steps !! Steps
|-
| Level 1: Self-Awareness || Step 1 || Step 2 ||  || 
|-
| Level 2: Self-Development || Step 3 || Step 4 || Step 5 || Step 6
|-
| Level 3: Self-Reflection || Step 7 || Step 8 ||  || 
|-
| Level 4: Self-Monitoring || Step 9 || Step 10 ||  || 
|}

Here is a description to accompany each step in the process of self-mentoring.

===''Level 1: Self-Awareness''===

====STEP 1:  Talents and Challenges====
Recognize and identify talents and challenges in your environment, the people in your environment, and YOURSELF.

====STEP 2: Expectations====
Identify an expectation after compiling a list of potential options. Write down the expectation, so others can understand it if they read it.

===''Level 2: Self-Development''===

====STEP 3: Strategy====
Once you have your expectation, develop a measurable strategy(s). A strategy is an activity that can be used to gather data.

====STEP 4: Measuring====
The strategy must be measurable either quantitatively, qualitatively or through a mixture of both. You may count for frequency or observe for behaviors.

====STEP 5: Timing is Everything====
Establish a timeline to collect data. Include a starting and ending date.  Plan each day or week as you implement the strategy. Collect data until you reach the end of your timeline.

====STEP 6:  Collecting====
Collect data from your activities. It may be you watching a video and taking notes, or a comparison of your notes with your colleagues’ feedback of the same video.

===''Level 3: Self-Reflection''===

====STEP 7:  Reaching Out====
Consider an internal and external networking [[team]]. Reach out to experts in the field for advice, and/or just a few trusting peers for feedback and reflection time.

====STEP 8:  Making Sense of Everything====
Once data is collected and feedback is available, reflect on what the data is saying. What does it mean?

===''Level 4: Self-Monitoring''===

====STEP 9:  Reflection Time====
Reflect upon what you have learned and apply it to the situation to test your solutions. Did it work? Why or why not?

====STEP 10: Keep Your Eye on the Ball====
Monitor your accomplishment. Develop a periodic status check. Consider starting a new expectation and repeating the process.

==Conclusion==
While self-mentoring moves to the forefront as a useful [[self-improvement]] practice, it has established a noteworthy presence. This has been shown in isolation or in combination with mentoring and/or coaching methods. It may not serve everyone, but it does serve the majority of individuals who are motivated to take control and lead using a common sense approach to self-leadership. Self-mentoring draws on organizational skills that we all recognize yet often forget we possess until needed. Self-mentoring builds confidence in your ability to lead. After all, it is your life; you should lead!

'''Stencil codes''' are a class of iterative [[GPGPU#Kernels|kernels]]&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;

They are most commonly found in the [[Source code|codes]] of  [[computer simulation]]s, e.g. for [[computational fluid dynamics]] in the context of scientific and engineering applications. 
Other notable examples include solving [[partial differential equations]],&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; the [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] kernel, the [[Gauss–Seidel method]],&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; [[image processing]]&lt;ref name="Roth"/&gt; and [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]].&lt;ref name="Fey"&gt;

The regular structure of the arrays sets stencil codes apart from other modeling methods such as the [[Finite element method]]. Most [[Finite difference method|finite difference codes]] which operate on regular grids can be formulated as stencil codes.

==Definition==
Stencil codes perform a sequence of sweeps (called timesteps) through a given array.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Generally this is a 2- or 3-dimensional regular grid.&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt; The elements of the arrays are often referred to as cells. In each timestep, the stencil code updates all array elements.&lt;ref name="Sloot"/&gt; Using neighboring array elements in a fixed pattern (called the stencil), each cell's new value is computed. In most cases boundary values are left unchanged, but in some cases (e.g. [[Lattice Boltzmann methods|LBM codes]]) those need to be adjusted during the computation as well. Since the stencil is the same for each element, the pattern of data accesses is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;
  Yang, Laurence T.; Guo, Minyi. (August 12, 2005) 
  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qA4DbnFB2XcC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Stencil+codes&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=H8wdKyABXT5P7kUh4lQGZ9C5zDk High-Performance Computing : Paradigm and Infrastructure.]'' 
  Page 221. Publisher: Wiley-Interscience. {{ISBN|0-471-65471-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, we may define stencil codes as a [[N-tuple|5-tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(I, S, S_0, s, T)&lt;/math&gt; with the following meaning:&lt;ref name="Fey"/&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;I = \prod_{i=1}^k [0, \ldots, n_i]&lt;/math&gt; is the index set. It defines the topology of the array.
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the (not necessarily finite) set of states, one of which each cell may take on on any given timestep.
* &lt;math&gt;S_0\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; defines the initial state of the system at time 0.
* &lt;math&gt;s \in \prod_{i=1}^l \Z^k&lt;/math&gt; is the stencil itself and describes the actual shape of the neighborhood. There are &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; elements in the stencil.
* &lt;math&gt;T\colon S^l \to S&lt;/math&gt; is the transition function which is used to determine a cell's new state, depending on its neighbors.

Since ''I'' is a ''k''-dimensional integer interval, the array will always have the topology of a finite regular grid. The array is also called simulation space and individual cells are identified by their index &lt;math&gt;c \in I&lt;/math&gt;. The stencil is an ordered set of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; relative coordinates. We can now obtain for each cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the tuple of its neighbors indices &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = c + x\} \, &lt;/math&gt; 

Their states are given by mapping the tuple &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding tuple of states &lt;math&gt;N_i(c)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_i\colon I \to S^l&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
N_i(c) = (s_1, \ldots, s_l) \text{ with } s_j = S_i(I_c(j)) \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is all we need to define the system's state for the following time steps &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}\colon \Z^k \to S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \in \N&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
S_{i+1}(c) = \begin{cases}T(N_i(c)), &amp; c \in I\\
                           S_i(c),    &amp; c \in \Z^k \setminus I  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\Z^k&lt;/math&gt; and not just on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; since the boundary conditions need to be set, too. Sometimes the elements of &lt;math&gt;I_c&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by a vector addition modulo the simulation space's dimension to realize toroidal topologies:

: &lt;math&gt;
I_c = \{j \mid \exists x \in s: j = ((c + x) \mod(n_1, \ldots,  n_k))\}
&lt;/math&gt; 

This may be useful for implementing [[periodic boundary conditions]], which simplifies certain physical models.

=== Example: 2D Jacobi iteration ===

[[File:2D von Neumann Stencil.svg|thumb|right|Data dependencies of a selected cell in the 2D array.]]

To illustrate the formal definition, we'll have a look at how a two dimensional [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] iteration can be defined. The update function computes the arithmetic mean of a cell's four neighbors. In this case we set off with an initial solution of 0. The left and right boundary are fixed at 1, while the upper and lower boundaries are set to 0. After a sufficient number of iterations, the system converges against a saddle-shape.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I &amp; = [0, \ldots, 99]^2 \\
S &amp; = \R \\
S_0 &amp;: \Z^2 \to \R \\
S_0((x, y)) &amp; = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
0, &amp; 0 \le x &lt; 100 \\
1, &amp; x \ge 100
        \end{cases}\\
s &amp; = ((0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)) \\
T &amp;\colon \R^4 \to \R \\
T((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) &amp; = 0.25 \cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Stencils==

The shape of the neighborhood used during the updates depends on the application itself. The most common stencils are the 2D or 3D versions of the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] and [[Moore neighborhood]]. The example above uses a 2D von Neumann stencil while LBM codes generally use its 3D variant. [[Conway's Game of Life]] uses the 2D Moore neighborhood. That said, other stencils such as a 25-point stencil for seismic wave propagation&lt;ref&gt;

==Implementation issues==
Many simulation codes may be formulated naturally as stencil codes. Since computing time and memory consumption grow linearly with the number of array elements, parallel implementations of stencil codes are of paramount importance to research.&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;

  ''[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kdatta/pubs/EECS-2009-177.pdf Auto-tuning Stencil Codes for Cache-Based Multicore Platforms]'', 
  Ph.D. Thesis
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is challenging since the computations are tightly coupled (because of the cell updates depending on neighboring cells) and most stencil codes are memory bound (i.e. the ratio of memory accesses to calculations is high).&lt;ref name="Wellein"&gt;
  Wellein, G et al. (2009)

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Virtually all current parallel architectures have been explored for executing stencil codes efficiently;&lt;ref name="datta2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
at the moment [[GPGPU]]s have proven to be most efficient.&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;

  Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries==
Due to both the importance of stencil codes to [[computer simulation]]s and their high computational requirements, there are a number of efforts which aim at creating reusable libraries to support scientists in implementing new stencil codes. The libraries are mostly concerned with the parallelization, but may also tackle other challenges, such as IO, [[Computational steering|steering]] and [[Application checkpointing|checkpointing]]. They may be classified by their API.

===Patch-based libraries===
This is a traditional design. The library manages a set of ''n''-dimensional scalar arrays, which the user code may access to perform updates. The library handles the synchronization of the boundaries (dubbed ghost zone or halo). The advantage of this interface is that the user code may loop over the arrays, which makes it easy to integrate legacy codes&lt;ref name="walberla"&gt;
  S. Donath, J. Götz, C. Feichtinger, K. Iglberger and U. Rüde (2010)

  High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering, Garching/Munich 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;
. The disadvantage is that the library can not handle cache blocking (as this has to be done within the loops&lt;ref name="35dblocking"&gt;
  Nguyen, Anthony et al. (2010)
  ''[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1884658 3.5-D Blocking Optimization for Stencil Computations on Modern CPUs and GPUs]'',
  SC '10 Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt;)
or wrapping of the code for accelerators (e.g. via CUDA or OpenCL). Notable implementations include [http://cactuscode.org/ Cactus], a physics problem solving environment, and [http://walberla.net/ waLBerla].

===Cell-based libraries===
These libraries move the interface to updating single simulation cells: only the current cell and its neighbors are exposed to the user code, e.g. via getter/setter methods. The advantage of this approach is that the library can control tightly which cells are updated in which order, which is useful not only to implement cache blocking,&lt;ref name=schaefer /&gt; 
but also to run the same code on multi-cores and GPUs.&lt;ref name="physis"&gt;
  Naoya Maruyama, Tatsuo Nomura, Kento Sato, and Satoshi Matsuoka (2011)
  ''Physis: An Implicitly Parallel Programming Model for Stencil Computations on Large-Scale GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers'',
  SC '11 Proceedings of the 2011 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires the user to recompile the source code together with the library. Otherwise a function call for every cell update would be required, which would seriously impair performance. This is only feasible with techniques such as [[Template (programming)|class templates]] or [[metaprogramming]], which is also the reason why this design is only found in newer libraries. Examples are [https://github.com/naoyam/physis Physis] and [http://www.libgeodecomp.org LibGeoDecomp].

The '''Tamil units of measurement''' is a system of measurements that was traditionally used in ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking [[South India]]. 

These ancient measurement systems spanned systems of counting, distances, volumes, time, weight as well as tools used to do so. While modern India uses the metric system [[International System of Units]] (Tamil Nadu state included), some of these older day measurement systems, especially those of counting, are still used today.

Other units that have persisted are those of area – the 'ma' (not to be confused with the dollar-cent) and the ‘ground’, both used to measure land and the ‘molam’ which has been relegated to measuring the length of a [[sandanam garland]] sold on streets.

There are several similarities between the measurement system used in [[Tamil Nadu]] and that used by the [[Indus Valley civilisation]]. A shift of Indian mathematicians to South India after the 12th century&lt;ref name="iisc.ernet.in"&gt;[http://www.iisc.ernet.in/prasthu/pages/PP_data/105.pdf Indian Institute Of Science, Landmarks of Science in Early India - Michael Danino]&lt;/ref&gt; could be a driving factor for [[homogeneity|homogenisation]]. However, this remains a [[hypothesis]] because study of ancient science has been neglected in India.&lt;ref name="Neglected History"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-09-04/kolkata/27184974_1_manuscripts-restoration-library|title=Manuscripts narrate a tale of neglect|last=Gupta|first=Jayanta|date=September 4, 2003|work=Times of India|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1445">'''Tolman's rule''' states that, in a certain chemical reaction, the steps involve exclusively intermediates of 18- and 16 electron configuration.  The rule is an extension of the [[18-electron rule]].  This rule was proposed by American chemist [[Chadwick A. Tolman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=C.A.|title=The 16 and 18 electron rule in Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|year=1972|pages=337–353|doi=10.1039/CS9720100337}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, Tolman's rule, even for reactions that proceed via 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; steps, is incorrect because many reactions involve configurations of fewer than 16 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Many examples of homogeneous catalysis involving organometallic complexes involve shuttling of complexes between 16 and 18 electron configurations.  16-electron complexes often form adducts with [[Lewis base]]s and, if low-valent, undergo [[oxidative addition]].
:{{math|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I + ''cis''-[Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Rh(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}

Conversely, complexes of 18 electron configuration tend to dissociate ligands or undergo [[reductive elimination]]:
:{{math|[Rh(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  [Rh(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">[[File:Fußballschiedsrichter_und_Polizeischutz.jpg|thumb|[[Association football]] referees in Brazil with police protection.]]
'''Umpire abuse''' refers to the act of [[abuse]] towards an [[umpire]], referee, or other [[official]] in [[sport]]. The abuse can be [[verbal abuse]] (such as [[namecalling]]), or [[physical abuse]] (such as [[punch (combat)|punching]]). For example, [[Australian Football League]] spectators use the term "white maggot" (derived from their formerly white uniforms) towards umpires at games,&lt;ref name="whitemaggotdicdef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-white+maggot.html|title=Definition of white maggot|publisher=AllWords.com|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they do not agree with an umpire's decision.

Umpire abuse has become quite common in sport, practiced by players, coaches and spectators, with one [[Australian Rules Football|Australian Football]] league having half the [[tribunal]] cases heard about umpire abuse.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230154422/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-30|title=New umpire abuse rule for amateur footballers|last=Toy|first=Mitchell|date=2009-07-19|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=2009-07-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some high-profile cases of abuse towards the umpires in sport, with one Australian football player suspended for life after [[punching|striking]] an umpire.&lt;ref name="AFLlifeban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/03/2587921.htm|title=Footballer punches 16yo umpire, banned for life|last=MacBean|first=Nic|date=2009-06-03|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
In 1996, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player [[Roberto Alomar]] spat in umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during a dispute. Alomar received a five-game suspension for the incident, but the punishment was served during the following season, and not the 1996 playoffs. MLB umpires, upset over the lack of an immediate suspension, threatened to go on [[Strike action|strike]] before a federal judge prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Claire|title=An Error the Official Scorer Cannot Take Away|work=The New York Times|date=1996-10-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/sports/an-error-the-official-scorer-cannot-take-away.html|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], [[Angel Valodia Matos]] from [[Cuba]] pushed and then kicked a referee in the face during a [[Taekwondo]] match. He was disqualified for taking too much [[injury time]] in the [[playoff|bronze medal match]] by referee [[Chakir Chelbat]], before kicking Chelbat in the face. The referee required stitches in his lip after the attack. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] has banned Matos and his coach from taekwondo competitions for life.&lt;ref name="espn.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matos faces lifetime ban after kicking referee following match|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer08/judo/news/story?id=3549903|website=ESPN|accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Mark Jamar]], an Essendon [[Australian Football League|AFL]] player has been fined $1500 for umpire abuse. The umpire, [[Mathew Nicholls]], reported Jamar after he expressed his annoyance that he wasn't awarded a free kick in a marking contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Jamar fined $1500 for umpire abuse, Jack Ziebell cleared for bump on Sam Mitchell|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/essendon/mark-jamar-reported-for-umpire-abuse-in-essendons-clash-against-gws-giants/news-story/d4ac56f235688effe7890ddca9d2ef7c|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==
[[Sports league|League]]s and the like are trying to stop abuse towards umpires.

In [[Australian Rules Football]], attempting to strike or striking an umpire, abusing or threatening an umpire, or disputing an umpires decision is a reportable offense, per the [[Laws of Australian Football]]. It is also possible to send a player off for up to the remainder of the game for abusing an umpire, however this is only usually practiced at amateur and junior level. There have also been other programs trailed, such as making players suspended for umpire abuse attend umpire training sessions.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse" /&gt;

In [[cricket]], the preamble to the [[Laws of Cricket]] state that it is not within the spirit of cricket to abuse an umpire, and to dispute their decisions.

In [[ice hockey]], it is against the rules to dispute a [[referee]]'s decision, although the team captains can skate out and discuss the calls with the [[referee]]s and [[linesmen]]. After a warning (and a [[minor penalty]]), arguing with a [[referee]], or starting a fight with a referee is grounds for a [[game misconduct]], which results in ejection for the offending player or coach.

In [[baseball]], it is against the rules for any coach, manager, or player to question the [[umpire]]'s judgement on a call on the field, or on balls and strikes. If a [[coach (sport)|coach]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or player begins to walk toward the [[umpire]] with the intent to argue a call or balls and strikes, he will be warned to return to his bench or position. If he continues to advance, he will be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]].

=== Legal Implications ===

In the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]], some jurisdictions mandate more severe penalties when a person commits a crime against a sports official immediately prior to, during, or immediately following any athletic contest in which the umpire, referee, or judge is participating in an official capacity. For instance, in the State of [[California]], Section 243.8 of the Penal Code specifies that [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official shall result in a fine that does not exceed more than $2000, or imprisonment with the sentence not exceeding one year. [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official has more severe penalties than simple battery against a civilian, as in Section 243. California's maximum [[incarceration]] penalty for Battery on a Sports Official is twice as lengthy as the maximum sentence for Simple Battery.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 243.8|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/243.8.html|website=onecle|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[biosemiotics|semiotic theories]] of [[Jakob von Uexküll]] and [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A. Sebeok]], '''''umwelt''''' (plural: umwelten; from the German ''[[wikt:Umwelt|Umwelt]]'' meaning "environment" or "surroundings") is the "biological foundations that lie at the very epicenter of the study of both [[communication]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] in the human [and non-human] animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas A. |last=Sebeok |title=Contributions to the Doctrine of Signs |location=Lisse, Netherlands |publisher=Peter de Ridder Press |year=1976 |chapter=Foreword |page=x |isbn=0-87750-194-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The following reference seems to be incorrect, the phrase quoted comes up with a reference to Deely 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll, Jakob von]] 1920, 1934/1957; cf. Lorenz, Konrad 1971 (Studies in animal behaviour, Vol 2. Cambridge MA: Harvard Univ. Press)&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The term is usually translated as "self-centered world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kalevi Kull |last=Kull |first=Kalevi |year=2010 |chapter=Umwelt |editor-last=Cobley |editor-first=Paul |title=The Routledge Companion to Semiotics |location=London |publisher=Routledge |pages=348–349 |isbn=978-0-415-44072-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uexküll theorised that organisms can have different ''umwelten'', even though they share the same environment. The subject of ''umwelt'' and Uexküll's work is described by [[Dorion Sagan]] in an introduction to a collection of translations.&lt;ref name=Sagan&gt;{{cite book |title=A Foray Into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With a Theory of Meaning |author=Dorion Sagan |editor1=Jakob von Uexküll |editor2=Marina von Uexküll |editor3=Joseph D.

==Discussion==

Each functional component of an ''umwelt'' has a [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] and so represents the organism's [[model (abstract)|model]] of the world. These functional components correspond approximately to perceptual features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Gelade|first2=Garry|title=A feature-integration theory of attention|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1980|volume=12|issue=1|pages=97–136|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described by [[Anne Treisman]]. It is also the [[semiotic]] world of the organism, including all the meaningful aspects of the world for any particular organism, i.e. it can be water, food, shelter, potential threats, or points of reference for navigation. An organism creates and reshapes its own ''umwelt'' when it interacts with the world. This is termed a 'functional circle'. The ''umwelt'' theory states that the mind and the world are inseparable, because it is the mind that interprets the world for the organism. Consequently, the ''umwelten'' of different organisms differ, which follows from the individuality and uniqueness of the history of every single organism. When two ''umwelten'' interact, this creates a [[semiosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thure von |last=Uexküll |year=1987 |chapter=The sign theory of Jakob von Uexküll |editor-last=Krampen |title=Classics of Semiotics |location=New York |publisher=Plenum |pages=147–179 |isbn=0-306-42321-9 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jakob von |last=Uexküll |chapter=A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds |title=Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept |editor-first=Claire H. |editor-last=Schiller |location=New York |publisher=International Universities Press |year=1957 |pages=5– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, ''umwelt'' also unites all the semiotic processes of an organism into a whole. Internally, an organism is the sum of its parts operating in functional circles and, to survive, all the parts must work cooperatively. This is termed the "collective ''umwelt''" which models the organism as a centralised system from the cellular level upward. This requires the [[semiosis]] of any one part to be continuously connected to any other semiosis operating within the same organism. If anything disrupts this process, the organism will not operate efficiently.

Uexküll's writings show a specific interest in the various worlds that he believed to exist ('conceptually') from the point of view of the ''umwelt'' of different creatures such as [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]].

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is, according to [[Agamben]], ''"constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] 'carriers of significance' or 'marks' which are the only things that interest the animal"''. Agamben goes on to paraphrase Uexküll's example of the tick, saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all mammals, (2) The [[temperature]] of 37°C (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairy topography of mammals.

==Critics==
Uexküll's application of the notion of "umwelt" to the human person has been contested. In "Welt und Umwelt" and "Die Wahrheit der Dinge", the philosopher and sociologist [[Josef Pieper]] argued that reason allows the human person to live in "Welt" (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11510">'''The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding''' The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) is a leading Regional Peacebuilding organisation founded in 1998 in response to civil wars that plagued West Africa in the 1990s. Over the years, WANEP has succeeded in establishing strong national networks in every Member State of ECOWAS with over 550 member organisations across West Africa. WANEP places special focus on collaborative approaches to conflict prevention, and peacebuilding, working with diverse actors from civil society, governments, intergovernmental bodies, women groups and other partners in a bid to establish a platform for dialogue, experience sharing and learning, thereby complementing efforts at ensuring sustainable peace and development in West Africa and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wanep.org West Africa Network for Peacebuilding(WANEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
WANEP was founded by two distinguished Africans; Samuel Gbaydee Doe and Emmanuel Habuka Bombande. Sam Gbadyee Doe is a peacebuilding and development professional from Liberia. He began his academic career from the University of Liberia where he studied Economics with the intention of being a banker and later proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University for his MA in conflict transformation and Bradford University in the U.K. for a PhD. It was at EMU that the dream for the establishment of WANEP began when his paths crossed with John Paul Lederach and Emmanuel Bombande.

Mr. Emmanuel Habuka Bombande is a Ghanaian National Peacebuilding Practitioner with proven expertise in conflict transformation, peacebuilding, and development. After his social science degree from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-Kumasi Ghana, Mr. Bombande proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University, USA for a master's degree in Conflict Transformation. It was there he met Sam Doe leading to the birth of WANEP.

The story of WANEP cannot be completely told without mentioning the invaluable contributions of Professor John Paul Lederach especially during the formation and nurturing stages of the institution which he described as …”Beginning of a new era of peace, healing, reconciliation and hope in West Africa.” He was instrumental to bringing together and mentoring the two co-founders of WANEP.

Based on Sam Doe's background in working with trauma during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], and in establishing youth dialogue organizations and Bombande’s efforts with [[Hizkias Assefa]] at the Nairobi Peace Initiative&lt;ref name=NPI&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.npi-africa.org/aboutus}}&lt;/ref&gt; in resolving the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in northern Ghana, WANEP focused on both lessening existing conflicts and preventing future outbreaks. By directing efforts toward grassroots efforts the organization helped local leaders and citizens resolve conflicts without outside intervention.

==Leadership==
[[Samuel Gbaydee Doe]] served as the executive director of WANEP from its formation in 1998 until 2004. In 2004, then director of programs, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] was appointed executive director. In 2015,Dr. Chukwuemeka Eze, formerly the Program Director
took over from Bombande as the Executive Director while Levinia Addae-Mensah is the Deputy Executive Director/Program Director.

==Programs and Organizations==
WANEP has a niche in training CSOs, government and other practitioners in peacebuilding and conflict prevention.  This niche has worked well in supporting peace and averting conflict in many situations.  WANEP implements programs to equip the youth, business owners, women, traditional leaders and state agencies with requisite skills in conflict prevention and supports them to find local solutions or interventions to their unique conflict situations.WANEP emphasizes ownership and bottom-up approach to peacebuilding practice which enables the National Networks to carry out interventions that reflect the peculiarities of human security issues in their various countries. The national networks represent the WANEP brand and work in member states while the Regional Secretariat engages at the strategic level with ECOWAS, AU, UN and other intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations.

====Strategic Focus===
WANEP's key area of focus includes but not limited to the following;
 	Early Warning and Response (WARN)
 	Nonviolence and Peace Education (NAPE) 
 	Capacity-Building &amp; Development
 	Engendering Women in Peacebuilding Programs (WIPNET) 
 	Dialogue and Mediation
 	Civil Society Coordination and Democratic Governance
 	Gender
 	Research and Publication

==Key Impact/Achievements==
Under the WIPNET program, WANEP facilitated the Liberian Women Mass action for Peace initiated by Liberian Women in 2003. The women peace activism’s intervention in Liberia under the WIPNET program, led to the eventual ceasefire in the Liberian war. The outcome of the Liberian peace process and the role of WIPNET have been acknowledged all over the world and led to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Her Excellency Ellen Johnson and Lemay Gbowe (WANEP Liberia former Coordinator for the WIPNET program). The mass action for peace is credited with urging [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]’s government and the Liberians for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) into a ceasefire and leading to the end of the conflict. WANEP also facilitated the creation of ‘Peace Hut’ in Liberia to facilitate the reconciliation process and provide environment for victims to meet and reconcile with offenders. This concept was replicated in Cote d'Ivoire.

President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] has cited WIPNET as being one of the key factors supporting women’s prominent role in peace building in Liberia.&lt;ref name=reliefweb&gt;{{cite web|title=President Sirleaf Discusses Liberian Women’s Involvement in Peacemaking and Peacebuilding |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/president-sirleaf-discusses-liberian-women%E2%80%99s-involvement-peacemaking-and |date=27 September 2012|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, WANEP signed an MOU with the African Union Commission to provide support to the Commission’s Peace and Security Department in the implementation of the AU Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) including the gender mainstreaming of the architecture.

The work of WANEP in establishing an early warning system has been instrumental in helping to resolve multiple conflicts in early stages.  In 2014 this effort was officially recognized by [[Cote d’Ivoire]]’s permanent representative to the [[United Nations]] [[Youssoufou Bamba]] in his official remarks at the Informal interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect,", September 8, 2014.

WANEP experience in peacebuilding has been sought for replication in East and Central Africa. The unique structure of WANEP contributed to WANEP’s choice as the Civil Society implementing partner for the operationalization of ECOWAS Early Warning Mechanism (ECOWARN).

&lt;blockquote&gt;A cet égard, permettez-moi de relever le travail remarquable que fait la section ivoirienne de la West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, la WANEP-CI, qui a mis en place une système indépendant d'alerte précoce, notamment par la diffusion de rapports mensuels de la collection d'informations, relatives à la sécurité humaine, et qui vise bien entendu, à soutenir les actions de prévention des conflits, et de promotion de la paix en Côte d'ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Youssoufou | last = Bamba | title = Declaration Son Excellence Monsieur Youssoufou Bamba Ambassadeur Representant Permanent de la Republique de Cote d'Ivoire Aupres des Nations Unies |contribution= Statement by Cote d'Ivoire | contribution-url = http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/cote-divoire-french.pdf | series = UN General Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect," 2014 | year = 2014 | pages = 3 | place = New York | publisher = United Nations | url = http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2013 WANEP was also recognized for their work with ECOWAS to promote peace education in selected secondary schools across the region. &lt;blockquote&gt;[These studies] will impart new ways of thinking and new way of viewing conflict thereby leading to building new structures and cultural practices in the society that deepens peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Peace education must be well-pursued-WANEP |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=286528 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ECOWAS/WANEP relationship was the first example of civil society and intergovernmental partnership not only in West Africa but Africa generally. The partnership has been highlighted as the best practice of building alliances with CSOs in conflict prevention and is a referral point 
&lt;www.wanep.org/resource page&gt;

==Affiliations==
The organization works with several regional partners including the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the African Union’s Economic, Social, and Cultural Council [[ECOSOCC]], and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]](ECOSOC). WANEP is also a member of the Peace and Security cluster of ECOSOCC representing West Africa, and is the West Africa Regional Representative of the [[Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict]] (GPPAC)and the Focal Point for Africa CSOs on the AU-EU Joint Strategy (JAES).&lt;ref name=wanep&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wanep.org/wanep/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=11|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Partnerships==

In 2002, WANEP entered into a historic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the implementation of a regional early warning and response system referred to as ECOWARN. In 2004, WANEP and ECOWAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which has consistently been renewed. this inter-governmental structure acts as a regional early warning and response system. WANEP and ECOWAS partnership enables typically non-governmental organizations a path to Track 1 diplomacy efforts early on in conflicts.

Inspired by its desire to contribute and commit to the sustenance of peace during elections, WANEP in collaboration with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is implementing a five-year project (2015 to 2019) tagged, “Mitigating Election Violence in West Africa through National Early Warning Systems (NEWS)” in target countries of West Africa namely, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Through this project, WANEP set up and operationalized an Election Situation Room (ESR) during elections in those countries. WANEP also partnered with other key stakeholders to run ESR in countries such as Benin, The Gambia and Nigeria.

WANEP is working in partnership with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) in Accra, Ghana to run the West Africa Peacebuilding Institute (WAPI)

{{Main|Cutthroat trout}}

The '''yellowfin cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarkii macdonaldi'') is an [[extinct]] [[subspecies]] or variety of the [[cutthroat trout]], a North American freshwater fish.

==Natural history==
At the end of the last ice-age boulders and clay moraine blocked off a tributary of the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River]] in what is now the state of [[Colorado]]. The two [[lake]]s which formed were named the "[[Twin Lakes, Lake County, Colorado|Twin Lakes]]" by the area's settlers. Both lakes held small [[greenback cutthroat trout]] from the early days of the Wild West, but in the mid-1880s reports circulated of much larger trout, up to {{convert|10|lb|kg|0}} in weight, with bright yellow fins.

==Discovery and naming==
In July 1889, Professor [[David Starr Jordan]] and G. R. Fisher visited Twin Lakes and published their discoveries in the 1891 Bulletin of the [[United States Fish Commission]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} They found both the greenback and what they proclaimed to be a new species the "yellowfin cutthroat". In the species description, published in the 1890 edition of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum,&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David Starr and Evermann, Barton Warren. 1889. "Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado". Proceedings of the United States National Museum. Vol. XXI pages 453-454.[https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/13143 Description of the yellow-finned trout of Twin Lakes, Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan and Evermann described the fish as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Color, silvery olive; a broad lemon yellow shade along the sides, lower fins bright golden yellow in life, no red anywhere except the deep red dash on each side of the throat.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The subspecies was scientifically named ''macdonaldi'' after the US Fish Commissioner, [[Marshall McDonald]].

Jordan's specimens were recently re-examined by the fisheries biologist [[Robert J. Behnke]], who commented, "I have no doubt that Jordan was correct; the yellowfin trout and the greenback trout from Twin Lakes were two distinct groups of cutthroat trout".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Extinction==
Until about 1903, greenback and yellowfin cutthroats survived together in Twin Lakes, the populations remaining isolated as both breeders and feeders. The end for the yellowfin cutthroat came soon after the introduction of the [[rainbow trout]] to Twin Lakes. The greenback population interbred with the rainbows, resulting in [[cutbow]]s, but the yellowfin disappeared completely. The yellowfin is now  extinct.
