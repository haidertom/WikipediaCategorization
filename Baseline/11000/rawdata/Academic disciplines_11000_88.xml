'''Any-angle path planning''' algorithms are a subset of [[pathfinding]] algorithms that search for a path between two points in space and allow the turns in the path to have any angle. The result is a path that goes directly toward the goal and has relatively few turns.&lt;ref&gt;Tansel Uras and Sven Koenig. [http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS15/paper/viewFile/11295/10658 An Empirical Comparison of Any-Angle Path-Planning Algorithms]. Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pathfinding algorithms such as [[A* search algorithm|A*]] constrain the paths to a grid, which produces jagged, indirect paths. Any-angle algorithms are able to find optimal or near-optimal paths by incorporating the any-angle search into the algorithm itself. Algorithms such as A* Post Smoothing that smooth a path found by a grid constrained algorithm are unable to reliably find optimal paths since they cannot change what side of a blocked cell is traversed.

==Motivation==
Any-angle path planning algorithms are necessary in order to quickly find an optimal path. For a world represented by a grid of blocked and unblocked cells, the brute-force way to find an any-angle path is to search the corresponding [[visibility graph]]. This is problematic since the number of edges in a graph with &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; vertices is &lt;math&gt;O(V^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Searching the discrete [[grid graph]] can be done quickly since the number of edges grows linearly with the number of vertices, but the paths are not optimal since the angle of the turns are constrained to 45° or 90°, which will add turns and increase the overall length of the path. Smoothing a grid-constrained path after does not fix this problem since the algorithm that found that path did not look at all possible paths. Any-angle path planning algorithms find shorter paths than the grid-constrained algorithms while taking roughly same amount of time to compute.{{citation needed|reason=Are algorithms that search the corresponding visibility graph not considered any-angle path planning algorithms? According to whom, in that case?|date=December 2016}}

&lt;/ref&gt; - Uses geometric primitives (discrete circular arcs and lines) to represent the propagating wave front on the grid. For single-source path-planning on practical maps, it is demonstrated to be faster than graph search based methods. There are optimal and integer-arithmetic implementations.

Besides, for search in high-dimensional search spaces, such as when the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of the system involves many [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] that need to be considered (see [[Motion planning]]), and/or [[momentum]] needs to be considered (which could effectively double the number of dimensions of the search space; this larger space including momentum is known as the [[phase space]]), variants of the [[rapidly-exploring random tree]] (RRT)&lt;ref name=lavalle_tr98&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that (almost surely) converge to the optimal path by increasingly finding shorter and shorter paths:

== Applications ==
Hybrid A* was created by Stanford Racing as part of the navigation system for Junior, their entry to the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/junior08.pdf Junior: The Stanford Entry in the Urban Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hybrid A* is continuous and tracks the vehicle's position and orientation. This ensures that the path generated can be followed by the vehicle, unlike the paths generated by A* for Field D*, which both produce sharp turns, and do not consider the geometry or movement constraints of the vehicle.

'''Archaeoacoustics''' is the use of acoustical study as a methodological approach within the field of [[archaeology]]. Archaeoacoustics examines the acoustics of archaeological sites and artifacts. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes archaeology, [[ethnomusicology]], acoustics and digital modelling, and is part of the wider field of [[music archaeology]], with a particular interest in [[prehistoric music]]. Since many cultures explored through archaeology were focused on the oral and therefore the aural, researchers believe that studying the sonic nature of archaeological sites and artefacts may reveal new information on the civilizations scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=‘Sound Archaeology: An Interdisciplinary Perspective’, in Archaeoacoustics: The Archaeology of Sound, Linda Einix (ed).|last=Till|first=Rupert|publisher=OTS Foundation|year=2014|isbn=1497591260|location=Malta|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chichen_Itza_3.jpg|thumb|Chichen Itza in 2009.]]
Scientific research led since 1998 suggests that the [[Kukulkan pyramid]] in [[Chichen Itza]] mimics the chirping sound of the [[quetzal]] bird when humans clap their hands around it. The researchers argue that this phenomenon is not accidental, that the builders of this pyramid felt divinely rewarded by the echoing effect of this structure. Technically, the clapping noise rings out and scatters against the temple's high and narrow limestone steps, producing a chirp-like tone that declines in frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Jennie Cohen, [https://www.history.com/news/did-the-maya-build-chirping-pyramids Did the Maya Build Chirping Pyramids?], ''History.com'', 17 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lubman, [http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/136th/lubman.htm Archaeological acoustic study of chirped echo from the Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza, in the Yucatan Region of Mexico ...

==Study groups==
The [[International Study Group on Music Archaeology]] (ISGMA), which includes archaeoacoustical work, is a pool of researchers devoted to the field of music archaeology. The study group is hosted at the Orient Department of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung) and the Department for Ethnomusicology at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv). The ISGMA comprises research methods of musicological and anthropological disciplines (archaeology, organology, acoustics, music iconology, philology, ethnohistory, and ethnomusicology).

The Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, led by Rupert Till and Chris Scarre, as well as Professor Jian Kang of Sheffield University's Department of Architecture. It has a list of researchers working in the field, and links to many other relevant sites. An e-mail list has been discussing the subject since 2002 and was set up as a result of the First Pan-American/Iberian Meeting on Acoustics by Victor Reijs.&lt;ref&gt;Reijs, V.M.M., MegaSound: Sound in Irish megalithic buildings, First Pan-American/Iberian Meeting on Acoustics, 2002, Session 3aAA2, page 2284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in the US, the OTS Foundation has conducted several international conferences specifically on Archaeoacoustics, with a focus on the human experience of sound in ancient ritual and ceremonial spaces. The published papers represent a broader multidisciplinary study and include input from the realms of archaeology, architecture, acoustic engineering, rock art, and psycho-acoustics, as well as reports of field work from Gobekli Tepe and Southern Turkey, Malta, and elsewhere around the world.

The European Music Archeology Project is a multi-million euro project to recreate ancient instruments and their sounds, and also the environments in which they would have been played.&lt;ref&gt;” Alex Marshall, [http://ebook-dl.com/magazine/wired-august-20169632.pdf Music of the ages], ''Wired'', August 2016, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past interpretations controversy==
An early interpretation of the idea of archaeoacoustics was that it explored [[acoustics|acoustic]] phenomena encoded in ancient artifacts. For instance, the idea that a pot or vase could be "read" like a [[gramophone record]] or [[phonograph cylinder]] for messages from the past, sounds encoded into the turning clay as the pot was thrown. There is little evidence to support such ideas, and there are few publications claiming that this is the case. In comparison, the more contemporary approach to the field now has many publications and a growing significance. This earlier approach was first raised in the 6 February 1969 issue of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, where it was discussed in [[David E. H. Jones]]'s light-hearted "[[Daedalus (Ariadne)|Daedalus]]" column. He wrote:
{{quote|[A] trowel, like any flat plate, must vibrate in response to sound: thus, drawn over the wet surface by the singing plasterer, it must emboss a gramophone-type recording of his song in the plaster. Once the surface is dry, it may be played back.|Jones, 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = David E.H. | first = Jones | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Inventions of Daedalus: A Compendium of Plausible Schemes | publisher = W.H. Freeman &amp; Company | year = 1982 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7167-1412-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jones subsequently received a letter from one Richard G. Woodbridge III who claimed to have already been working on the idea and said that he had sent a paper on the subject to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The paper never appeared in ''Nature'', but the August 1969 edition of the journal ''[[Proceedings of the IEEE]]'' printed a letter from Woodbridge entitled "Acoustic Recordings from Antiquity". In this communication, the author stated that he wished to call attention to the potential of what he called "Acoustic Archaeology" and to record some early experiments in the field. He then described his experiments with making clay pots and oil paintings from which sound could then be replayed, using a conventional record player cartridge connected directly to a set of headphones. He claimed to have extracted the hum of the potter's wheel from the grooves of a pot, and the word "blue" from an analysis of patch of blue color in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Acoustic Recordings from Antiquity | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 57 | issue = 8 | pages = 1465–1466 | date = August 1969 | year = | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1449244 | doi = 10.1109/PROC.1969.7314| id = | last1 = Woodbridge | first1 = R.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, archeology professor [[Paul Åström]] and acoustics professor Mendel Kleiner performed similar experiments in [[Gothenburg]], and reported that they could recover some sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kleiner | first = Mendel | author-link = | last2 = Åström | first2 = Paul | author2-link = | title = The Brittle Sound of Ceramics - Can Vases Speak? | journal = Archeology and Natural Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 66–72 | year = 1993 | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' explored the idea: [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Pottery Record .28Archaeoacoustics.29|Episode 62: Killer Cable Snaps, Pottery Record]] found that while ''some'' generic acoustic phenomena can be found on pottery, it is unlikely that any discernible sounds (like someone talking) could be recorded on the pots unless ancient people had the technical knowledge to deliberately put the sounds on the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ancient-voices-recorded-into-pottery/ Ancient Voices Recorded Onto Pottery], ''Discovery.com'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] wrote: "Give science only a hundred more centuries of increase in geometrical progression, and she may be expected to find that the sound waves of Aristotle's voice have somehow recorded themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (manuscript circa 1902), "Reason's Rules," ''Collected Papers'' vol. 5 (1934), paragraph 542. The quote is from near the end.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Nigel Kneale]]'s 1972 BBC television play ''[[The Stone Tape]]'' helped to popularize the term 'stone tape theory'.
*An episode of ''Mysteryquest'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] called Stonehenge featured Rupert Till and Bruno Fazenda conducting acoustic tests at Stonehenge and at the Maryhill Monument, a full-sized replica of Stonehenge in the USA.
* [[Gregory Benford]]'s 1979 short story "Time Shards" concerns a researcher who recovers thousand-year-old sound from a piece of pottery thrown on a wheel and inscribed with a fine wire as it spun. The sound is then analyzed to reveal conversations between the potter and his assistant in [[Middle English]].
* [[Rudy Rucker]]'s 1981 short story "Buzz" includes a small section of audio recovered from ancient Egyptian pottery.
*A 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Hollywood A.D. (The X-Files)|Hollywood A.D.]]", features "The Lazarus Bowl", a mythical piece of pottery reputed to have recorded on it the words that [[Jesus Christ]] spoke when he raised [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead.
*In the 1996 game ''[[Amber: Journeys Beyond]]'', this phenomenon is referred to as 'stone tape theory' and a key part of the game's plot.
* ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' used this in 2005 episode "Committed", where an inmate's conversation is partially recorded on a clay jar.

'''Attorney misconduct''' is unethical or illegal conduct by an attorney.  Attorney Misconduct may include: [[conflict of interest]], over billing, refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives, false or misleading statements, hiding evidence, abandoning a client, failing to disclose all relevant facts, arguing a position while neglecting to disclose prior law which might counter the argument, and'' in some instances'' having sex with a client.

The advent of electronic record keeping and "e-discovery" has also resulted in a record number of attorney sanctions for a range of abuses from failure to produce to the leaking of sealed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2011/01/attorney-e-discovery-sanctions-at-all-time-high.html Attorney E-Discovery Sanctions At All-Time High], FindLaw blog, January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a case highlighting such abuses, in 2007 plaintiff's in a pharmaceutical lawsuit were found to conspire with attorneys and journalists to publicize protected discovery documents defying a judge's [[protective order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/042707womeldorf.pdf When conspirators defy protective orders], Washington Legal Foundation, April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Durham County, North Carolina prosecutor, [[Mike Nifong]], gained national infamy for a pattern of '''attorney misconduct''' related to the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal]].

[[Legal malpractice]] is a separate concept such as when an attorney fails to adequately, professionally, competently, or zealously represent a client.  While malpractice and misconduct may often be found in the same matter, they are separate concepts and need not both exist.

==Codification of rules and enforcement==

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has established model rules of professional conduct expected of attorneys, which most states in the U.S. have incorporated as part of their state laws.  Each state issues its own set of rules governing the ethical rules and the related enforcement of those rules, generally through their state [[bar association]]s.  As the state bar organizations and their enforcement mechanisms are composed of lawyers who set the rules, the regulation of attorney ethics is [[Industry self-regulation|self regulated and self policed]].  The self-regulation of any industry by its economic participants poses an inherent [[conflict of interest]] between the professional objectives of the members of the profession and those for whom the regulation would protect.  Some academic researchers and industry pundits have asserted that attorney discipline in the U.S. is ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie C. Levin, The Emperor's Clothes and Other Tales About the Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline Sanctions, 48 American University Law Review 1 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula A. Monopoli, Legal Ethics and Practical Politics: Musings on the Public Perception of Lawyer Discipline, 10 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 423, 425 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and favors lawyers and law firms.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Gallagher, "Ideologies of Professionalism and the Politics of Self-Regulation in the California State Bar," 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 485, 490-491.(1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual lawyers or their firms may be cited for misconduct by a judge in the originating proceedings or by a corresponding state bar.

'''CRISPR-Display ('''CRISP-Disp''')''' is a modification of the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complimentary targeting sequence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80-250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|448x448px|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90-4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|629x629px|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title="Cat's Cradling" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====

One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

'''Chariot burials''' are [[tomb]]s in which the deceased was buried together with their [[chariot]], usually including their [[horse]]s and other possessions. An instance of a person being buried with their horse (without the chariot) is called [[horse burial]].

==Finds==
Novokorsunskaya [[kurgan]] in the [[Kuban]] region of Russia contains a wagon grave of the [[Maykop culture]] (which also had horses). The two solid wooden wheels from this kurgan have been dated to the second half of the [[4th millennium BC|fourth millennium]]. Soon thereafter the number of such burials in this [[Northern Caucasus]] region multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Baumer, [http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/pages/?ID=1478 ''The History of Central Asia: The Age of the Steppe Warriors''.] I.B.Tauris, 2012 {{ISBN|1780760604}} p90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Fowler, Jan Harding, Daniela Hofmann, eds, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=2PAkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 ''The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe.''] OUP Oxford, 2015 {{ISBN|0191666882}} p113&lt;/ref&gt;

Three war chariot burials&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/asi-unearths-firstever-physical-evidence-of-copperbronze-age-chariots-by-manish-sain/1322979|title=ASI unearths 'first-ever' physical evidence of Copper-Bronze age chariots By Manish Sain|work=outlookindia.com/|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from around 2000 BC depicted as two wheeled open-vehicles on a fixed axle to carry one person along with three coffins, daggers, combs and antenna swords were excavated at [[Sinauli]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] state in [[India]].

The earliest true chariots known are from around 2,000 BC, in burials of the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in modern [[Russia]] in a cluster along the upper [[Tobol]] river, southeast of [[Magnitogorsk]]. They contained spoke-wheeled chariots drawn by teams of two horses. The culture is at least partially derived from the earlier [[Yamna culture]], where some wagon-burials are found, and is interpreted by certain scholars to have [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] features. The [[Krivoye Lake|Krivoye Ozero]] chariot grave contained a horse skull, three pots, two bridle cheek pieces, and points of spears and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Anthony, ''The Horse, The Wheel and Language: How bronze age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world'' (2007), pp. 397-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]] burials are  found in [[China]]. The most noted of these was discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang in central China's [[Henan]] Province, dating from the rule of King [[Wu Ding]] of the [[Yin Dynasty]] (c. 1,200 BC). A [[Western Zhou]] (9th century BC) chariot burial was unearthed at Zhangjiapo, [[Chang'an]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://english.people.com.cn/200203/16/eng20020316_92214.shtml|title= Excavation of Zhou Dynasty Chariot Tombs Reveals More About Ancient Chinese Society|publisher=People’s Daily Online|date= March 16, 2002|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, chariot burials are known from [[Iron Age]] (8th century BC) [[Salamis, Cyprus]], Tomba Regolini Galassi in [[Etruria]] (7th century BC), Italy, and from Beilngries (7th century BC), the [[Hallstatt C]] culture in Germany. Chariot burial was an Iron Age [[Celts|Celtic]] custom; while the wooden chariot has decayed, the [[horse harness]], usually in bronze, survives well, and enough is left of the iron wheel covers and other iron parts to enable well-informed reconstructions. Only the richest were buried in this way, and there are often many other grave-goods. The 4th-century [[Waldalgesheim chariot burial]] is one of the best known.  A tomb from the 4th century BC was discovered in [[Somme-Tourbe|La Gorge-Meillet]], [[Marne]] in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-archeologienationale.fr/homes/home_id20392_u1l2.htm Le Musée des Antiquités nationales: Les Âges du fer: La tombe à char de « La Gorge-Meillet »] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111190535/http://www.musee-archeologienationale.fr/homes/home_id20392_u1l2.htm |date=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; another (450-300) at [[Somme-Bionne]].

In addition to the Etruscan tomb in Italy, there are two chariot burials at [[Sesto Calende]], south of [[Lake Maggiore]], of the [[Golasecca culture]] dating to the 7th and 6th century BC accompanied by weapons, ornaments and a large [[situla (vessel)|situla]] &lt;ref&gt;The Princely Tombs of [[Sesto Calende]]. {{cite web |url=http://www.comune.sesto-calende.va.it/tur_cult/museoweb/english/1ferro_c/principesche/principesche.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719192500/http://www.comune.sesto-calende.va.it/tur_cult/museoweb/english/1ferro_c/principesche/principesche.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while an earlier burial of the same culture, at Ca' Morta - [[Como]] (c. 700 BC), included a four-wheeled wagon in the tomb.

In England, chariot burials are characteristic of, and almost confined to, the Iron Age [[Arras culture]] associated with the [[Parisii (Yorkshire)|Parisii]] tribe. Finds of such burials are rare, and the persons interred were presumably chieftains or other wealthy notables. The [[Wetwang Slack]] chariot burial of c. 300 BC is unusual in that a woman was interred with the chariot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/the_wetwang_chariot_burial/the_wetwang_chariot_burial.aspx British Museum: The Wetwang Chariot Burial]&lt;/ref&gt; Some 21 British sites are known, spanning approximately four centuries, virtually all in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/chariot_burials/ Yorkshire History: Iron Age Chariot Burials]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ferrybridge and [[Newbridge chariot|Newbridge]] (near [[Edinburgh]]) chariots are unusual in Britain as they are the only ones to be buried intact.&lt;ref name="newbridge"&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba76/feat3.shtml British Archaeology 76, May 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial custom seems to have disappeared after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

'''Chromosome combing''' (also known as molecular combing or DNA combing)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Alignment and sensitive detection of DNA by a moving interface.|journal=Science|volume=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique used to produce an array of uniformly stretched [[DNA]] that is then highly suitable for [[nucleic acid hybridization]] studies such as [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|fluorescent in situ hybridisation]] (FISH) which benefit from the uniformity of stretching, the easy access to the hybridisation target sequences,&lt;ref name="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5331/1518.long"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5331/1518.long],&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[X-ray crystallography|resolution]] offered by the large distance between two probes, which is due to the stretching of the DNA by a factor of 1.5 times the crystallographic length of DNA.

DNA in solution (i.e. with a randomly-coiled structure) is stretched by retracting the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] of the solution at a constant rate (typically 300&amp;nbsp;µm/s). The ends of DNA strands, which are thought to be frayed (i.e. open and exposing polar groups) bind to ionisable groups coating a [[silanization|silanized]] glass plate at a [[pH]] below the [[pKa]] of the ionizable groups (ensuring they are charged enough to interact with the ends of DNA). The rest of the DNA, which is mostly dsDNA, cannot form these interactions (aside from a few ‘touch down’ segments along the length of the DNA strand) so is available for hybridisation to probes. As the meniscus retracts, surface retention creates a force that acts on DNA to retain it in the liquid phase; however this force is inferior to the strength of the DNA’s attachment; the result is that the DNA is stretched as it enters the air phase; as the force acts in the locality of the air/liquid phase, it is invariant to different lengths or conformations of the DNA in solution, so DNA of any length will be stretched the same as the meniscus retracts. As this stretching is constant along the length of a DNA, distance along the strand can be related to base content; 1&amp;nbsp;µm is approximately equivalent to 2&amp;nbsp;kb.

DNA regions of interest are observed by hybridising them with probes labelled by [[hapten]]s like [[biotin]]; this can then be bound by one or more layers of fluorochrome-associated ligands (such as immunofluorescence antibodies). Multicolour tagging is also possible. This has several potential uses, typically as a high-resolution physical mapping technique (e.g. for positional cloning), an example of which was the correct mapping of 200&amp;nbsp;kb of the CAPN3 gene region, or the mapping of non-overlapping sequences (since the distance between two probes can be accurately measured). It is therefore useful for finding exons, microdeletions, amplifications, or rearrangements. Before the combing improvement, FISH was too low-res to be of use in this case. With this technique, the resolution of FISH is theoretically limited only by the resolution of the [[fluorescence microscopy|epifluorescence microscope]]; in practice, resolutions of around 2&amp;nbsp;µm are obtained, for DNA molecules usually 200–600&amp;nbsp;kb long (though combing-FISH has been used with some success on molecules in excess of 1&amp;nbsp;Mb long), and there may be room for improvement through optimisation. Since DNA analyses using this technique are single-molecule, genomes from different cells can be compared to find anomalies, with implications for diagnosis of cancer and other genetic alterations.

Chromosome combing is also used to study [[DNA replication]], a highly regulated process that is reliant on a specific program of temporal and spatial distribution of activation of [[origin of replication|origins of replication]]. Each origin occupies a distinct genetic locus and must fire only once per [[cell cycle]]. Chromosome combing allows a genome-wide view of the firing of origins and propagation of [[replication fork]]. As no assumptions are made about the sequence of the origins, this technique is particularly useful for mapping origins in [[eukaryote]]s, which are not thought to have precisely defined initiation sequences.

Strategies involving combing recently replicated DNA typically involve incorporating modified nucleotides (such as BrdU, [[bromodeoxyuridine]]) into the nascent DNA, then fluorescently detecting it. As replication forks spread bidirectionally from origins of replication at (approximately) equal speeds,&lt;ref name="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1949372/?tool=pubmed"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1949372 | pmid=17522385 | doi=10.1091/mbc.E06-08-0689 | volume=18 | title=Replication fork velocities at adjacent replication origins are coordinately modified during DNA replication in human cells | journal=Mol Biol Cell | pages=3059–67 | last1 = Conti | first1 = C | last2 = Saccà | first2 = B | last3 = Herrick | first3 = J | last4 = Lalou | first4 = C | last5 = Pommier | first5 = Y | last6 = Bensimon | first6 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; then origin position can be inferred. Replacing the modified nucleotide pool with a different type of modified nucleotide after a certain amount of time allows development of a time-resolved picture of the firing of sites, and the kinetics of replication forks. Pause sites can be identified, merged replication forks resolved, and the frequency of origin firings in different time periods to be studied.

Firing frequencies have shown in ''in vitro'' studies of Xenopus laevis egg extract to increase as S phase progresses. In another study&lt;ref name="Han"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Han, Kocher et al |title=Visualizing regional distribution of firing events in the Epstein-Barr virus episome using hybridized probes |journal=Methods in Biomolecular Research |date=2009 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=1351-1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Epstein-Barr virus [[episome]]s, hybridised probes were used to visualise the regional distribution of firing events; a particular zone showed preference for firing, whilst a few pause sites were also inferred.

The '''conservation and restoration of photographic plates''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[photographic plates]] in order to preserve their materials and content. It covers the necessary measures that can be taken by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[curators]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and other museum professionals to conserve the material unique to photographic plate processes. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the [[preventive conservation]] and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|interventive conservation]] measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. 

__TOC__

==History==

===Composition===

The term [[photographic plates]] refers to a type of [[photograph]] that consists of an image bound to a [[glass]] support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, [[Black and White Photography|black-and-white]] photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the [[emulsion]]. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, [[glass]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the photographic process, "fixing," is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Photography|title=Glass Negatives|url=http://www.somersetphotography.com/glass_negatives.htm|website=History of Photography|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processes===

[[File:Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady -1 (4984137358).jpg|thumb|Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady]]
* '''Collodion glass plate negative:''' This process was invented by the Englishman [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851. While the first process to take advantage of glass plates was an [[albumen]], it was quite laborious and quickly surpassed by the [[collodion]] glass plate negative in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paris Photo|title=Collodion Glass Plate Negative|url=https://www.parisphoto.com/en/Glossary/Collodion-Glass-Plate-Negative/|website=Paris Photo|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collodion photographic process was a wet place process, which meant that the glass plate itself had to be wet while it was exposed and throughout processing. This required a portable darkroom to be taken wherever a photographer went in order to successfully produce a negative image. During the process, the collodion was the binder which was poured onto the glass plate before being exposed. The glass plate was then [[developed]], [[Fixer (photography)|fixed]], [[Washing (photography)|washed]], and protected with a [[varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gelatin dry plate negative:''' This process was invented by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871, but it was not commonly used until 1878 when the process became commercially successful. Because of the advances this process made in photography, it soon replaced the [[wet plate process]] in the 1880s. The collodion binder formerly used was replaced by [[gelatin]] which already contained the light-sensitive silver salts. This meant that the emulsion was already present and did not have to be painted on the glass plate right before exposure - which now only took less than one second. Because of this advancement, photographers did not have to carry their portable darkroom, but could develop later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1878 when further improvements were made to the gelatin emulsion, gelatin glass plates began being mass produced by companies such as Wratten &amp; Wainright, Keystone Dry Plate Works, and notably the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advanced use and production of photographic glass plates until around 1925 and the development of the modern photography industry.

==Agents of deterioration== 

[[Photographic plates]] face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following:

===Relative humidity &amp; temperature===

[[Relative humidity]] (RH) and [[temperature]] are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract [[pest (organism)|pest]]s. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. 

Photographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the [[gelatin]] to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause [[emulsion]] to crack or separate along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause [[mold]] to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casella|first1=Luisa|title=Gelatin Dry-plate|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Gelatin_Dry-plate|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, [[varnish]], and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the [[Binder (material)|binder]] and [[dehydration]] of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light===

Photographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. [[Sunlight]] is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other [[UV light|UV lighting]] all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing [[fading]] and [[yellowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Light]] is especially threatening to [[Color photography|color photographic materials]] since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the [[pigments]].

===Air pollution===

[[Air pollution]] can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor [[air quality]] and [[dirt]] that can damage the materials. This can include [[dust]], gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]]. Other sources of air pollution include "photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies," as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material/chemical===

The glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an [[Inherent_vice_(library_and_archival_science)|inherent vice]], "sick glass" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this [[glass corrosion]]. The effect of "sick glass" can be weeping and [[crizzling]] which can be caused by excessive [[alkali]] present and a lack of [[stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElhone|first1=John P.|title=Cased photographs: Including Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes (Collodion Positives), and Tintypes|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Cased_Photographs|website=AIC Wiki|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo [[Oxidation|oxidative deterioration]] which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of [[cellulose nitrate]] which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avdella, izgorena, 1905.jpg|thumb|Broken glass plate - Avdella, izgorena, 1905]]

===Physical===

Glass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and [[brittle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to [[breakage]], [[Fracture|cracks]], and [[fractures]]. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. 

Types of breakage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Impact break - point of impact and surrounding radiating arcs
* Cracks - run perpendicular to applied stress
* Blind cracks - breaks do not carry through the whole shard of glass

Certain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways.

==Preventive conservation== 

===Environment===

Environmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. [[Relative humidity]] (RH), [[temperature]], and [[light]] play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation:

* For photographic glass plates, the temperature is kept cool at around 65°F approximately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RH levels are normally kept between 30-40%. If RH goes below 30%, the image binder of the glass plate will [[dehydrate]]. If RH goes above 40%, the glass will begin [[hydrate|hydrating]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For cased glass plate photographs, such as [[ambrotypes]], RH levels are kept between 40-50% and temperature between 65-68°F. These levels differ because of the case and its risk for [[embrittlement]], [[brass]] mat, and glass deterioration. 
* Fluctuations, also called “cycling,” in RH and temperature are sought to be avoided. Environmental fluctuations can contribute to [[mold growth]], chemical deterioration including discoloration and [[yellowing]], as well as deterioration of the emulsion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html#Structure|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Photographic glass plates, especially [[Negative (photography)|negatives]], are preserved in dark enclosures due to their risk of deterioration when exposed to light, particularly [[UV light|UV]] and [[sunlight]]. If displayed, spot-lighting, which is uneven heating to the photographic plate, is avoided. Light levels are kept below 50 [[lux]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===

Photographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage – the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: 

* To prevent fingerprints, non-vinyl plastic gloves are worn when handling – either [[Latex]] or [[Nitrile]]. [[Cotton]] gloves are not recommended by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] due to the possibility of glass easily slipping from the cotton material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When handling, a glass plate is not held by one edge or corner, rather it is held by two opposite edges and always with two hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When laying the glass plate on a flat surface, it is always placed with the [[emulsion]] side up. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass plates are never stacked or have any pressure placed upon them. The sleeve or enclosure is labeled before placing the glass plate inside. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since glass plates are fragile and brittle, duplicates are created if a glass plate is used often for [[Photo printing|printing]]. This helps to minimize the threat of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage=== 

Storage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. [[Museums]] and other [[cultural institutions]] take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: 

* Photographic glass plates are housed in four-flap enclosures, emulsion side up. These four-flap buffered enclosures prevent a glass plate from being pulled in and out and further deteriorating the image through flaking and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasions]]. Rather, the four-flap enclosure allows the glass plate to be accessed by unfolding the flaps without having to pull the plate across any surface or material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The photographic glass plates are stored vertically on the long side of the plate in [[acid]]- and [[lignin]]-free storage boxes. The glass plates are not packed too tightly and are sought not to rub against each other. Each one is usually separated individually with stiffeners made of acid-free folder stock or acid-free cardboard in order to support the plates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photographic glass plates stored in a partially filled box will have spacers, most likely [[acid-free]] [[Corrugated fiberboard|corrugated]] [[paperboard]], inserted in order to prevent significant bumping or moving. 
* Glass plates that are larger than 10” x 12” are stored in legal size boxes that are partially filled to prevent a too heavy weight. The extra space in the box is filled with board or spacers to avoid shifting and jostling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Storage boxes consisting of photographic glass plates are stored on a lower shelf, specifically below four feet. This helps to prevent someone from lifting them down from above his or her head. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each storage box of photographic glass plates is labeled with words such as “Heavy,” “Handle with Care,” “Caution: Contains Glass Negatives,” so that everyone knows to be extra careful when lifting the box off a shelf. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Storage of broken photographic plates====
 
Broken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways:

* Broken glass plates are not stacked but stored flat.
* Photographic glass plates that are cracked or have binder damage are stored on sink-mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with minor flaking are still housed in the four-flap enclosure that is labeled appropriately describing the damage. Glass plates with extensive flaking are stored on sink-mats horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Broken glass plate shards are often “sandwiched” in between two pieces of buffered board and then placed inside the four-flap enclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Institute for Conservation|AIC]] advises that form-fit support should be created for broken glass shards by cutting out two pieces of 4-ply [[mat board]] that fit to each shard. Then, these pieces are glued to each side of the buffered board with either [[wheat starch paste]] or 3M #415 double-stick tape. By placing each shard in between the form-fit support, this will help to prevent further damage. These broken shards are then placed in individual four-flap enclosures and stored flat with appropriate labeling that warns of their broken condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another method of storing broken shards is to place them on sink-mats. If this method is used, each piece is separated with paperboard spacers to prevent the pieces from touching. These paperboard spacers are sometimes attached with [[adhesives]] to the mat so that physical damage does not occur to the shards. They are stored horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance/housekeeping===

Maintenance/[[housekeeping]] of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: 

* For their preservation, light cleaning is carried out occasionally by removing dust with a soft brush. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] also keep the surrounding collections area clean of [[dust]], [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, and any other debris that may attract pests. Also, food and drink is not permitted in the storage area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|title=Caring for Your Treasures|url=https://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/photographs#.WsLQ8MPwbIU|website=AIC|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent deterioration from [[air pollutants]], it is helpful for conservators to have the air entering the storage area [[filtered]] and purified, windows closed, [[obsolete]]/outdated media minimized, and enclosures and cabinets used to protect collection objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatment==

Broken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation treatment]]. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: 

'''[[Adhesives]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used)
* [[Paraloid B-72]] - A solution of 50-70% B-72 in a solvent with added [[silica]] is used to reassemble glass plate fragments. It takes 1-2 hours to dry. One issue with this adhesive is that it creates "snowflakes" in between the pieces making an invisible reassembly impossible.
* [[Epoxy resin]] - This adhesive is thought to be very strong and has low shrinkage. An issue with this method is that it yellows over time and is not advisable to be used on glass plates with a collodion binder. This is due to the potential damage to the collodion binder of the reversibility method. 
* [[Cyanoacrylates]] - This adhesive bonds strongly with [[alkaline]] surfaces but is very brittle and only used for temporary repairs.

'''Application:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wicking]] - This is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] to apply the adhesive to the glass with a wooden or glass applicator. A [[capillary]] tube or bottle is used to put the appropriate amount of adhesive on the glass shard without excess. 

'''Backing material:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Silpat™ sheet - This is made of [[silicone]] and [[fibreglass]]; textured and provides air pockets to prevent damage from capillary application; it does not create trauma for the [[emulsion]] side of the glass. 
* Secondary support is used for glass plates broken into many pieces or over 5 x 7 inches in size - A second piece of glass is used with silicone as a material to be inserted as a barrier layer.

'''Repair methods &amp; techniques:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[PhotoShop |PhotoShop Software]] assembly - Virtually assembling broken glass shards through Photoshop by scanning or photographing all pieces is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]]. This helps to avoid further damage and deterioration of the glass plate photograph. 
* Inclined assembly - This method involves applying an adhesive to the glass shard interfaces and assembling them on an inclined surface covered with [[Mylar]] or Silpat™. The glass shards are reassembled either by direct application, which involves applying the adhesive directly to the shard interface and attaching it to its corresponding piece; or they are assembled through wicking where the adhesive is applied to the shard interface through capillary action. 
* Vertical assembly - This method is used because of the manner in which the glass shards fit back together, which is the most accurate vertically. This also helps to protect the side of the binder layer. When assembling the pieces vertically, pressure sensitive plastic tape or sticky wax is used to hold the pieces together. The adhesive is not applied until all of the pieces are assembled - this helps to recognize any misalignment before they are adhered together. As the last step, the adhesive is applied through wicking. 
* Light-line - This is often used to insure all of the pieces are aligned. A light-line creates a straight line of light that allows a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] to see any misalignment by producing a crooked line. Once the pieces are aligned, the light-line will be straight again.

'''The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Jam Meng|title=The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf|website=AIC|publisher=The American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vertical assembly method along with a light-line is used in [http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre] as outlined in the [[case study]]. This study shows how [[conservators]] deal with other conservation issues as well including accretions and residue. 
* For instance, while the plates were considered structurally stable, they may have needed surface cleaning. This was completed by using [[Cotton swab|swab]]s dampened with water/ethanol solutions in order to reduce [[stain]]s or do away with any left tape residue.
* Pressure sensitive labels were removed mechanically. 
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] used Whatman lens tissues to wipe off any other residue marks.

[[File:CIMS Lecture Hall.jpg|thumb|Lecture Hall at Warren Weaver Hall]]
The Graduate Department of Computer Science offers a PhD in computer science. In addition it offers Master of Science degrees in computer science, information systems (in conjunction with the [[Stern School of Business]]), and in scientific computing. For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.

The Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies. The MacCracken funding is renewable for a period of up to five years, assuming satisfactory progress toward the degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/gsas/admissions/financial-aid/maccracken-housing-program-for-doctoral-students.html|title=MacCracken Housing Program for Doctoral Students|author=|date=|website=gsas.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation and defense of the doctoral thesis. Courant Students in Ph.D. programs may earn a master's degree while in progress toward the Ph.D program. Areas where there are special funding opportunities for graduate students include: Mathematics, Mechanics, and Material Sciences, Number Theory, Probability, and Scientific Computing. All PhD candidates are required to take a written comprehensive examination, oral preliminary examination, and create a dissertation defense. Each supported doctoral student has access to his or her own dedicated Unix workstation. Many other research machines provide for abundant access to a variety of computer architectures, including a distributed computing laboratory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/degree/phd/ |title=The Ph.D. Program |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate program===
The Courant Institute houses New York University's undergraduate programs in computer science and mathematics. In addition, CIMS provides opportunities and facilities for undergraduate students to do and discuss mathematical research, including an undergraduate math lounge on the 11th floor and an undergraduate computer science lounge on the 3rd floor of Warren Weaver Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |title=Math Lounge |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174327/http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?Itemid=5&amp;id=91&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=New York University - MSc Mathematics in Finance |publisher=Global-derivatives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CIMS Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom at Warren Weaver Hall]]
The mathematics and computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative and problem-solving skills through teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ |title=Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers around the world on their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU &gt; A &amp; S &gt; Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics. The BA degree can also be pursued with honors. Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/minors |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Computer Science Minors |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduation===
The Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.

===Academic research===
[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]
The Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character — with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].

Since 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.

Additionally, CIMS sponsors and holds seminars and colloquiums almost daily on weekdays on topics of interest, in which some of whom may be held outside of Warren Weaver Hall. Many speakers of these seminars and colloquiums are experienced researchers from corporations from a variety of industries and researchers from private and government research laboratories, top universities, and NYU. Every academic year, CIMS holds award ceremonies, showcases, and parties to celebrate their faculty and undergraduate and graduate students and keep the academic atmosphere fun and enjoyable at CIMS. One such example is the NYU Computer Science Department Showcase held every semester to showcase projects that have been completed in various computer science graduate and undergraduate courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cims.nyu.edu/events/ |title=NYU &gt; Courant Institute &gt; Weekly Bulletin |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~wincweb/winc.html |title=New York University - Women in Computing |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~csstu/ |title=Courant Student Organization:: New York University |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/math_club/index.html |title=NYU Mathematics Society: Home |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~acmweb/wordpress/ |title=The ACM at NYU |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814133630/http://cs.nyu.edu/~acmweb/wordpress/ |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1934, [[Richard Courant]] left [[Göttingen University]] in Germany to become a visiting professor at NYU. He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed "Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].

The '''Dana/Spicer Model 44''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]] and is used extensively among automobile manufacturers and in the [[automotive aftermarket]] area as well. The Dana 44 was first manufactured in the 1940s and is still being manufactured today, both front and rear axle variants.  The Dana 44 has been manufactured as a [[beam axle]] and [[independent suspension]] for both front and rear axle setups. There are also different variations of the Dana 44. Over a dozen automobile manufacturers have made vehicles that have Dana 44 axles, including [[Jeep]] which currently manufactures [[Four-wheel drive]] vehicles that have both front and rear Dana 44 axles.

==Front Dana 44 solid axle==
The Dana 44 Front axle first saw use in the 1950s and still in use today. Dana 44 Front axles were known for utilizing [[locking hubs]] or a [[center axle disconnect]] system. However, a permanently locked-in Dana 44 is not uncommon. The Dana 44 has seen use in 1/4-, 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton rated trucks. The Dana 44 was manufactured in [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and [[ball joint]] variations, as well as closed and open knuckle variations.

==Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 44 axle==
In the 1960s, Jeep used a unique Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used a form of IFS known as "[[Twin Traction Beam]]" (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but attached to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had "open air" axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints to allow for the independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]] design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized [[locking hubs]]. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.

==Rear Dana 44 solid axle==

===Dana 41===
The Dana 41 was the precursor to the Dana 44 and was used from the 1930s to the 1950s. The ring gear on the Dana 41 is nearly one inch smaller than a Dana 44.

===Dana 44===
The Dana 44 rear axle first saw use in the 1940s and is still in use today. The Dana 44 has a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to {{convert|3500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and is a semi-floating type, having one bearing on the end of the axle shaft which carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle and also allows axle rotation.

There is an 8.9" diameter Dana 44 ring and pinion that is very different from the standard Dana 44. This ring and pinion is significantly stronger with a better pinion to ring gear tooth contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups.  This ring and pinion does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers.  The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.

The Dana Spicer Max momentary output torque FT-lbs
* Low pinion Dana 44 30 spline............3460 [ft/lbs]
* High pinion Dana 44 30 spline...........4170 [ft/lbs]
* Low pinion rear 8.9" Dana 44 32 spline..5340 [ft/lbs]

===Dana 45===
The Dana 45 was introduced during the 1950s as an upgraded Dana 44 with larger 20 spline axle shafts. Since the Dana 45 is no longer being made you can use the Dana 44 gears in the Dana 45 housing if you use model 53 pinion bearings and plenty of shims.

==Independent rear suspension (IRS) Dana 44 axle==
[[File:1963 Jaguar E-Type rear subframe rear view.jpg|thumb|1963 Jaguar E-Type. Dana 44 Rear]]

The Dana 44 has seen use in [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s and [[Dodge Viper]]s. This axle is referred to as a Dana 44 ICA or Dana 44 IRS. All 1980–1982 [[Chevrolet Corvette C3]] and manual transmission equipped 1985–1996 [[Chevrolet Corvette C4]] had this axle. A rear [[transaxle]] was used starting with the [[Corvette C5]]. The 2005–06 Pontiac GTO, The Dodge Viper has always used a Dana 44 IRS setup. The majority of Corvette and Viper Dana 44 IRS set ups use a [[limited slip differential]].

Jaguar first used the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type as well as other models. It was used through 1996 [[Jaguar independent rear suspension|(Jaguar IRS Article)]]. There are some differences in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model through the use of a special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jaguar IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears are slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears are higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear, prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio, there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500&amp;nbsp;hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.

There was a change in design of the Jaguar IRS after 1985. The 61–84 unit is in a stamped steel "cage" that is self-contained and easily removed as a single unit (see photo in this article). This makes it relatively easy to adapt to other vehicles. The 1986 and later unit uses a subframe/lower wishbone design that is not easily adaptable to other vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12808">A concept of '''Design Science''' was introduced in 1957 by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|date=1957|title=A Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnxUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22a+comprehensive+anticipatory+design+science%22&amp;dq=%22a+comprehensive+anticipatory+design+science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi38-C5npDPAhXEMGMKHVbxDsk4HhDoAQgpMAM|journal=Royal Architectural Institute of Canada|volume=34|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-09-14|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defined it as a systematic form of [[design]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bfi.org/design-science/primer/fuller-design-science|title=Fuller on Design Science|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|date=|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this concept in his ''World Design Science Decade'' proposal to the International Union of Architects in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bfi.org/design-science/primer/world-design-science-decade|title=World Design Science Decade documents|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|last2=McHale|first2=John|date=1964|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=Southern Illinois University|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used by S. A. Gregory in the 1965 'The Design Method' Conference &lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt; where he drew the distinction between [[scientific method]] and design method. Gregory was clear in his view that design was not a science and that design science referred to the scientific study of design. [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] in his 1968 [[Karl Taylor Compton]] lectures &lt;ref name="simon1996" /&gt; used and popularized these terms in his argument for the scientific study of the artificial (as opposed to the natural). Over the intervening period the two uses of the term (systematic designing and study of designing) have co-mingled to the point where design science may have both meanings.

==Science of design==

The first edition of Simon's ''The Sciences of the Artificial'',&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1969, built on previous developments and motivated the development of systematic and formalized [[Design methods|design methodologies]] relevant to many design disciplines, for example architecture, engineering, urban planning, medicine, computer science, and management studies.&lt;ref name="baldwin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="banathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="long1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="romme2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanaken2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="warfield1990" /&gt; Simon's ideas about the science of design also motivated the development of [[Design|design research]] and the scientific study of designing.&lt;ref name="cross2007" /&gt; In his book Simon also used the idea of a theory of design alluding to design science as a science of design. For example, the [[Axiomatic design|axiomatic theory of design]] described in Suh&lt;ref name="suh1990" /&gt; presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process. The [[Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology|Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology]], described in Gero&lt;ref name="gero1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gerokanneng2004" /&gt; presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing, is another example. Early efforts that use mathematics to formalize the design process include Braha’s Formal Theory of Design (FDT), which is a domain independent mathematical and computational theory of the design process.&lt;ref name=”FDT”&gt;Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from the idea of a 'design science' there has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science.&lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crossnw1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willem1990" /&gt; [[Nigel Cross]] differentiated between scientific design, design science and a science of design.&lt;ref name="cross2001" /&gt; The scientific study of design does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific and an increasing number of research programs take this view.&lt;ref name="gero2004" /&gt; Cross uses the term 'designerly' to distinguish designing from other kinds of human activity.&lt;ref name="cross2006" /&gt;

==Design as science==

Braha and Maimon argue that there is direct similarity between design and the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_TSMC_Design_Process.pdf The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”FDT”/&gt; There is growing pressure on architects, engineers, lawyers, managers and other design-oriented professionals to act and decide on the basis of a systematic body of evidence.&lt;ref name="vanaken2009" /&gt; Hevner and Chatterjee provide a reference on Design Science Research (DSR) in Information Systems,&lt;ref name="hevner2010" /&gt; including a selection of papers from the [http://desrist.org/ DESRIST conferences], a look at key principles of DSR, and the integration of action research with design research. In 2010, 122 professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a [http://memo.iwi.unisg.ch/en/ memorandum].

==Design as science in information systems==

Hevner et al. provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct, evaluate and present design-science research.&lt;ref name="hevner2004" /&gt;  The seven guidelines address design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contributions, research rigor, design as a search process,  and research communication.

Later extensions of the Design Science framework detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving.&lt;ref name="wieringa2009" /&gt; It is also explained how the regulative cycle (problem investigation, solution design, design validation, solution implementation, and implementation evaluation) fits in the framework. Peffers et al.&lt;ref name="peffers" /&gt; developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research, the Design Science Research Process. The Peffers et al. model has been used extensively and Adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt;

The term '''disease causative agent''' usually refers to the biological [[pathogen]] that causes a disease, such as a [[virus]], [[parasite]], [[fungus]], or [[bacterium]]. Technically, the term can also refer to a [[toxin]] or [[Toxicity|toxic]] chemical that causes illness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14096">'''Disinfection by-products''' (DBPs) result from [[chemical reaction]]s between organic and inorganic matter in water with chemical treatment agents during the [[water disinfection]] process.&lt;ref name=Richardson07&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.09.001 |title=Occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in drinking water: A review and roadmap for research |year=2007 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Plewa |first2=Michael J. |last3=Wagner |first3=Elizabeth D. |last4=Schoeny |first4=Rita |last5=DeMarini |first5=David M. |journal=Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research |volume=636 |pages=178–242 |pmid=17980649 |issue=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chlorination disinfection byproducts ==
Chlorinated [[disinfectant|disinfection agents]] such as [[chlorine]] and [[chloramine]] are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s introduced into water in order to destroy [[pathogenic]] microbes, to oxidize taste/odor-forming compounds, and to form a [[disinfectant residual]] so water can reach the consumer tap safe from microbial contamination. These disinfectants may react with naturally present [[fulvic acid|fulvic]] and [[humic acid|humic]] acids, amino acids, and other natural organic matter, as well as iodide and bromide ions, to produce a range of DBPs such as the [[trihalomethanes]] (THMs), [[haloacetic acids]] (HAAs), [[bromate]], and [[chlorite]] (which are regulated in the US), and so-called "emerging" DBPs such as [[nitromethane|halonitromethanes]], [[acetonitrile|haloacetonitriles]], [[haloamide]]s, [[furanone|halofuranones]], [[iodo-acid]]s such as [[iodoacetic acid]], iodo-THMs ([[iodotrihalomethanes]]), [[nitrosamine]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

Chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the US, and it has been found to produce [[N-Nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA), which is a possible human carcinogen, as well as highly [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] iodinated DBPs, such as [[iodoacetic acid]], when iodide is present in source waters.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/es801169k |title= Occurrence and Mammalian Cell Toxicity of Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in Drinking Water |year=2008 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Fasano |first2=Francesca |last3=Ellington |first3=J.

Residual chlorine and other disinfectants may also react further within the distribution network — both by further reactions with dissolved natural organic matter and with biofilms present in the pipes. In addition to being highly influenced by the types of organic and inorganic matter in the source water, the different species and concentrations of DBPs vary according to the type of disinfectant used, the dose of disinfectant, the concentration of natural organic matter and bromide/iodide, the time since dosing (i.e. water age), temperature, and pH of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=81–90 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.1997.12.2.81 |title=Drinking Water Chlorination By-Products And Cancer |year=1997 |last1=Koivusalo, |first1=Meri |last2=Vartiainen |first2=Terttu |journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |volume=12 |issue=2 |pmid=9273924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming pools using chlorine have been found to contain trihalomethanes, although generally they are below current EU standard for drinking water (100 micrograms per litre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=586–99 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500139 |title=Uptake of chlorination disinfection by-products; a review and a discussion of its implications for exposure assessment in epidemiological studies |year=2000 |last1=Nieuwenhuijsen |first1=Mark J. |last2=Toledano |first2=Mireille B. |last3=Elliott |first3=Paul |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=10 |issue=6 |pmid=11140442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of trihalomethanes (mainly [[chloroform]]) of up to 0.43 ppm have been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beech |first1=J.

Trichloramine is formed by the reaction of urea (from urine and sweat) with chlorine and gives the indoor swimming pool its distinctive odor.

==Byproducts from non-chlorinated disinfectants==
Several powerful oxidizing agents are used in disinfecting and treating drinking water, and many of these also cause the formation of DBPs. [[Ozone]], for example, produces ketones, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes, including formaldehyde.  Bromide in source waters can be converted by ozone into [[bromate]], a potent carcinogen that is regulated in the United States, as well as other brominated DBPs.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt; 

As regulations are tightened on established DBPs such as THMs and HAAs, drinking water treatment plants may switch to alternative disinfection methods. This change will alter the distribution of classes of DBP's.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

==Occurrence==
DBPs are present in most drinking water supplies that have been subject to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[chloramination]], ozonation, or treatment with chlorine dioxide. Many hundreds of DBPs exist in treated drinking water and at least 600 have been identified.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Richardson |first=Susan D. | editor-last =Nriagu | editor-first =J.O. |title=Disinfection By-Products: Formation and Occurrence of Drinking Water |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environmental Health |volume=2 | pages=110–13| publisher=Burlington Elsevier | year=2011 |isbn=978-0-444-52273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low levels of many of these DBPs, coupled with the analytical costs in testing water samples for them, means that in practice only a handful of DBPs are actually monitored. Increasingly it is recognized that the genotoxicities and cytotoxicities of many of the DBPs not subject to regulatory monitoring, (particularly iodinated, nitrogenous DBPs) are comparatively much higher than those DBPs commonly monitored in the developed world (THMs and HAAs).&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=955–61 |doi=10.1021/es071754h |title=Occurrence, Synthesis, and Mammalian Cell Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of Haloacetamides: An Emerging Class of Nitrogenous Drinking Water Disinfection Byproducts |year=2008 |last1=Plewa |first1=Michael J. |last2=Muellner |first2=Mark G. |last3=Richardson |first3=Susan D. |last4=Fasano |first4=Francesca |last5=Buettner |first5=Katherine M. |last6=Woo |first6=Yin-Tak |last7=McKague |first7=A. Bruce |last8=Wagner |first8=Elizabeth D. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=42 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' ''Earth Negotiations Bulletin'' ''' ''('''ENB''')'' is a periodic internet news publication covering negotiations, workshops and conferences on a variety of subjects in environmental policy and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chasek|first1=Pamela S.|title=NGOs and State Capacity in International Environmental Negotiations: The Experience of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin|journal=Review of European Community and International Environmental Law|volume=10|issue=2|year=2001|pages=168–176|issn=0962-8797|doi=10.1111/1467-9388.00273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published daily in print and online forms, and with email, Facebook and Twitter feeds, during [[conference of the parties|conferences of the parties]] to [[multilateral environmental agreement]]s; and is a publication of the Reporting Services division of the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]. The publication and division are based in New York City.

== History ==

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, a small group of environmental journalists published a daily bulletin describing the proceedings. The publication caught the attention of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a sustainability think tank based in Winnipeg, Canada, which proposed that a team be assembled to provide ongoing coverage of follow-up meetings and processes launched in Rio.

== Personnel ==
Bulletins for each workshop or conference are written and edited by a small team of consultants selected from several dozen located around the world, drawn primarily from academia and international affairs.  Many writers join the team while in graduate school and eventually move on to careers in international organizations.  Conversely, retired career diplomats from the United States, Russia and China have also brought their experience to the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/ Current ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/former-enb.html Former ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coverage ==

The ''ENB'' covers a range of topics in sustainability.  Core coverage areas include:

* [[Sustainable Development]], including the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]]
* [[Biodiversity]] and [[Wildlife]], including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], [[Convention on Migratory Species]], and [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] (formerly the [[International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity]])
* Chemicals Management, including the [[Basel Convention]], [[Rotterdam Convention]] and [[Stockholm Convention]]
* [[Climate]] and [[Atmosphere]], including the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and [[Montreal Protocol]]
* [[Forests]], [[Deserts]] and [[Land (disambiguation)|Land]], including the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]], [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] Council, and [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Committee on Forestry
* [[Developmental psychology|Human Development]], including [[UN-HABITAT]]
* [[Organizations]], including the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]
* Trade and Investment, including the [[Global Environment Facility]]
* [[Water]], [[Oceans]] and [[Wetlands]], including the [[World Water Forum]], [[Global Conference on Oceans, Coasts and Islands]], the Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], the [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement]], the Working Group on Marine Biodiversity Beyond Areas of National Jurisdiction, and the [[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].

Reporting teams are also sent to a variety of conferences on sustainability that fall outside the confines of the list above, under agreements with conference organizers.  These conferences include regional negotiations, conferences dealing with sustainability in specific industries such as the [[International Hydropower Association]] World Congress on Sustainable Hydropower, and special-interest days within larger conferences, such as "Business Day" during UN Climate Change conferences.

In [[printmaking]], an '''edition''' is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a ''limited edition'', with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an ''open edition'' limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper.  These may be marketed as "limited editions" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
[[File:Rembrandt House Museum, printing studioDSCF7277.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rembrandt House Museum]], printing studio]]

One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the [[Old master print]] the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books.  Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new [[State (printmaking)|state]]. The art market attempts to distinguish between "lifetime impressions" and "late impressions", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the [[paper]] involved, and its [[watermark]], and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image.  But it remains a difficult area.   
[[File:Goya - Befreit uns niemand von unseren Fesseln ca 1799.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aquatint]] by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]], from the Cycle "[[Los Caprichos]]": Can't Anyone Untie Us?]]
The [[aquatint]]s of [[Goya]], which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, "posthumous editions" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often "cancelled" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a "one-off," meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of "artist's prints" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that "there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes." &lt;ref&gt;Mitzi Humphrey, ''In Search of the Meandering Absolute: The Prints of Mitzi Humphrey''. Thesis (M.F.A.)Department of Painting and Printmaking,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1997. p.1, Abstract, 64 pp. https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-search-of-the-meandering-absolute-the-prints-of-mitzi-humphrey/oclc/41232924&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., "15/30" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In [[monotyping]], a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked "unique". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. 

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. [[Artist's proof]]s are marked "A. P." or "P/A", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked "unique"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked "H. C." or "H/C", meaning "hors de commerce", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs.  The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked "P. P." Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as "bon à tirer" or "BAT" ("good to print" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Terms: Printmaking|url=http://www.artcellarexchange.com/glossary_printmaking.html|publisher=Art Cellar Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several [[artist's proof]] copies, including a "bon a tirer" print and then one unique copy designated as a "[[one-off]]" or "1/1" or "one/off".

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folk plays''' such as [[Hoodening]], [[Guising]], [[Mummers Play]] and [[Soul cake|Soul Caking]] are generally verse sketches performed in countryside pubs in European countries, private houses or the open air, at set times of the year such as the [[winter solstice|Winter]] or Summer [[solstice]]s or Christmas and New Year. Many have long traditions, although they are frequently updated to retain their relevance for modern audiences.

The phenomenon is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House: Wilson calls for action on ‘granny dumping’ {{!}} The Royal Gazette:Bermuda Health|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150310/NEWS06/150319979|website=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practice, known as ''[[ubasute]]'', had allegedly existed in Japan centuries ago when senile elders were brought to mountaintops by poor citizens who were unable to look after them. The widespread economic and demographic problems facing Japan have seen it on the rise with relatives dropping off seniors at hospitals or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese people who can't afford elder care are reviving a practice known as 'granny dumping'|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/japanese-people-reviving-granny-dumping-practice-2017-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 (both male and female equally) elderly Americans were estimated to have been abandoned in 1992 in a report issued by the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]]. In this same study, ACEP received informal surveys from 169 hospital Emergency Departments and report an average of 8 "granny dumping" abandonments per week. According to the New York Times, 1 in 5 people are now caring for an elderly parent and people are spending more time than ever caring for an elderly parent than their own children. Social workers have said that this may be the result of millions of people who are near the breaking point of looking after their elderly parents who are in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Granny Dumping by the Thousands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/opinion/granny-dumping-by-the-thousands.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=29 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, granny dumping is more likely to happen in states such as Florida, Texas and California where there are large populations of retirement communities. Congress has attempted to step in by mandating to emergency departments requiring them to see all patients. However, Medicaid is covering less and less of medical bills through reimbursement (in 1989 it was 78% but that number is decreasing) and reduced eligibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some cases, the hospitals may not want to take the risk of having a patient who cannot pay so they will attempt to transfer their care to another hospital. According to the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] set into place by [[Ronald Reagan]], a hospital can transfer at the patient's request or providers must sign a document providing why they believe a patient's care should be better served at another facility. With 40% of revenue coming from [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] a hospital must earn 8 cents per dollar to compensate for the loss of 7 cents per Medicaid/Medicare patients. Hospitals had to pay an additional 2 billion dollars to private payers to cover costs for Medicare/Medicaid patients in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conard|first=Jane Reister|date=1992|title=Granny Dumping: The Hospital's Duty of Care to Patients Who Have Nowhere to Go|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40239388|journal=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=463–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of granny dumping can happen before long weekends and may peak before Christmas when families head off on holidays. Caregivers in both Australia and New Zealand report that old people without acute medical problems are dropped off at hospitals. As a result, hospitals and care facilities have to carry an extra burden on their limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Holiday concern about 'granny dumping' at hospitals|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11348685|website=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en-NZ|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disturbing rise in cases of 'granny dumping'|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/elderly-being-dumped-by-families-at-hospital/news-story/4642a4958d8ff9edf5160382350a1103|website=News.com.au|publisher=The Sunday Mail, Queensland|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Halotolerance''' is the [[osmoregulation|adaptation]] of living [[organism]]s to conditions of high [[salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Larcher, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Halotolerant species tend to live in areas such as [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[dune|coastal dunes]], saline [[desert]]s, [[salt marsh]]es, and inland salt [[sea]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s. [[Halophile]]s are organisms that live in highly saline environments, and require the [[salinity]] to survive, while halotolerant organisms (belonging to different [[Domain (biology)|domains]] of life) can grow under saline conditions, but do not require elevated concentrations of salt for growth. [[Halophyte]]s are salt-tolerant higher plants. Halotolerant microorganisms are of considerable biotechnological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007920100184 | last1 = Margesin | first1 = R. | last2 = Schinner | first2 = F. | title = Potential of halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms for biotechnology | journal = Extremophiles : Life Under Extreme Conditions | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–83 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11354458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Fields of scientific research relevant to halotolerance include [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology]], [[physiology]], [[ecology]], and [[genetics]].

An understanding of halotolerance can be applicable to areas such as [[arid-zone agriculture]], [[xeriscaping]], [[aquaculture]] (of fish or algae), bioproduction of desirable compounds (such as [[phycobiliprotein]]s or [[carotenoid]]s) using seawater to support growth, or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of salt-affected soils. In addition, many environmental stressors involve or induce osmotic changes, so knowledge gained about halotolerance can also be relevant to understanding tolerance to extremes in moisture or temperature.

Goals of studying halotolerance include increasing the agricultural productivity of lands affected by [[soil salination]] or where only saline water is available. Conventional agricultural species could be made more halotolerant by gene transfer from naturally halotolerant species (by conventional [[Artificial selection|breeding]] or [[genetic engineering]]) or by applying treatments developed from an understanding of the mechanisms of halotolerance. In addition, naturally halotolerant plants or microorganisms could be developed into useful [[agriculture|agricultural]] crops or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] organisms.

==Cellular functions in halophytes==
Tolerance of high salt conditions can be obtained through several routes. High levels of salt entering the plant can trigger ionic imbalances which cause complications in respiration and photosynthesis, leading to reduced rates of growth, injury and death in severe cases. To be considered tolerant of saline conditions, the [[protoplast]] must show methods of balancing the toxic and [[osmotic]] effects of the increased salt concentrations. Halophytic vascular plants can survive on soils with salt concentrations around 6%, or up to 20% in extreme cases. Tolerance of such conditions is reached through the use of [[stress proteins]] and compatible cytoplasm osmotic solutes.&lt;ref name=Gupta-2014&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/2014/701596/| title=Mechanism of Salinity Tolerance in Plants: Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Characterization| first1=Bhaskar| last1=Gupta| first2=Bingru| last2=Huang| journal=[[International Journal of Genomics]]| volume=2014| pages=1–18| doi=10.1155/2014/701596| pmid=24804192| pmc=3996477| date=3 April 2014| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To exist in such conditions, halophytes tend to be subject to the uptake of high levels of salt into their cells, and this is often required to maintain an osmotic potential lower than that of the soil to ensure water uptake. High salt concentrations within the cell can be damaging to sensitive organelles such as the chloroplast, so sequestration of salt is seen. Under this action, salt is stored within the [[vacuole]] to protect such delicate areas. If high salt concentrations are seen within the vacuole, a high concentration gradient will be established between the vacuole and the cytoplasm, leading to high levels of energy investment to maintain this state. Therefore, the accumulation of compatible cytoplasmic osmotic solutes can be seen to prevent this situation from occurring. [[Amino acid]]s such as proline accumulate in halophytic [[Brassica]] species, quaternary ammonium bases such as Glycine Betaine and sugars have been shown to act in this role within halophytic members of [[Chenopodiaceae]] and members of [[Asteraceae]] show the buildup of cyclites and soluble sugars. The buildup of these compounds allow for the balancing of the osmotic effect while preventing the establishment of toxic concentrations of salt or requiring the maintenance of high concentration gradients

==Bacterial halotolerance==
The extent of halotolerance varies widely amongst different species of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Häussinger and Helmut Sies, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[cyanobacteria]] are halotolerant; an example location of occurrence for such cyanobacteria is in the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]], a large [[hypersaline lake]] in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal halotolerance==
[[Fungi]] from habitats with high concentration of salt are mostly halotolerant (i.e. they do not require salt for growth) and not halophilic. Halophilic fungi are a rare exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">[[File:Journal.pgen.1002737.g001.png|thumb|Dynamic chromosome pairing. The term “pairing” describes the spatial juxtaposition of entire homologous chromosomes, allelic sequences, and/or homologous sequences at non-allelic locations. (A, B) Homologous chromosomes can exist as paired throughout their entire length and the relative activities of pairing and anti-pairing factors determine the degree of global chromosome pairing. (C) Local pairing and anti-pairing factors can affect pairing status of specific genes or chromosomal regions. Local “pairing centers” can nucleate global pairing, but it is unclear whether factors regulating local pairing are different from global pairing factors. (D–F) In some cases, centromeres or telomeres from homologs can pair or cluster with non-homologous chromosomes, while there is no pairing along chromosome arms]]

'''[[Somatic (biology)|Somatic]] pairing''' of [[homologous chromosome]]s is similar to pre- and early [[Meiosis|meiotic]] pairing (see article: [[Homologous chromosome#In meiosis]]), and has been observed in [[Diptera]]&lt;ref name="Metz1916"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metz|first1=Charles W.|title=Chromosome studies on the Diptera.

Mammals show little pairing apart from in germline cells, taking place at specific loci, and under the control of developmental signalling (understood as a subset of other long-range interchromosomal interactions such as looping, and organisation into [[Chromosome territories|chromosomal territories]]).&lt;ref name="ApteMeller2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apte|first1=Manasi S.|last2=Meller|first2=Victoria H.|title=Homologue Pairing in Flies and Mammals: Gene Regulation When Two Are Involved|journal=Genetics Research International|volume=2012|year=2012|pages=1–9|issn=2090-3154|doi=10.1155/2012/430587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While meiotic pairing has been extensively studied, the role of somatic pairing has remained less well understood, and even whether it is mechanistically related to meiotic pairing is unknown.&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Copenhaver|first1=Gregory P.|last2=Bosco|first2=Giovanni|title=Chromosome Pairing: A Hidden Treasure No More|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=8|issue=5|year=2012|pages=e1002737|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002737|pmid=22654678|pmc=3359980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The first review of somatic pairing was made by Metz in 1916,&lt;ref name="Metz1916"/&gt; citing the first descriptions of pairing made in 1907&lt;ref name="Stevens07"&gt;Stevens, N. M. (1907) The chromosomes of Drosophila ampelophila. Proc. VII Internat. Zool. Cong&lt;/ref&gt; and 1908 by [[Nettie Stevens|N. M. Stevens]] in germline cells, who noted:&lt;ref name="Stevens1908"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=N. M.|title=A study of the germ cells of certain diptera, with reference to the heterochromosomes and the phenomena of synapsis|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=5|issue=3|year=1908|pages=359–374|issn=0022-104X|doi=10.1002/jez.1400050304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“it may therefore be true that pairing of homologous chromosomes occurs in connection with each mitosis throughout the life history of these insects” (p.215)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stevens noted the potential for communication and a role in heredity.&lt;ref name="Stevens1908"/&gt;

While meiotic homologous pairing subsequently became well studied, somatic pairing remained neglected due to what has been described as "''limitations in cytological tools for measuring pairing and genetic tools for perturbing pairing dynamics''".&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"/&gt;

==Recent findings from high-throughput screening==

In 1998 it was determined that homologous pairing in ''Drosophila'' occurs through independent initiations (as opposed to a directed, 'processive zippering' motion).&lt;ref name="ApteMeller2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungMarshall1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fung|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Marshall|first2=Wallace F.|last3=Dernburg|first3=Abby|last4=Agard|first4=David A.|last5=Sedat|first5=John W.|title=Homologous Chromosome Pairing inDrosophila melanogasterProceeds through Multiple Independent Initiations|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=141|issue=1|year=1998|pages=5–20|issn=0021-9525|doi=10.1083/jcb.141.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[RNAi]] screen (based on [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|DNA FISH]]&lt;ref name="GonzalezMateos-Langerak2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Inma|last2=Mateos-Langerak|first2=Julio|last3=Thomas|first3=Aubin|last4=Cheutin|first4=Thierry|last5=Cavalli|first5=Giacomo|title=Identification of Regulators of the Three-Dimensional Polycomb Organization by a Microscopy-Based Genome-wide RNAi Screen|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=54|issue=3|year=2014|pages=485–499|issn=1097-2765|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.004|pmid=24703951}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was carried out to identify genes regulating [[Drosophila melanogaster|''D. melanogaster'']] somatic pairing in 2012,&lt;ref name="HawleyJoyce2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joyce|first1=Eric F.|last2=Williams|first2=Benjamin R.|last3=Xie|first3=Tiao|last4=Wu|first4=C.-ting|title=Identification of Genes That Promote or Antagonize Somatic Homolog Pairing Using a High-Throughput FISH–Based Screen|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=8|issue=5|year=2012|pages=e1002667|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002667|pmid=22589731|pmc=3349724}}&lt;/ref&gt; described at the time as providing "an extensive “parts list” of mostly novel factors". These comprised 40 pairing promoting genes and 65 'anti-pairing' genes (of which 2 and 1 were already known, respectively), many of which have human [[Orthologous gene|orthologs]].&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"/&gt;

For that purpose they took a simplified two-dimensional nonlinear axi-symmetric potential and found that the third integral existed only for a limited number of initial conditions.
In the modern perspective the initial conditions that do not have the third integral of motion are called chaotic orbits.

:&lt;math&gt;
V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda \left(x^2y - \frac{y^3}{3}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
The Hénon–Heiles [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; H = \frac12 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda \left(x^2y - \frac{y^3}{3}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The Hénon–Heiles system (HHS) is defined by the following four equations:
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = p_x, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{p_x} = -x - 2\lambda xy, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{y} = p_y, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \dot{p_y} = -y - \lambda(x^2 - y^2).&lt;/math&gt;
In the classical chaos community, the value of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is usually taken as unity.   
Since HHS is specified in &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;, we need a Hamiltonian with 2 degrees of freedom to model it.
It can be solved for some cases using [[Painlevé transcendents|Painlevé analysis]].

==Quantum Henon–Heiles Hamiltonian==
In the quantum case the Henon–Heiles [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] can be written as a two-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]].

The corresponding two-dimensional Schrödinger equation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,y) = \left[ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \frac12 (x^2 + y^2 ) + \lambda \left(x^2 y - \frac13 y^3\right) \right] \Psi(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

==Wada property of the exit basins ==
Hénon–Heiles system shows rich dynamical behavior. Usually the [[Wada property]] cannot be seen in the [[Hamiltonian system]], but Hénon–Heiles exit basin shows an interesting Wada property. It can be seen that when the energy is greater than the critical energy, the Hénon–Heiles system has three exit basins. In 2001 [[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|M. A. F. Sanjuán]]  et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wada basins and chaotic invariant sets in the Henon–Heiles system, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066208 (2001) |url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v64/i6/e066208}}&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that in the Hénon–Heiles system the exit basins have the Wada property.

The '''Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)''' was initiated in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers - ASHRAE: "[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/ashraeinsights_201408/ ASHRAE Insights, August 2014]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Lyons Hardcastle, "[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/07/11/indoor-environmental-quality-alliance-formed/ Indoor Environmental Quality Alliance Formed]", Environmental Leader, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Governo Law Firm, "Newly Formed Alliance: Premier Resource for Indoor Environmental Quality", July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to improve the actual, delivered indoor environmental quality in buildings through coordination, education, outreach and advocacy. The alliance works to supply information, guidelines and knowledge on the [[Building science|indoor environmental quality (IEQ)]] in buildings and workplaces,&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/news/41608 International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide occupants in buildings and workplaces with an acceptable indoor environmental quality (([[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), thermal conditions, visual quality, and acoustical quality)) and help promote implementation in practice of knowledge from research on the field.

The group has already begun work to collect and critique IEQ standards and is organising and presenting programmes at the conferences of member organisations&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899131#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 1]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899132#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 2]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]]: "[http://www.aivc.org/news/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-first-sessions-june-2015-ashrae-annual-conference Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance first sessions at the June 2015 ASHRAE Annual conference]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]], "[http://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/36-AIVC-program.pdf 36th AIVC Conference Programme]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The Alliance was officially launched on June 29, 2014 during [[ASHRAE]]’s 2014 Annual Conference in [[Seattle]]; a [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed and the Alliance was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[venticool]]: "[http://venticool.eu/international-societies-form-indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga/ International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance] (IEQ-GA)", 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Bahnfleth, ASHRAE’s 2013-2014 president, appointed an ad-hoc committee to look at ways for industry groups to cooperate and address aspects of indoor environmental quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[https://www.ashrae.org/communities/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga Indoor Environmental Quality--Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners and governmental organisations ==
Founding members of the Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance include organisations that broadly deal with the indoor environments as well as those specialised primarily in [[Indoor Air Quality]](IAQ). 
The Alliance’s current partners include the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]] (AIVC), [[ASHRAE|the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)]] the Air &amp; Waste Management Association (A&amp;WMA), the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA), and the Federation of European Heating and Air-Conditioning Associations ([https://www.rehva.eu/ REHVA]) &lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE, "[https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Communities/Memoranda%20of%20Understanding/IEQ-GA-MOU.pdf Memorandum of Understanding- Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", Retrieved August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. The Alliance is also supported by governmental organisations such as the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE): "[http://www.cibsejournal.com/archive/PDFs/CIBSE-Journal-2014-08.pdf Industry seeks to redress IAQ balance]", CIBSE Journal August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7493">'''Information foraging''' is a theory that applies the ideas from [[optimal foraging theory]] to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use "built-in" foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food.  Importantly, better understanding of human search behaviour can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface.

==History of the theory==

In the 1970s [[optimal foraging theory]] was developed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[ecology|ecologists]] to explain how animals hunt for food. It suggested that the eating habits of animals revolve around maximizing [[energy]] intake over a given amount of time. For every [[predation|predator]], certain prey are worth pursuing, while others would result in a net loss of energy.

In the early 1990s, [[Peter Pirolli]] and [[Stuart Card]] from [[PARC (company)|PARC]] noticed the similarities between users' information searching patterns and animal food foraging strategies.  Working together with [[psychology|psychologists]] to analyse users' actions and the information landscape that they navigated (links, descriptions, and other data), they showed that information seekers use the same strategies as food foragers.

In the late 1990s, [[Ed H. Chi]] worked with Pirolli, Card and others at [[PARC (company)|PARC]] to further develop information scent ideas and algorithms to actually use these concepts in real interactive systems, including the modeling of web user browsing behavior, the inference of information needs from web visit log files, and the use of information scent concepts in reading and browsing interfaces.

==Details of the theory==

"[[Informavore]]s" constantly make decisions on what kind of information to look for, whether to stay at the current site to try to find additional information or whether they should move on to another site, which path or link to follow to the next information site, and when to finally stop the search. Although human cognition is not a result of evolutionary pressure to improve Web use, survival-related traits to respond quickly on partial information and reduce energy expenditures force them to optimise their searching behaviour and, simultaneously, to minimize the thinking required.

===Information scent===
The most important concept in the information foraging theory is ''information scent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As animals rely on scents to indicate the chances of finding prey in current area and guide them to other promising patches, so do humans rely on various cues in the information environment to get similar answers. Human users estimate how much useful information they are likely to get on a given path, and after seeking information compare the actual outcome with their predictions. When the information scent stops getting stronger (i.e., when users no longer expect to find  useful additional information), the users  move to a different information source.

===Information diet===
Some tendencies in the behaviour of web users are easily understood from the information foraging theory standpoint. On the Web, each site is a patch and information is the prey. Leaving a site is easy, but finding good sites has not always been as easy. Advanced search engines have changed this fact by reliably providing relevant links, altering the foraging strategies of the users. When users expect that sites with lots of information are easy to find, they have less incentive to stay in one place. The growing availability of broadband connections may have a similar effect: always-on connections encourage this behavior, short online visits to get specific answers.

===Models===
Attempts have been made to develop computational cognitive models to characterize information foraging behavior on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;

These models assume that users perceive relevance of information based on some measures of information scent, which are usually derived based on statistical techniques that extract semantic relatedness of words from large text databases. Recently these information foraging models have been extended to explain social information behavior &lt;ref&gt;

[[astronomy|Astronomers]] use the term '''intrinsic brightness''' to refer to how bright a star would be without the effects of distance or absorption due to interstellar dust or gas. While a bright distant star's [[apparent magnitude|apparent brightness]] might be less than a nearby dim star, due to the [[inverse square law]] for brightness, astronomers can discuss its intrinsic brightness meaning how bright the stars would be at a common distance. A star's intrinsic brightness is measured by its [[absolute magnitude]].

The '''Jerusalem Bird Observatory''' is an urban [[bird observatory]] in [[Israel]], sited on a 5000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plot in central [[Jerusalem]] between the [[Knesset]] and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=gis/&gt;

== History ==

The Jerusalem Bird Observatory was established in 1994 by the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]]. It was founded by the naturalist  Amir Balaban and theornithologist Gidon Perleman.&lt;ref name=gis&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000079511.htm Gems in Israel: The Jerusalem Bird Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, 50,000 tourists visited the park.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Jerusalem-holds-a-haven-for-birds-505776|title=Jerusalem holds a haven for birds|website=Jpost.com|date=24 September 2017|author=Judy Siegel-Itzkovich|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The Jerusalem Bird Observatory has a strategic location on the [[bird migration]] route between [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]] along the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]]. Every spring and fall, more than 500 million [[bird]]s migrate through Israel. Two-thirds of the species seen in Jerusalem are migratory. 30% of the birds are permanent residents, they do not migrate.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"/&gt; [[Gazelle]]s also populate the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/Top-5-nature-spots-in-Jerusalem|title=Top 5 nature spots in Jerusalem|website=Jpost.com|date=7 February 2012|author=Loren minsky|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The observatory serves as the national [[bird ringing|bird banding]] center.&lt;ref&gt;The Capital's feathered friends., Esteban Alterman, Jerusalem Post, Nov. 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It is directed by naturalist Amir Balaban and ornithologist Gidon Perleman.&lt;ref name=gis/&gt; Two hundred birds are banded every day by trained [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s during the spring and fall migrations.

It is located between the Parliament, the [[Wohl Rose Park]] and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] building. Small wooden observation posts are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"/&gt; The park is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.israel21c.org/top-18-things-to-do-in-jerusalem-for-free/|title=Top 18 things to do in Jerusalem for FREE|website=Israel21c.org|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Ardrey| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Ardrey
| title = African Genesis: A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man
| year = 1961 | publisher = [[Atheneum Books]]| location = New York
| isbn = 978-0-00-211014-3 | oclc = 556678068 | lccn = 61015889

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Lorenz | first = Konrad | authorlink = Konrad Lorenz
| title = On Aggression

| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

'''LUX''' or '''Phytoclock1 (PCL1)''' is a [[gene]] that codes for LUX ARRHYTHMO, a protein necessary for [[circadian rhythm]]s in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. LUX protein associates with Early Flowering 3 (ELF3) and Early Flowering 4 (ELF4) to form the Evening Complex (EC), a core component of the ''Arabidopsis'' [[repressilator]] model of the plant [[circadian clock]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Troncoso-Ponce MA, Mas P | title = Newly described components and regulatory mechanisms of circadian clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = Molecular Plant | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 545–53 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22230762 | doi = 10.1093/mp/ssr117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LUX protein functions as a [[transcription factor]] that negatively regulates ''Pseudo-Response Regulator 9'' (''PRR9''), a core gene of the Midday Complex, another component of the ''Arabidopsis'' repressilator model.

== Structure ==
The ''LUX'' gene is located on the third [[chromosome]] of ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and contains three [[exon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/823817|title=PCL1 Homeodomain-like superfamily protein [Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)] - Gene - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upstream of the ''LUX'' gene is a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] containing a [[Cis-regulatory element|''cis-''regulatory element]] known as the "evening element" (EE) with the sequence AAAATATCT. It is overrepresented in evening-expressed genes in the Arabidopsis repressilator. The EE may be bound by [[Circadian Clock Associated 1]] (CCA1) and [[Late Elongated Hypocotyl]] (LHY) proteins to suppress expression of ''LUX''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The LUX ARRHYTHMO protein has a length of 323 amino acids and contains a [[MYB (gene)|Myb]]-like GARP family transcription factor [[DNA-binding domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9SNB4|title=LUX - Transcription factor LUX - Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) - LUX gene &amp; protein|website=www.uniprot.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Function ==
=== Circadian oscillator ===

The LUX ARRHYTHMO protein encoded by the ''LUX'' gene participates in the regulation of the ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' circadian clock. Along with ELF3 and ELF4, it is a member of the Evening Complex, a component of the Arabidopsis repressilator model of [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]]. This three-[[Multiprotein complex|protein complex]] is expressed and assembled during the evening to repress transcription of the ''PRR9'' gene, which codes for a component of the Midday Complex. LUX likely represses ''PRR9'' via direct binding to a DNA sequence that has not yet been elucidated. PRR9 protein subsequently represses ''CCA1'' and ''LHY'', genes which express components of the Morning Complex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although ''LUX'' and ''ELF4'' are induced by low intensity, non-damaging [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-B radiation, the direct molecular mechanism of light input into the ''Arabidopsis'' circadian clock has yet to be elucidated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, as a part of the ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' repressilator, the ''LUX'' gene also represses its own transcription.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''Arabidopsis thaliana'' growth and flowering===

The EC binds to promoters of ''Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4'' (''PIF4'') and ''Phytochrome Interacting Factor 5'' (''PIF5''), repressing their expression and subsequently inhibiting plant growth in the evening. PIF4 and PIF5 proteins are both [[Basic helix-loop-helix|basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain]] transcription factors that are implicated in the induction of ''Flowering Locus T'' (''FT''), which expresses a [[florigen]] involved in promoting ''A. thaliana'' flowering. Mutants lacking functional ''LUX'' are unable to repress ''PIF4'' and ''PIF5'', leading to early accumulation of PIF4 and PIF5 transcription factors and thus premature growth; consequently, ''LUX'' mutants often express an elongated hypocotyl phenotype due to excess growth during the night.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nusinow DA, Helfer A, Hamilton EE, King JJ, Imaizumi T, Schultz TF, Farré EM, Kay SA | title = The ELF4-ELF3-LUX complex links the circadian clock to diurnal control of hypocotyl growth | journal = Nature | volume = 475 | issue = 7356 | pages = 398–402 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21753751 | pmc = 3155984 | doi = 10.1038/nature10182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature input===
 
The EC also plays a role in the detection and response to temperature. Despite variations in temperature which would normally reduce the expression of ''GI'' (''GIGANTEA''), ''LUX'', ''PIF4'', ''PRR7'', and ''PRR9,'' these genes showed constitutively high expression in ''LUX'' (as well as ''ELF3'' and ''ELF4'') mutants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This suggested that ''LUX'' mutants abolished the temperature-responsiveness of those clock genes. In addition, ELF3 association to LUX was found to be abolished at high temperatures, suggesting that temperature may play a role in recruiting EC components to their targeted promoters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Homologs==

=== Paralogs ===
[[Sequence homology#Paralogy|Paralogs]] of LUX have been found to act in conjunction with LUX in Arabidopsis circadian clock regulation pathways.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''NOX''/''BOA'' ====
In the absence of LUX, ELF3 and ELF4 have also been found to form a complex with LUX paralog NOX (meaning “night” in Latin), also called BROTHER OF LUX ARRHYTHMO (BOA). NOX is a homologous Myb-like GARP transcription factor that binds to DNA sequences similar to LUX's binding, interacts directly with ELF4, and peaks in the late evening.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Experiments involving artificial [[microRNA]] (amiRNA) methods have shown that both NOX and LUX are required to recruit the EC to the ''PIF4'' and ''PIF5'' promoters. There is evidence for NOX having an important role in the regulation of the plant circadian oscillator; overexpression of NOX has been found to have circadian phenotypes of long periods, as well as altered expressions of ''CCA1'', ''LHY'', ''GI'', and [[TOC1 (gene)|''TOC1'']]. In particular, overexpression of NOX showed increased amplitudes of ''CCA1'' expression. NOX likely regulates ''CCA1'' through direct binding to the ''CCA1'' promoter, and, conversely, CCA1 protein has been found to bind to the ''NOX'' promoter and inhibit ''NOX'' expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In contrast to ''LUX'', amiRNA [[Gene knockout|knockouts]] of ''NOX'' have shown that NOX is not required for circadian rhythms, suggesting that the functionality of LUX and NOX are not completely redundant. [[RNA interference|RNAi]] experiments reducing ''NOX'' expression showed a continuation of circadian rhythms, whereas ''LUX'' [[Null allele|null mutants]] are arrhythmic. Currently, more research must be done to determine how LUX and NOX differ in their contributions to the EC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Orthologs ===
Specific studies of ''LUX'' (and ''ELF3'') [[Sequence homology#Orthology|orthologous]] mutant [[allele]]s have identified variants in flowering and [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]]-dependent growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''STERILE NODES'' ====
An ortholog for ''LUX'' named ''STERILE NODES (SN)'' was discovered in ''[[Pea|Pisum sativum]]''. The name STERILE NODES came from the observation that photoperiod-responsive ''P. sativum'' lines formed more [[Plant stem|vegetative nodes]] before flowering compared to less photoperiod-responsive lines. The relationship of ''LUX'' and ''SN'' as orthologs was concluded based on the discovery of functionally and phenotypically similar mutations in ''SN'' and ''LUX'', as well as apparent causal linkages between specific [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] and ''SN'' mutant phenotypes. Like ''LUX'', ''SN'' was found to be a major gene locus that controls regulation of circadian clock function and photoperiod-sensitive flowering. Also similar to LUX, SN protein is expressed rhythmically when exposed to light-dark cycles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liew LC, Hecht V, Sussmilch FC, Weller JL | title = The Pea Photoperiod Response Gene STERILE NODES Is an Ortholog of LUX ARRHYTHMO | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 165 | issue = 2 | pages = 648–657 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24706549 | pmc = 4044833 | doi = 10.1104/pp.114.237008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene loci orthologous to ''Arabidopsis'' ''ELF3'', ''ELF4'', and ''GI'' have also been found in ''P. sativum'', named ''HIGH RESPONSE TO PHOTOPERIOD'' (''HR''), ''DIE NEUTRALIS'' (''DNE''), and ''LATE BLOOMER1'' (''LATE1'') respectively. However, they have not yet been discovered to form a functional complex equivalent to the EC in ''Arabidopsis''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== ''HvLUX1'' ====
''HvLUX1'' in ''[[Barley|Hordeum vulgare]]'' has been identified as an ortholog of ''LUX''. The experiment leading to the discovery of ''HvLUX1'' involved a mutation in the ''early maturity 10 ''(''eam10'') locus in the ''H. vulgare'' genome. The mutation, called Bowman(''eam10''), abolished the circadian rhythm observed in ''H. vulgare'' flowering. Via [[DNA sequencing|high throughput sequencing]], ''HvLUX1'' has been identified as a [[candidate gene]] for this locus, though its specific mechanism of action in the circadian clock has yet to be demonstrated.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campoli C, Pankin A, Drosse B, Casao CM, Davis SJ, von Korff M | title = HvLUX1 is a candidate gene underlying the early maturity 10 locus in barley: phylogeny, diversity, and interactions with the circadian clock and photoperiodic pathways | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 199 | issue = 4 | pages = 1045–59 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23731278 | pmc = 3902989 | doi = 10.1111/nph.12346 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12346/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene loci homologous to ''A. thaliana PRR'' genes (''PRR7'' and ''PRR9''), ''ELF3'' and ''FT'' have also been found in ''H. vulgare'', named ''PHOTOPERIOD 1'' (''Ppd-H1''), ''HvELF3'', and ''HvFT1'', respectively.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== ''ROC15'' and ''ROC75'' ====
[[Orthologs]] have been found for all three members of the ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' Evening Complex, but it is currently unknown if the EC is formed in species other than ''A. thaliana''. Two orthologs of ''LUX'', ''ROC15'' and ''ROC75'', have been discovered in ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]],'' but orthologs of ''ELF3'' and ''ELF4'' in ''C. reinhardtii'' have not yet been found.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang H, Nusinow DA | title = Into the Evening: Complex Interactions in the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 674–686 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27594171 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136228">This is a list of [[molecule]]s that have been detected in the [[interstellar medium]] and [[circumstellar envelope]]s, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. The [[chemical formula]] is listed for each detected compound, along with any ionized form that has also been observed.

==Detection==
The molecules listed below were detected by [[spectroscopy]]. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component [[electron]]s between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in [[radio]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=shu82/&gt;

Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often as the result of an interaction with a [[cosmic ray]]. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name=pnas103d/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name=brown_pais95/&gt;

===History===
The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the [[Universe]] was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |arxiv=1312.0613|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first carbon-containing molecule detected in the interstellar medium was the [[methylidyne radical]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1937.&lt;ref name=woon05/&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of more complex organic molecules (COMs),&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fred Hoyle]] and Chandra Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175&amp;nbsp;Å,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200Å interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.

In 2004, scientists reported&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S.|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; detecting the [[spectral signature]]s of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] in the [[ultraviolet light]] emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|date=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537–549|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt; that since they discovered [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2010, [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]") were detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39|title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae|last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

In October 2011, scientists found using [[spectroscopy]] that [[cosmic dust]] contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow|first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars|url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwok|first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/nature10542 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K|pmid=22031328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of [[coal]] and [[petroleum]]; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;  These observations suggest that organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles could serve as basic ingredients for life due to their [[catalysis|surface-catalytic]] activities.&lt;ref name=Lincei&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gallori |first=Enzo |title=Astrochemistry and the origin of genetic material |journal=Rendiconti Lincei |date=November 2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=113–118 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x332837483630g24/ |accessdate=2011-08-11 |doi=10.1007/s12210-011-0118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Zita |title=Organic Chemistry of Carbonaceous Meteorites |journal=Elements |date =February 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=35–40|id=|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/1/35 |accessdate=2011-08-11|doi=10.2113/gselements.7.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;

In August 2012, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/|accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that PAHs, subjected to [[interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[oxygenate|oxygenation]], and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[organic compound|organics]] — "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gudipati|first1=Murthy S.|last2=Yang|first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24|date=September 1, 2012|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]|volume=756|number=1|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012|bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G|pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/351444/description/Interstellar_chemistry_makes_use_of_quantum_shortcut#comment_351468 Interstellar chemistry makes use of quantum shortcut | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at a significantly higher than expected rate, between cold (around 63 [[kelvin]]s) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which would have to be overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.

A particularly large and rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is [[Sagittarius B2]] (Sgr B2). This giant [[molecular cloud]] lies near the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature.&lt;ref name=ajss60/&gt; A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star [[CW Leonis]] (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.&lt;ref name=kaler2002/&gt;

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of [[life]]&amp;mdash;the [[Carbon-hydrogen bond|carbon-hydrogen molecule]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[methylidyne radical]]), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation) and the carbon ion (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation)&amp;mdash;are the result, in large part, of [[ultraviolet light]] from [[star]]s, rather than in other ways, such as the result of turbulent events related to [[supernovae]] and [[young star]]s, as thought earlier.&lt;ref name="NASA-20161012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=Building Blocks of Life's Building Blocks Come From Starlight |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6645 |date=12 October 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/15|bibcode=2016ApJ...829...15M|title=Herschel/HIFI Spectral Mapping of C+, CH+, and CH in Orion BN/Kl: The Prevailing Role of Ultraviolet Irradiation in CH+ Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=829|pages=15|year=2016|last1=Morris|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Gupta|first2=Harshal|last3=Nagy|first3=Zsofia|last4=Pearson|first4=John C.|last5=Ossenkopf-Okada|first5=Volker|last6=Falgarone|first6=Edith|last7=Lis|first7=Dariusz C.|last8=Gerin|first8=Maryvonne|last9=Melnick|first9=Gary|last10=Neufeld|first10=David A.|last11=Bergin|first11=Edwin A.|arxiv = 1604.05805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical models==
To explain the observed ratios of isomeric compounds, the minimum energy principle has been used. In the majority of cases, it explains that some organic entities have greater abundance than their isomers due to the lower total energies of the first one. However, a few exceptions where the principle fails are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattelais|first1=M.|last2=Pauzat|first2=F.|last3=Ellinger|first3=Y.|last4=Ceccarelli|first4=C.|title=Interstellar Complex Organic Molecules and the Minimum Energy Principle|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2009|volume=696|issue=2|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/L133|bibcode=2009ApJ...696L.133L|pages=L133–L136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach ignores energy and deals only with the molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into the range of the values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabirov|first1=Denis|title=Information entropy of interstellar and circumstellar carbon-containing molecules: Molecular size against structural complexity|journal=Computational and Theoretical Chemistry|date=1 December 2016|volume=1097|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1016/j.comptc.2016.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecules==
The following tables list molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. If there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. For molecules where no designation was given in the scientific literature, that field is left empty. Mass is given in [[atomic mass unit]]s. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is listed in parentheses in each section header.

Most of the molecules detected so far are [[organic molecule|organic]]. Only one inorganic species has been observed in molecules which contain at least five atoms, SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt; Larger molecules have so far all had at least one carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3840">In [[engineering]], a '''longeron''' is a load-bearing component of a framework.  The term is commonly used in connection with [[aircraft fuselage]]s and [[automobile]] [[chassis]].  Longerons are used in conjunction with '''stringers''' to form structural frameworks.&lt;ref name=longeron&gt;{{cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Longerons|title=Longeron|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stearman stringer small.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a Boeing/Stearman PT-17 showing small channel section stringers.]]

== Aircraft ==

In aircraft fuselage, stringers are attached to [[former]]s (also called frames)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=V|first=Vignesh|title=Reconnaisance aircraft design project|url=https://www.academia.edu/35242413/Reconnaisance_aircraft_design_project|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and run in the longitudinal direction of the aircraft. They are primarily responsible for transferring the aerodynamic loads acting on the skin onto the frames and formers.  In the wings or horizontal stabilizer, longerons run spanwise (from wing root to wing tip) and attach between the [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]]. The primary function here also is to transfer the bending loads acting on the wings onto the ribs and spar.

Sometimes the terms "longeron" and "stringer" are used interchangeably. Historically, though, there is a subtle difference between the two terms. If the longitudinal members in a fuselage are few in number and run all along the fuselage length (usually 4 to 8), then they are called "longerons". The longeron system also requires that the fuselage frames be closely spaced (about every {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}}). If the longitudinal members are numerous (usually 50 to 100) and are placed just between two formers/frames, then they are called "stringers". In the stringer system the longitudinal members are smaller and the frames are spaced farther apart (about {{convert|15|to|20|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Generally, longerons are of larger cross-section when compared to stringers. On large modern aircraft the stringer system is more common because it is more weight-efficient, despite being more complex to construct and analyze. Some aircraft use a combination of both stringers and longerons.&lt;ref&gt;Bruhn, E.F., page C11.29, "Analysis and Design of Flight Vehicle Structures", 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Longerons often carry larger loads than stringers and also help to transfer skin loads to internal structure. Longerons nearly always attach to frames or [[rib (aircraft)|ribs]]. Stringers often are not attached to anything but the [[stressed skin|skin]], where they carry a portion of the fuselage bending moment through axial loading.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Y. Niu (1988). ''Airframe Structural Design''. Conmilit Press LTD. pp. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not uncommon to have a mixture of longerons and stringers in the same major structural component.

Stringers are also used in the construction of some [[launch vehicle]] [[propellant]] tanks.  For example, the [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Falcon 9]]&lt;!-- the sxFpug20151021 source is specific to the newer (late 2015 and after) version of the Falcon 9 vehicle; I would imagine, but don't have a source, that earlier F9s did the same and used stringers as well. --&gt; launch vehicle uses stringers in the [[RP-1|Kerosene (RP-1)]] tanks, but not in the [[Liquid Oxygen]] tanks, on both the first and second stages.&lt;ref name=sxf9pug20151021&gt;

'''''Love for Sale: Pop Music in America''''' is a 2016 book by ''[[The Nation]]'' music critic David Hajdu, in which he chronicles the 100-plus year history of pop music in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2016/10/15/498056629/-love-for-sale-a-history-of-pop-music-that-s-as-personal-as-it-gets | title = 'Love For Sale': A History Of Pop Music That's As Personal As It Gets | date= October 15, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''NPR'' | author = Scott Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features previously published material as well as interviews, including an interview with legendary [[folk singer]] [[Dave Van Ronk]].&lt;ref name="BuffaloReveiw"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://buffalonews.com/2016/10/22/editors-choice-love-sale-pop-music-america-david-hajdu/ | title = Editor's Choice: Love for Sale: Pop Music in America by David Hajdu | date= October 22, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Buffalo News'' | author = Jeff Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically, ''Love for Sale'' takes the reader from the origins of  [[ragtime]] in the 19th century through to the present era of [[Streaming media|streaming]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freebeacon.com/culture/one-book-music-lovers-read/ | title = The One Book Music Lovers Have to Read | date= January 8, 2017 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Washington Free Beacon'' | author = Matthew Walther }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also sequential discusses the rise of tapes, CDs, and MP3s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.columbia.edu/reviews/fall-2016/%e2%80%9clove-sale-pop-music-america%e2%80%9d | title = 'Love for Sale: Pop Music in America' | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Columbia Magazine'' | author = Eric Liebetrau }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book is derived from the 1930 [[Cole Porter]] [[Love for Sale (song)|song of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/how-strange-the-change-on-david-hajdus-history-of-american-pop-music/ | title = How Strange the Change: On David Hajdu’s History of American Pop Music | date= October 16, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Los Angeles Review of Books'' | author = Dylan Hicks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love for Sale'' constitutes Hajdu's attempt to answer the question: “What is the history and meaning of pop music?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/love-sale-pop-music-america | title = 'Love for Sale: Pop Music in America' | date= October 19, 2016 | accessdate = January 31, 2017 | publisher = ''Commonwealth Magazine'' | author = James Mcfetridge Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the book a generally favorable review, calling it, "very educational and entertaining".

'''Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager''' ('''LUCI''') is a small planned telescope that would be landed on the [[Moon]] to scan the sky in [[near UV]] wavelengths. It is a technology demonstrator developed by the [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-based-startup-aims-for-the-skies-2007606|title=Bangalore-based startup aims for the skies {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=3 August 2014|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014'&gt;"Prospect for UV observations from the Moon".

==Science objectives==

The science objectives of LUCI telescope are primarily to search for transient astronomic events such as [[supernova]]e, [[nova]]e, tidal disruption events by massive [[black hole]]s, and more exotic energetic sources such as [[superluminous supernova]]e and flashes from cosmic collisions which can be very energetic on all scales.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt;&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'&gt; [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3266.pdf Prospect for UV observations from the Moon]. Margarita Safonova, Joice Mathew, Rekhesh Mohan, A. G. Sreejith, Jayant Murthy, Noah Brosch, Norbert Kappelmann, Arpit Sharma and Rahul Narayan. ''ArXive'' 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

LUCI would also look for faint [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s in the [[Solar System]], especially for [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO) and [[potentially hazardous object]]s.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; The aims are focused on UV sources not accessible by the more sensitive large space missions.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; 

==Overview==

The Earth's atmosphere absorbs and scatters UV photons, preventing observations of the active Universe. Placing a telescope on the surface of the Moon is advantageous because of its absence of atmosphere and ionosphere offers an unobstructed view of the space in all wavelengths. The Moon surface provides not just a stable platform, but an inexpensive and long-term access to observations in wavelengths not normally used by large orbital telescope missions. The only UV astronomical observations from the Moon to date were made by [[Apollo 16]] team in 1972.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; LUCI project started in 2013 and is funded by the India department of science and technology.&lt;ref name='B Mirror'/&gt; The telescope team is headed by Jayant Murthy.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-based-startup-aims-for-the-skies-2007606|title=Bangalore-based startup aims for the skies {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=3 August 2014|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===

LUCI is a small technology demonstrator without 3-axis pointing freedom, so it will rely on the motion of the lunar sky.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The optical system is a two-spherical mirror configuration and a double-pass corrector lens. Its primary lens is all-spherical measuring 30 cm&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; transmitting light through the system to a photon-counting [[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) detector which is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths.&lt;ref name='Sarpotdar 2016'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07392.pdf A generic FPGA-based detector readout and real-time image processing board]. Mayuresh Sarpotdar, Joice Mathew, Margarita Safonova and Jayant Murthy. [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]], Bangalore, India. ''ArXive''. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; The detector is an 8 mm UV-sensitive CCD with the response between 200 - 900 nm, so the engineers placed a solar blind filter before the CCD to restrict the bandpass to 200 - 320 nm.&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; 

LUCI is planned to be mostly contained within the lander, and it will be lowered back into its storage bay during the cold lunar nights.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The baseline for LUCI's operation is "a few months".&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt;

'''MS 0735.6+7421''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] located in the [[constellation]] [[Camelopardalis]], approximately 2.6 billion light-years away. It is notable as the location of one of the [[List of most massive black holes|largest central galactic black holes]] in the known universe, which has also apparently produced the most powerful [[active galactic nucleus]] eruption ever discovered since the [[Big Bang]].

Using data from the [[Chandra Space Telescope]], scientists have deduced that an eruption has been occurring for the last 100 million years at the heart of the galaxy cluster, releasing as much energy over this time as hundreds of millions of [[gamma ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050106091317.htm Most Powerful Eruption In The Universe Discovered] NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (ScienceDaily) January 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (The amount of energy released in a year is thus equivalent to several GRBs.) The remnants of the eruption are seen as two cavities on either side of a large central galaxy. If this outburst, with a total energy budget of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; [[joules|J]], was caused by a [[black hole]] accretion event, it must have consumed nearly 600 million solar masses. Work done by Brian McNamara et al. (2008) point out the striking possibility that the outburst was not the result of an accretion event, but was instead powered by the rotation of the black hole. Moreover, the scientists mentioned the possibility that the central black hole in MS 0735.6+7421 could be one of the [[List of most massive black holes|biggest black holes]] inhabiting the visible universe. This speculation is supported by the fact that the central cD Galaxy inside MS 0735.6+7421 possess the largest break radius known, as of today. With a calculated light deficit of more than 20 billion solar luminosities and an assumed light-to-mass ratio of 3, this yields a central black hole mass much above 10 billion solar masses, as far as the break radius was caused by the merger of several black holes in the past. In combination with the gargantuan energy outburst it is therefore very likely that MS 0735.6+7421 hosts a supermassive black hole in its core.
The cluster has a red shift of 64,800 ± 900&amp;nbsp;km/[[second|s]] and an apparent size of 25&amp;prime;.&lt;ref&gt;

The failure or fracture of a product or component as a result of a single event is known as '''mechanical overload'''. It is a common [[failure mode]], and may be contrasted with [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[rupture (engineering)|rupture]], or [[stress relaxation]]. The terms are used in [[forensic engineering]] and [[structural engineering]] when analysing product failure. Failure may occur because either the product is weaker than expected owing to a [[stress concentration]], or the applied load is greater than expected and exceeds the normal [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]] or [[compressive strength]] of the product.

==Examples==
{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}

Examples include the many components which fail in [[car crash]]es, [[train crash]]es, and [[airplane crash]]es as a result of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] loading. The problem for the investigator is to determine which failures have been caused by the crash, and which may have caused the crash. It usually involves examining the broken parts for signs of [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack growth or other damage to the part which cannot be attributed to the crash itself. For very large [[structural failure]]s such as the collapse of bridges, it is necessarily a long and tedious process of sifting through the broken parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Memory work''' is a process of engaging with the past which has both an [[ethical]] and [[historical]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; [[Edgar Reitz|Edgar Reitz's]] ''[[Heimat (film series)|Heimat]]'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and memory==
The premise for memory work or ''travail de memoire'' is that history is not memory. We try to represent the past in the present through memory, history and the archives. As [[Paul Ricoeur]] argued, memory alone is fallible.&lt;ref&gt;(1955) Ricoeur, Paul. ''History and Truth''. Translated by C. A. Kelbley. Evanston: Northwestern University press. (2nd edition 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare, uninterpreted facts.  [[Historian]]s construct and use archives that contain traces of the past. However, historians and [[librarian]]s determine which traces are preserved and stored. This is an interpretive activity. Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to “facts that can be asserted in singular, discrete propositions that usually include dates, places, proper names, and verbs of action or condition”.&lt;ref&gt;(2000) Ricoeur, Paul. La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli: l'ordre philosophique: Éditions du Seuil, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective. Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed. Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped. A group's communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond, a sense of belonging and identity. Professional historians attempt to corroborate, correct, or refute collective memory. Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of at-risk groups.

The concept of memory-work as distinguished from history-as-memory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) Rousso, Henry. ''The Vichy Syndrome: History and Memory in France since 1944''. Translated by A. Goldhammer. Cambridge/London: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His title uses medical lexicon to refer to history-memory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history. This calls for an expanded archive that includes the "oral and popular tradition"&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives.

==Pierre Nora on memory work==
[[Pierre Nora]], introduced 'lieu de mémoire' about 25 years ago, he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nation-state to the revisiting of distorted histories of the [[anti-Semitic]] [[Vichy regime|Vichy France]] (1940-1944) following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Nora, Pierre. "The Reasons for the Current Upsurge in Memory." Transit-Virtuelles Forum.22 Retrieved Access 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974. Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]’s ''[[Gulag Archipelago]]'' which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past. 'Lieu de mémoire' closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory, instead of opening up perspectives. He associated memory with place, and location.

During memory work, the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary, is central. Therefore, the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;*(2008), Haug, Frigga. "Australian Feminist Studies" in Memory Work. Volume 23, 537-541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacques Derrida on memory work==
After meeting at Yale University in 1966, Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of [[Paul de Man]]'s&lt;ref name="NYT1dec1987"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper|publisher=New York Timesdate=1 December 1987|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19871201&amp;id=QkNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,1648630}}page 1&lt;/ref&gt; until de Man's death in 1983. In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures, including one at Yale University on the art of memory. In ''Memories:for Paul de Man'' {{harv|Derrida|1986}} described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this often-cited passage.

{{quote|"The very condition of a deconstruction may be at work in the work, within the system to be deconstructed. It may already be located there, already at work. Not at the center, but in an eccentric center, in a corner whose eccentricity assures the solid concentration of the system, participating in the construction of what it, at the same time, threatens to deconstruct. One might then be inclined to reach this conclusion: deconstruction is not an operation that supervenes afterwards, from the outside, one fine day. It is always already at work in the work. Since the destructive force of Deconstruction is always already contained within the very architecture of the work, all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct, given this always already, is to do memory work. Yet since I want neither to accept nor to reject a conclusion formulated in precisely these terms, let us leave this question suspended for the moment."{{harv|Derrida|1986|p=71}}&lt;ref name="Derrida1986"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Derrida|title=Memories:for Paul de Man|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Barbara Gabriel on memory work==
[[Barbara Gabriel]] provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating ''[[wikt:unheimlich|unheimlich]]'' within the ''[[wikt:heimlich|heimlich]]'', in a [[Freudian]] 'one within the other structure'.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's ''Heimat'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As point of departure Gabriel examined [[Edgar Reitz]]'s eleven-part West German television series entitled [[Heimat (film series)|''Heimat'']]. Reitz' work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the ''Holocaust'' followed viewed by millions. As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s, artists like [[Günter Grass]] and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided, post-Holocaust Germany. Gabriel developed  the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost, far away, nostalgic place, a utopic homeland. "How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be, whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers?"&lt;ref&gt;(1982) Kristeva, Julia. ''Powers of Horror.'' New York: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that which we fear as 'other' is within ourselves through our shared humanity. Repressed memories haunt all of us.

==Artistic and Activist Memory Work==

After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town, South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas, Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward, created a performance piece called ''Site'' in Melbourne Watch House in 2006. She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street, Cape Town, South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization, the largest of its kind in the South Africa.&lt;ref name=activist_memory_work&gt;

==Post-colonial views==
The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a post-national point of view. Expanding on [[Norbert Loeffler]]: The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question, not as an answer.

Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons. Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the [[Pied-noir]], or French colonials in Algeria, who returned to [[France]] following the [[Algerian War]]. Examples of such thinkers include [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Hélène Cixous]]. Another major writer in this field, [[Julia Kristeva]], also moved away from the country of her birth, having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24.

The missionary position may involve [[sexual penetration]] or [[non-penetrative sex]] (for example, [[intercrural sex]]), and its penile-vaginal aspect is an example of ventro-ventral (front-to-front) [[Reproduction|reproductive]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dixson |first=Alan F. |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r56ov450wbEC&amp;dq=dorso-ventral+copulation&amp;q=page+113#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary&amp;f=false |title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings |publisher= ([[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford, England| page=113 |isbn= 978-0-19-850182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the position allow varying degrees of [[Clitoris|clitoral stimulation]], depth of penetration, participation on the part of the woman, and the likelihood and speed of [[orgasm]].

It is commonly believed that the term ''missionary position'' arose in connection with English-speaking [[Christian]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missionaries]], who supposedly encouraged the sexual position in new [[conversion to Christianity|converts]] in the [[History of colonialism|colonial era]].&lt;ref name="RobertsPadgett-Yawn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Amanda|last2=Padgett-Yawn|first2=Barbara|title=Reader's Digest Guide to Love &amp; Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY_15m_TKdAC|accessdate=27 July 2015|year=1998|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|isbn=9780762100439|quote=The missionary position is so called because it was allegedly the sexual position recommended by Christian missionaries to their Polynesian converts in the era of European colonialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term probably originated from [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' through a confluence of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of historical documents.&lt;ref name="Cecil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/050617.html |title=Assuming the missionary position… again |date=2005-06-17 |work=The [[Straight Dope]] |publisher=[[Cecil Adams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14992209"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Priest |first=Robert J. |title=Missionary Positions: Christian, Modernist, and Postmodernist |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2001 |doi=10.1086/318433 |pages=29–68 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |pmid=14992209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French refer to it as the 'classical' position.

''Human Sexuality, Ethnoculture, and Social Work''. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the [[romance (love)|romantic aspects]] of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction.&lt;ref name="shr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/sex_positions/missionary_position.html |title=Sex Position – Missionary / The Man-on-Top Position |publisher=sexual-health-resource.org |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511214239/http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/sex_positions/missionary_position.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of [[pelvic thrusting]]. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs. The position is less suitable for late stages of [[pregnancy]], or when it is desired for the woman to have greater control over rhythm and depth of penetration.

==Etymology and other usage==
Before the release of Alfred Kinsey's work, the missionary position was known by several names, including ''the matrimonial'', ''the Mama-Papa position'', ''the English-American position'', and ''the male superior position''.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"&gt;Priest, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Kinsey published the male volume of the [[Kinsey Reports]], ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''. He described the American preference for the position and called it ''the English-American position''. Discussing [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski's]] ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia'', Kinsey wrote, "It will be recalled that Malinowski (1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different position among the [[Trobrianders]] ... [and] ... that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around ... campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'"&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt; To date, lexicographers and sexologists have not found use of the term ''missionary position'' before Kinsey.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Robert Priest examined the origins of the term and concluded that Kinsey had confused several factors in accidentally coining the term.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt; First, according to Malinowski, Trobrianders played and sang mocking songs under the full moon, and not around a campfire. In ''Sexual Behaviors'', Kinsey wrote that the Trobrianders mocked face-to-face man-on-top woman-below intercourse, but does not give context. He mentioned that the position was learned from "white traders, planters, or officials", but does not discuss missionaries. Kinsey also recalled that the medieval Catholic Church taught the position, and upon seeing the natives mocking it, assumed that missionaries had taught it to them. Finally, Malinowski wrote that he saw an engaged Trobriand couple holding hands and leaning against each other, which the natives described as ''misinari si bubunela''—the ''missionary fashion''. Upon accidentally combining these similar facts, Kinsey invented a new phrase despite believing that he was reporting an old one.&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt;

From then on, the story of the name's origin may have been retold until it became largely accepted, with its connection to Kinsey and Malinowski having faded. Writers began using the expression for sexual intercourse in the late 1960s, and as [[Alex Comfort]]'s bestseller ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1976) spread the term ''missionary position'', it gradually replaced older names.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, it had spread to other languages: ''Missionarsstellung'' ([[German language|German]]), ''postura del misionero'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''missionarishouding'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and ''position du missionaire'' ([[French language|French]]).&lt;ref name="Priest, 31"/&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (Act 1, Scene 1), the missionary position was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called [[Beast with two backs|"the beast with two backs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello&amp;Act=1&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene|title=Othello, Act I, Scene 1 :-: Open Source Shakespeare|website=www.opensourceshakespeare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Wiki-missionary.png|thumb|Basic position involves [[ventral]]-ventral contact]]
Though there are a number of variations and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.

===Basic position===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
In the missionary position, a woman lies on her back on a bed or other surface with her legs comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The penetrating partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] her [[vulva]] or [[clitoris]] in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]], and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.

With the penis inside the woman's vagina, the man can control the force, depth, pace, and rhythm of [[Pelvic thrust|thrusts]], and can also control to some extent the female partner's movements. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against the mattress and by side movements in her pelvis as well as by clutching onto and moving with her partner.&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nilamadhab |last1=Kar |first2=Gopal Chandra |last2=Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=107–108| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.

The man may straddle the woman, taking the woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, and the man can increase the tightness on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.

During sexual intercourse, most women experience involuntary [[vaginal contraction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Ceskoslovenska psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction causes the [[pelvic muscles]] to tighten around the penis, which increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm, which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, but this is not always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a [[woman on top]] position.

During sexual intercourse in the missionary position, the penis is in preferential contact with the [[Anterior#Superior and inferior|anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis reaches the [[Fornix of the vagina|anterior fornix]], while in the rear-entry position it is in preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaches the posterior fornix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63–76 |year=2002 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |author1=A.

===Position of legs===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (13).jpg|left|thumb|Raising legs allows for deep penetration]]
A receiving woman's legs and arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.

A woman's legs can remain flat or raised toward her chest, or wrapped around the penetrating partner at various heights: at the back of the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the ''Wiener Auster'' or Viennese oyster.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexikon der Erotik'' by Lykke Aresin and Kurt Starke. Droemer-Knaur, 1996. {{ISBN|3-426-77174-8}}, p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position|title=Viennese Oyster - Sex Position - BabyMed.com|date=18 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separating straight legs carry the risk of [[muscle pull]] of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.

A pillow or [[sex pillow]] (especially a firm one) can be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutcherson |first=Hilda |title=What Your Mother Never Told You About Sex |publisher=Perigee Trade |year=2003 |isbn=0-399-52853-9 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; to alter the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve pressure on the top person's hands and arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blowfish.com/catalog/toys/cushions.html |title=Blowfish Sex Cushions |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing a pillow under the woman's buttocks can lift her pelvis—a ''[[Playboy]]'' article suggested placing it under her hips to increase pressure on the clitoris.&lt;ref name="MissionaryRevival"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, Kelly |url=http://www.playboy.com/sex/featuresLL/missionary/missionary.html |title=The Missionary Revival |publisher=Playboy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026095344/http://www.playboy.com/sex/featuresLL/missionary/missionary.html |archivedate=2007-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.have-better-sex.com/Sex-Positions-1 |title=Variations on a Theme - Him on Top Sex Positions |publisher=Better Sex |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one variant, the woman may lift and slightly bend her legs, resting her feet flat on the mattress. This shortens the distance between the [[vagina]] and [[cervix]], and may apply more friction to the area termed the ''[[G-Spot]].''{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The woman may find this more comfortable than the standard position,&lt;ref name="AddSpice"&gt;{{cite web |author=Strovny, David |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/47_love_tip.html |title=Add Spice to the Missionary Position |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Susan |title=Driving Your Woman Wild in Bed: A Man's Guide to Satisfying Women |isbn=0-8065-2430-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing the woman's legs on or over the man's shoulders provides the deepest possible penetration. This variant is sometimes called ''the anvil''.&lt;ref name="LoversGuide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loversguide.com/man-on-top-sex-positions-enhancing-the-missionary-position.html |title=Man-on-top sex positions: enhancing the missionary position |publisher=The Lovers' Guide |accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position aims the head of the penis at the [[vaginal fornix]] (posterior fornix). When the legs are held mid-level in this way, the penis can achieve significant depth while attempting to stimulate the G-Spot and achieving more friction on the top of its shaft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Viennese oyster position===
[[File:Wiki-Wiener-auster.png|right|thumb|A woman in the ''Wiener Auster'' (Viennese oyster) position]]
The Viennese oyster position requires great flexibility from the woman to perform. The female lies on her back and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;BabyMed [http://www.babymed.com/sex-positions/viennese-oyster-sex-position Viennese Oyster - Sex Position]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butterfly position===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (12).jpg|thumb|A woman in the butterfly position]]
The woman can lie on her back with her hips on the edge of a platform such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc.&lt;ref name="coville"&gt;Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or  restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the ''butterfly position'', adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced [[Sexual stimulation|clitoral stimulation]], and the woman may need direct clitoral [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.

===Riding high===
{{See also|Coital alignment technique}}
In the riding high missionary variant, the man enters the woman and then shifts his body up and forward toward her head. He then rocks back and forth, stimulating her clitoris with his pelvic bone, or base of his penis. This results in more consistent clitoral stimulation at the cost of a man's deep thrusting; accordingly, some men prefer to use it during only part of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Kira |url=http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |title=Rethink the Missionary Position: Three Ways to Spice up a Classic |publisher=Savvy Miss |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071224001208/http://www.savvymiss.com/love-advice/sex-advice/sex-sex-sex-archive/article/rethink-the-missionary-position-three-ways-to-spice-up-a-classic-4383/page-browse/1/sspn//8ac9f9dfdf.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Double image|right|Wiki-anal missionary.png|180|Wiki-tribadism02.png|180|Two men engaged in the missionary position during anal sex; two women engaged in the missionary position during tribadism}}
Penetrative [[anal sex]] may be performed on a partner in the missionary position.&lt;ref name="Alice"/&gt; The legs may be raised high, with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiver's hips for comfort and to raise the receiver's buttocks. The penetrating partner positions himself between the receiver's legs and aligns his penis with the anus for anal penetration. Instead of penetration, an active partner may perform [[anilingus]] on the partner with raised legs.

[[Tribadism]] between women may be performed in the missionary position.&lt;ref name="Hite, Tribadism"&gt;{{cite book | first = Shere| last = Hite |author-link=Shere Hite | title = The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality | publisher = [[Seven Stories Press]] | year = 2004 | location=New York, NY | isbn = 1583225692| page=322 | accessdate = 2 March 2012 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schell"&gt;{{cite book|author =Jude Schell|title =Lesbian Sex: 101 Lovemaking Positions|isbn =0-495-60274-4|publisher=[[Random House|Random House Digital]]|year=2008|pages=224 pages|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JHVndzmgDmYC&amp;pg=PP18&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice involves women rubbing their vulvas against each other.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite book|title =Exploring the Dimensions of Human Sexuality|id = 9780763741488|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=2007|page=429|accessdate=2010-12-19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdYh_iFZvbkC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+tribadism#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20and%20tribadism&amp;f=false|isbn =0-7637-4148-5|author1=Jerrold S.

==Perceived advantages and disadvantages==

===Psychological===

There are many appealing psychological aspects of the missionary position. It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact than in any other position; and the couple can hold each other in their arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Partners may engage in other intimate contact, such as kissing, or guiding each other's hips with their hands.&lt;ref name="BestLove"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cynthia Perkins |url=http://www.smolderingembers.com/missionary-sex-position.html |title=The Missionary Sex Position |publisher=Best Love Making Positions and Techniques |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sextherapyinphiladelphia.com/sexual-positions/ |title=Sexual Positions |publisher=Sex Therapy in Philadelphia |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aly Walansky |url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/59_love_tip.html |title=Sexual Positions Women Enjoy |publisher=AskMen |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the woman needs a high level of trust in the man on top who is in a dominant position vis-a-vis the woman below. Once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man's weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, the man has control of the rhythm and depth of his thrusts, in the most sexually sensitive part of her body.&lt;ref name="Colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |title=The Missionary Position |publisher=Sexual Health Center |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052524/http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_sexualidad/sexuality/sexual_positions/21_missionary_position.html |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
The missionary position is commonly used the first time a couple has sex. Thomas Stuttaford notes that it may be more comfortable to do so: "The discomfort of early penetrative sex, if there is any, is usually related to tension in the pelvic or thigh muscles and/or anxiety that has prevented the usual vaginal lubrication. Muscles of the pelvic floor are more relaxed if, initially, the missionary position is chosen and a couple of pillows are arranged under the woman's bottom so her hips are tilted upwards."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Stuttaford, Thomas (October 6, 2007). [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/advice/article1790243.ece Taking the First Steps]. Times Online. Retrieved on January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity of the position makes it well-suited to the inexperienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educativ.info/teen/virginity.html Losing Virginity]. Educativ. Retrieved on January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lovers' Guide states that missionary lends itself well to sex with a new partner as it is "a romantic yet fairly unadventurous sex position" that is "non-threatening and loving" and "lays neither partner open to strangeness, anxiety and unfamiliarity."&lt;ref name="LoversGuide"/&gt;

On the other hand, Sacha Tarkovsky advises women to not use the missionary position when having sex for the first time, stating, "You are not in control, and it will be more painful and you cannot do anything but lay {{sic}} there and take it." Tarkovsky recommends positions such as [[woman on top]] that allow the woman to control the speed and pressure at which she loses her [[hymen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky, Sascha.

Retrieved on January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may not be necessary to completely forgo missionary the first time; Alphonso Sirtle suggests starting with woman on top until the hymen is torn, and then possibly switching to missionary or whatever other position is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Sirtle, Alphonso.

According to Sexual Health Resource, "The man-on-top sex positions are very good for couples who are trying to have a baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws her thighs right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vagina—at the neck of the womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring."&lt;ref name="shr"/&gt; ''Getting Pregnant Tips'' notes the importance of not using too large a sex pillow while in the missionary position as it can cause the sperm to pool behind the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getting-pregnant-tips.com/best-position-to-get-pregnant.html |title=What is the best position to get pregnant? |publisher=Getting Pregnant Tips |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183013/http://www.getting-pregnant-tips.com/best-position-to-get-pregnant.html |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francoeur states that "male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg."&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; However, according to BabyCenter, "There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BabyCenter |date=May 2007 |url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_sex-positions-for-baby-making_1812.bc |title=Sexual positions for baby-making |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donnica Moore]] agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mann, Denise |year=2005 |url=http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/features/truth-about-sexual-positions-getting-pregnant |title=The Truth About Sexual Positions and Getting Pregnant |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deep penetration and large hip thrusts of the missionary position can cause the man to reach orgasm quickly compared to other positions, which can be problematic if the couple seeks to reach simultaneous orgasm.&lt;ref name="PregnantStore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnantstore.com/SexualPositionsGuide-ManOnTop.html |title=Man on Top Sexual Positions |publisher=Pregnant Store |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715143950/http://www.pregnantstore.com/SexualPositionsGuide-ManOnTop.html |archivedate=July 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male reaching orgasm first can be disruptive to sex, as 50% of penile erection is lost immediately after ejaculation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/Handouts/male_function_dysfunction.html |title=Male Sexual Function/Dysfunction |publisher=McKinley Health Center |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him more likely to inadvertently slip out of the vagina, especially during the strong pelvic contractions of female orgasm. In addition to the standard [[Premature ejaculation#Treatment|methods for treating premature ejaculation]], Zachary Veilleux notes that this problem can be overcome by workarounds such as changing positions frequently (which studies have shown delays male orgasm by a factor of 2-3), using lubrication to reduce friction (friction stimulates the male but is not as important in female orgasm), or switching to cunnilingus for a while when close to ejaculation, and then switching back when ejaculation is no longer imminent.&lt;ref name="Synch"&gt;{{cite web|author=Veilleux, Zachary |url=http://www.menshealthsa.co.za/index.php?cat=1186&amp;art_id=908 |title=Sychronized Schwinging |publisher=Men's Health |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416182848/http://www.menshealthsa.co.za/index.php?cat=1186 |archivedate=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position is sometimes mocked as a plain [[vanilla sex]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saferinjecting.net/sex-kinky.htm |title=But isn't that kinky?: sex in the animal kingdom |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archer stated, "To all the sex gymnasts, this kind of banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed," but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: "Missionary is kind of like tofu: You have to add your own flavor."&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Archer, Rebecca |year=2002 |url=http://www.nerve.com/PersonalEssays/Archer/MissionaryPosition/ |title=In Praise of the Missionary Position |publisher=Nerve |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, and the fact that it is literally a "male-superior" position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, "the cultural missionary position—man on top" is not conducive to romance since "If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peres, Judy |date=2008-11-17 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-17/news/0711170033_1_sexual-satisfaction-satisfaction-and-greater-relationship-stronger-romantic-relationships |title=Study: Feminists are better mates |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Women Who Love Sex'', Ogden writes, "Think what will happen to the missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ogden, Gina |date=September 1999 |title=Women Who Love Sex |publisher=Womanspirit Press |isbn=978-0-9672705-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinua Achebe's ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Achebe, Chinua |title=Things Fall Apart |isbn=0-7660-2831-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary position has potential for clitoral stimulation in several ways. Christakos assures, "This position can give the woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man leans forward thus rubbing his pelvic bone against her clitoris."&lt;ref name="Christakos"&gt;Christakos, Caterina.

Sexual activity in the missionary position, as a form of physical exercise, may be slightly more vigorous for the man than in other positions. A study conducted by Bohlen et al. found that "man-on-top coitus required more metabolic expenditure than woman-on-top coitus" and that the heart rate during man-on-top sex was higher than in self-stimulation, partner stimulation, or woman-on-top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rerkpattanapipat, P. |date=February 2001 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/ehj/22/3/201.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sex and the heart: what is the role of the cardiologist? |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, one study showed that there was no difference in heart rate or blood pressure when comparing these two basic positions, while another showed only a minor decrease in oxygen consumption or exertion with the 'man-on-bottom' technique during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwarz |first1=E.R. |last2=Rodriguez |first2=J. |year=2005 |url=http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v17/n1s/full/3901422a.html |title=Sex and the heart |publisher=International Journal of Impotence Research |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canongate. Retrieved on January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Some [[Kerala]] tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt;

In ancient Greece, the missionary position was originally an unpopular position. Beds existed, yet not as we know them today, and men married girls 14 or 15 years of age, which created a height differential. These factors made the rear-entry standing position more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tarkovsky, Sacha|title=Sex in Ancient Greece Views Towards Sex Positions}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, circa the second century, Artemidos popularized the missionary position among Greco-Roman Stoics, declaring it "the only proper and natural" position due to the flow of [[semen]].

Although the Bible does not mention sexual positions, from the 6th to 16th centuries, some Church authorities taught that intercourse should be face-to-face, man-on-top, primarily because they believed that semen flows with gravity, leading to conception.&lt;ref name="pmid14992209"/&gt; Exceptions were made for couples dealing with illness, obesity, or pregnancy. According to John Bancroft's ''Human Sexuality and Its Problems'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] believed that crimes against nature included intercourse in "unnatural" ways. Protestants did not communicate proper sex positions, and the Catholic Church eventually abandoned its discourse on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Hardy]] wrote that the missionary position was used to distinguish "bestial and civilized sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardy |first=Simon |title=The Greeks, Eroticism and Ourselves |journal=Sexualities |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |issn=1363-4607 |doi=10.1177/1363460704042164 |page =201 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who held that missionary was the only permitted position included [[Alexander of Hales]] and the author of ''De secretis mulierum'',{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} who suggested that nonstandard positions might result in birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, James A. ''Law, sex, and Christian society in medieval Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Mazo Karras states that [[William Peraldus]]' treatise ''Summa de virtutibus et vitiis'' distinguished between sins against nature that were "according to the substance" (intercourse other than vaginal) and "according to the manner, as when a woman mounts."&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. ''Sexuality in Medieval Europe: Doing Unto Others''. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Venette's 1770s-era sex manual praised the missionary position as the "common posture...which is most allowable and most voluptuous."&lt;ref&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. ''Sex and the Gender Revolution''. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous sources have reported that in the [[United States]], some states had outlawed positions other than missionary between husband and wife, or will grant a divorce to a woman whose husband makes love to her in another position. While many states formerly outlawed [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[buggery]], or other "unnatural" acts, no US law has banned dorso-ventral heterosexual sex, or specified which partner needed to be on top.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D'Emilio|D'Emilio]] and [[Estelle Freedman|Freedman]], who are historians of sexuality, note that historical use of the missionary position in the US is marked by social class as well as ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/783150238|title=Intimate matters : a history of sexuality in America|last=D'Emilio|first=John|last2=Freedman|first2=Estelle|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=2012|isbn=9780226923802|edition= Third|location=Chicago, IL|pages=|at=|oclc=783150238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, white settlers and Protestant missionaries who moved West attempted to assimilate Native American, Mexican, and immigrant peoples into the sexual values held by the middle classes in the American north. These authors also note that the Kinsey studies revealed social class influences, with working class men preferring to use the missionary position over other sexual positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mythopoeic thought''' is a hypothetical stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by [[Henri Frankfort]] and his wife Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a "mythopoeic" stage, in which humanity did not think in terms of generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will on the part of some personal being. This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create [[myth]]s, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by [[Julian Jaynes]] in 1976 in the form of [[bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

==The term==
The term ''[[wikt:mythopoeic|mythopoeic]]'' means "myth-making" (from Greek ''muthos,'' "myth", and ''poiein,'' "to make"). A group of Near Eastern specialists used the term in their 1946 book ''The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East,'' later republished as the 1949 paperback ''Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man.''&lt;ref&gt; Segal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In this book's introduction, two of the specialists, Henri and Mrs. H.A. Frankfort, argue that mythopoeic thought characterizes a distinct stage of human thought that differs fundamentally from modern, scientific thought. Mythopoeic thought, the Frankforts claim, was concrete and personifying, whereas modern thought is abstract and impersonal: more basically, mythopoeic thought is "pre-philosophical", while modern thought is "philosophical".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this basic contrast between mythopoeic and modern thought, the Frankforts often use the term "mythopoeic thought" as a synonym for ancient thought in general.

==Characteristics==

===Personalistic view of nature===
According to the Frankforts, "the fundamental difference between the attitudes of modern and ancient man as regards the surrounding world is this: for modern, scientific man the phenomenal world is primarily an 'It'; for ancient—and also for primitive—man it is a 'Thou'".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, modern man sees most things as impersonal objects, whereas ancient man sees most things as persons.

According to the Frankforts, ancients viewed the world this way because they didn't think in terms of universal laws. Modern thought "reduces the chaos of perceptions to an order in which typical events take place according to universal laws."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"&gt;Frankfort, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a river that usually rises in the spring. Suppose that, one spring, the river fails to rise. In that case, modern thought doesn't conclude that the laws of nature have changed; instead, it searches for a set of fixed, universal laws that can explain why the river has risen in other cases but not in this case. Modern thought is abstract: it looks for unifying principles behind diversity.

In contrast, the Frankforts argue, "the primitive mind cannot withdraw to that extent from perceptual reality".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Mythopoeic thought doesn't look for unifying principles behind the diversity of individual events. It is concrete, not abstract: it takes each individual event at face value. When a river rises one year and fails to rise another year, mythopoeic thought doesn't try to unite those two different events under a common law. Instead, "when the river does not rise, it has ''refused'' to rise".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; And if no law governs the river's behavior, if the river has simply "refused" to rise, then its failure to rise must be a ''choice'': "The river, or the gods, must be angry", and must be ''choosing'' to withhold the annual flooding.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Thus, mythopoeic thought ends up viewing the entire world as personal: each event is an act of will.

===Tolerance of contradiction===
The Frankforts argue that mythopoeic thought explains the tolerance of seeming contradictions in mythology. According to the Frankforts' theory, the ancients didn't try to unite different experiences under a universal law; instead, they took each individual experience at face value. Therefore, they sometimes took one experience and developed a myth from it, and took a different experience and developed a different myth from it, without worrying whether those two myths contradicted each other: "The ancients ... are likely to present various descriptions of natural phenomena side by side even though they are mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient Egyptians had three different creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 50–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==The loss of mythopoeic thought==
According to the Frankforts, "ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians"—the Frankforts' area of expertise—"lived in a wholly mythopoeic world".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"&gt;Segal, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Each natural force, each concept, was a personal being from their viewpoint: "In Egypt and Mesopotamia the divine was comprehended as [[immanent]]: the gods were in nature."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"&gt;Frankfort, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; This immanence and multiplicity of the divine is a direct result of mythopoeic thought: hence, the first step in the loss of mythopoeic thought was the loss of this view of the divine. The ancient Hebrews took this first step through their doctrine of a single, transcendent God: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we read in Psalm 19 that 'the heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork,' we hear a voice which mocks the beliefs of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The heavens, which were to the psalmist but a witness of God's greatness, were to the Mesopotamians the very majesty of godhead, the highest ruler, [[Anu]]. [...] The God of the psalmists and the prophets was not in nature. He transcended nature — and transcended, likewise, the realm of mythopoeic thought."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ancient Hebrews still saw each major event as a divine act. However, they saw the divine as a single being—not a myriad of spirits, one for each natural phenomenon. Moreover, they didn't see the divine as a will within nature: for them, the divine will was a force or law ''behind'' all natural events.

Some Greek philosophers went further. Instead of seeing each event as an act of will, they developed a notion of impersonal, universal law: they finally abandoned mythopoeic thought, postulating impersonal laws behind all natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; These philosophers may not have been scientific by today's rigid standards: their hypotheses were often based on assumptions, not empirical data.&lt;ref name ="Frankfort, p. 386"&gt;Frankfort, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the mere fact that they looked behind the apparent diversity and individuality of events in search of underlying laws, and defied "the prescriptive sanctities of religion", the Greeks broke away from mythopoeic thought.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 386"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Religious scholar Robert Segal has pointed out that the dichotomy between a personal and an impersonal view of the world is not absolute, as the Frankforts' distinction between ancient and modern thought might suggest: "Any phenomenon can surely be experienced as both an It and a Thou: consider, for example, a pet and a patient."&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; Furthermore, Segal argues, it is "embarrassingly simplistic" to call the ancient Near East "wholly mythopoeic", the Hebrews "largely nonmythopoeic", and the Greeks "wholly scientific".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt;

'''Neurotoxicity''' is a form of [[toxicity]] in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the [[central nervous system|central]] and/or [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunha-Oliveira T, Rego AC, Oliveira CR | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the neurotoxicity of opioid and psychostimulant drugs | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 192–208 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18440072 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.03.002 | quote = The Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology defined neurotoxicity as a broad concept, including any adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system by a biological, chemical or physical agent.

Neurotoxicity can result from [[organ transplant]]s, [[radiation treatment]], certain [[drug therapy|drug therapies]] (e.g., substances used in [[chemotherapy]]), [[recreational drug use]], and exposure to [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Neurotoxicity of pesticides. Keifer MC(1), Firestone J.

Costa LG(1), Giordano G, Guizzetti M, Vitalone A. Author information: (1)Dept. of Environmental and ...&lt;/ref&gt; certain industrial cleaning [[solvent]]s, and certain naturally occurring substances.  Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed. They may include limb weakness or numbness, loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect, uncontrollable obsessive and/or compulsive behaviors, delusions, headache, cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction.

The term ''neurotoxicity'' implies the involvement of a neurotoxin; however, the term ''neurotoxic'' may be used more loosely to describe states that are known to cause physical [[brain damage]], but where no specific neurotoxin has been identified.

The presence of [[neurocognitive deficit]]s alone is not usually considered sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity, as many substances may impair [[neurocognitive]] performance without resulting in the death of neurons. This may be due to the direct action of the substance, with the impairment and neurocognitive deficits being temporary, and resolving when the substance is [[drug elimination|eliminated]] from the body. In some cases the level or exposure-time may be critical, with some substances only becoming neurotoxic in certain doses or time periods. Some of the most common naturally occurring brain toxins that lead to neurotoxicity as a result of excessive drug use are [[beta amyloid]] (Aβ), [[glutamate]], [[dopamine]], and [[oxygen radicals]]. When present in high concentrations, they can lead to neurotoxicity and death ([[apoptosis]]). Some of the symptoms that result from cell death include loss of motor control, cognitive deterioration and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, neurotoxicity has been found to be a major cause of [[neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).

==Neurotoxic agents==

===Beta amyloid===
Aβ was found to cause neurotoxicity and cell death in the brain when present in high concentrations. Aβ results from a mutation that occurs when protein chains are cut at the wrong locations, resulting in chains of different lengths that are unusable. Thus they are left in the brain until they are broken down, but if enough accumulate, they form [[Senile plaques|plaques]] which are toxic to [[neurons]]. Aβ uses several routes in the [[central nervous system]] to cause cell death. An example is through the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (nAchRs), which is a receptor commonly found along the surfaces of the cells that respond to nicotine stimulation, turning them on or off. Aβ was found manipulating the level of [[nicotine]] in the brain along with the [[MAP kinase]], another signaling receptor, to cause cell death. Another chemical in the brain that Aβ regulates is [[JNK]]; this chemical halts the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinases]] (ERK) pathway, which normally functions as memory control in the brain. As a result, this memory favoring pathway is stopped, and the brain loses essential memory function. The loss of memory is a symptom of [[neurodegenerative disease]], including AD. Another way Aβ causes cell death is through the phosphorylation of [[AKT]]; this occurs as the element phosphate is bound to several sites on the protein. This phosphorylation allows AKT to interact with [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]], a protein known to cause cell death. Thus an increase in Aβ results in an increase of the AKT/BAD complex, in turn stopping the action of the anti-apoptotic protein [[Bcl-2]], which normally functions to stop cell death, causing accelerated neuron breakdown and the progression of AD.

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate]] is a chemical found in the brain that poses a toxic threat to [[neuron]]s when found in high concentrations. This concentration equilibrium is extremely delicate and is usually found in millimolar amounts extracellularly. When disturbed, an accumulation of glutamate occurs as a result of a mutation in the [[glutamate transporters]], which act like pumps to drain glutamate from the brain. This causes glutamate concentration to be several times higher in the blood than in the brain; in turn, the body must act to maintain equilibrium between the two concentrations by pumping the glutamate out of the bloodstream and into the neurons of the brain. In the event of a mutation, the glutamate transporters are unable to pump the glutamate back into the cells; thus a higher concentration accumulates at the [[glutamate receptors]]. This opens the ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell causing excitotoxicity.  Glutamate results in cell death by turning on the [[N-methyl-D-aspartic acid]] receptors (NMDA); these receptors cause an increased release of calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the cells. As a result, the increased concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; directly increases the stress on [[mitochondria]], resulting in excessive [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) via the activation of [[nitric oxide synthase]], ultimately leading to cell death. Aβ was also found aiding this route to neurotoxicity by enhancing neuron vulnerability to glutamate.

===Oxygen radicals===
The formation of [[oxygen radicals]] in the brain is achieved through the [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) pathway. This reaction occurs as a response to an increase in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration inside a brain cell. This interaction between the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and NOS results in the formation of the cofactor [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH4), which then moves from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. As a final step, NOS is dephosphorylated yielding [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which accumulates in the brain, increasing its [[oxidative stress]]. There are several ROS, including [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[hydroxyl]], all of which lead to neurotoxicity. Naturally, the body utilizes a defensive mechanism to diminish the fatal effects of the reactive species by employing certain enzymes to break down the ROS into small, benign molecules of simple oxygen and water. However, this breakdown of the ROS is not completely efficient; some reactive residues are left in the brain to accumulate, contributing to neurotoxicity and cell death. The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress than other organs, due to its low oxidative capacity. Because [[neuron]]s are characterized as [[postmitotic]] cells, meaning that they live with accumulated damage over the years, accumulation of ROS is fatal. Thus, increased levels of ROS age neurons, which leads to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and ultimately the advancement of AD.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends upon the length and degree of exposure and the severity of neurological injury. In some instances, exposure to neurotoxins can be fatal. In others, patients may survive but not fully recover. In other situations, many individuals recover completely after treatment.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''neurotoxicity'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ʊər|oʊ-|t|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ᵻ|t|i}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:neuro-#Prefix|neuro-]]'' + ''[[wikt:tox-#Prefix|tox-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-icity#Suffix|-icity]]'', yielding "[[nervous tissue]] poisoning".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12962">'''Onomasiology''' (from {{lang-el|ὀνομάζω}} (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "how do you express X?" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of [[lexicology]], the study of words (although some apply the term also to [[grammar]] and conversation). 

Onomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior&lt;ref&gt;OED: "The study of language which deals with the identification of a preconceived
meaning or concept by name or names"&lt;/ref&gt;
(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as [[semasiology]]: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" (answers: ''french fries'' in the US, ''chips'' in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., "what is the meaning of the term ''chips''?" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).

Onomasiology can be carried out [[wikt:synchronic|synchronically]] or [[wikt:diachronic|diachronically]], i.e. historically.

==Definition==

Onomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in [[Romance languages]]. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and [[Hugo Schuchardt]] started the "[[Wörter und Sachen]]" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the "dame phonétique" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the "dame sémantique" (justify semantic changes).

Another branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable [[linguistic atlas]]es. The first ones are ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, the ALF (''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'') by [[Jules Gilliéron]] (1902–1920), the AIS (''Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'') by [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]] (1928–1940), the DSA (''Deutscher Sprachatlas'') by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by [[Hans Kurath]], the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).

In 1931 the German linguist [[Jost Trier]] introduced a new method in his book ''Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes'' which is known as the [[lexical field theory]]. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by [[Cecil H. Brown]], [[Stanley R. Witkowski]], [[Brent Berlin]]). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of [[Dirk Geeraerts]], Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical ''Onomasiology Online'', which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by [[Joachim Grzega]], Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.

==Instruments for the historical onomasiologist==

The most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:
* the [[linguistic atlas]]
* the [[etymological dictionary]]
* the dialect dictionary
* [[thesaurus|thesauri]]
* diachronic [[text corpus|text corpora]]

==Lexical change==
===Explanations===

When a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.

The coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):
* difficulties in classifying the thing to be named or attributing the right word to the thing to be named, thus confusing designations
* fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world
* everyday contact situations
* institutionalized and non-institutionalized linguistic pre- and proscriptivism
* flattery
* insult
* disguising things (i.e. [[euphemism|euphemistic]] language, [[doublespeak]])
* taboo
* avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words
* abolition of forms that can be ambiguous in many contexts
* wordplay/puns
* excessive length of words
* morphological misinterpretation (creation of transparency by changes within a word = [[folk-etymology]])
* deletion of irregularity
* desire for plastic/illustrative/telling names for a thing
* natural prominence of a concept
* cultural-induced prominence of a concept
* changes in the world
* changes in the categorization of the world
* prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

The following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.

===Processes===

In the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected ["naming in a more abstract sense"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected ["naming in a more concrete sense"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.

If the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):

* adoption of either
# an already existing word of speaker's own language ([[semantic change]]) or (b)
# a word from a foreign language ([[loanword]])
* [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (e.g. ''to e-mail'' from the noun ''e-mail'')
* composition (in a broad sense, i.e. [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and derivations, which are, very consciously, not further subclassified)
* [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] (i.e. morpheme deletion, e.g. the noun ''daily'' from ''daily newspaper'')
* [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] (i.e. morpheme shortening, e.g. ''fan'' from ''fanatic'')
* [[acronym]]s (e.g. ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* [[Blend word|blend]]ings (including [[folk-etymology|folk-etymologies]], although these come up non-intentionally, e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* [[back-derivation]] (e.g. ''to baby-sit'' from ''babysitter'')
* [[reduplication]] (e.g. ''goody-goody'')
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] alteration (e.g. number change as in ''people'' as a plural word instead of a singular word)
* [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] compounds (e.g. ''peacock'' for original ''pea'', which already meant 'peacock')
* wordplaying/[[pun]]s
* stress alteration (e.g. stress shift in E. ''ímport'' vs. ''impórt'')
* graphic alteration (e.g. E. ''discrete'' vs. ''discreet'')
* [[Phraseology|phraseologism]]
* [[Root (linguistics)|root creation]] (including [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] and expressive words)

The name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.

In order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations ([[iconeme]]s) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:

*contiguity relations (= "neighbor-of" relations)
*similarity relations (= "similar-to" relations)
*partiality relations (= "part-of" relations)
*contrast relations (= "opposite-to" relations)
These relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. 

A complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):

* identity (e.g. with loans)
* "figurative", i.e. individually felt, similarity of the concepts (e.g. ''mouse'' for a computer device that looks '''like''' a mouse)
* contiguity of concepts (e.g. ''a Picasso'' for a painting '''by''' Picasso or ''glass'' for a container made '''out of''' glass)
* partiality of concepts (e.g. ''bar'' 'place of an inn where drinks are mixed' for the '''entire''' inn)
* contrast of concepts (e.g. ''bad'' in the sense of "good")
* "literal" or "figurative" similarity between the forms of a sign and the concept (e.g. with onomatopoetic words like ''purr'')
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. with generalization of meaning, e.g. ''Christmas tree'' for any kind of fir tree or even any kind of conifer)
* strong relation between contents of signs and contrast of concepts (e.g. with ''learn'' in the sense of "teach" in some English dialects)
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. ''corn'' in the English sense of "wheat" or Scottish sense of "oats" instead of "cereal")
* ("literal") similarity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* contiguity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''brunch'' from ''breakfast + lunch'', ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* "literal", i.e. objectively visible, similarity and contiguity of concepts (e.g. with the transfer of names among spruce and fir in many dialects)
* "literal" similarity of referents and strong relation between contents of signs
* multiple associations (e.g. with certain forms of word-play)

The concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

'''Peripatric speciation''' is a mode of [[speciation]] in which a new [[species]] is formed from an isolated peripheral population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation |author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr |date=2004 |pages=1–545 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} Since peripatric speciation resembles [[allopatric speciation]], in that populations are isolated and prevented from [[Gene flow|exchanging genes]], it can often be difficult to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{Citation |title=Divergence at the edges: peripatric isolation in the montane spiny throated reed frog complex |author=Lucinda P. Lawson, John M Bates, Michele Menegon, &amp; Simon P. Loader |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |year=2015 |volume=15 |issue=128 |doi=10.1186/s12862-015-0384-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the primary characteristic of peripatric speciation proposes that one of the populations is much smaller than the other. The terms '''peripatric''' and '''peripatry''' are often used in [[biogeography]], referring to [[organism]]s whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do not occur—for example on an [[oceanic island]] compared to the mainland. Such organisms are usually closely related (''e.g.'' [[sister species]]); their distribution being the result of peripatric speciation.

The concept of peripatric speciation was first outlined by the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Mayr1954"&gt;Ernst Mayr. (1954). Change of genetic environment and evolution. In J. Huxley, A. C. Hardy &amp; E. B. Ford. (eds) ''Evolution as a Process'', Unwin Brothers, London. Pp. 157–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other alternative models have been developed such as '''centrifugal speciation''', that posits that a species' population experiences periods of geographic [[range expansion]] followed by shrinking periods, leaving behind small isolated populations on the periphery of the main population. Other models have involved the effects of [[sexual selection]] on limited population sizes. Other related models of peripherally isolated populations based on chromosomal rearrangements have been developed such as '''budding speciation''' and '''quantum speciation'''.

The existence of peripatric speciation is supported by observational evidence and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} Scientists observing the patterns of a species biogeographic distribution and its [[phylogenetic]] relationships are able to reconstruct the historical process by which they [[Genetic divergence|diverged]]. Further, oceanic islands are often the subject of peripatric speciation research due to their isolated habitats—with the [[Hawaiian Islands]] widely represented in much of the scientific literature.

== History ==
{{main|History of speciation}}
Peripatric speciation was originally proposed by [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1954,&lt;ref name="Mayr1954"/&gt; and fully theoretically modeled in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr. (1982). Processes of speciation in animals. In A. R. I. Liss. (eds) ''Mechanisms of Speciation'', Alan R. Liss Inc., New York. Pp. 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[founder effect]], where small living populations may undergo selection bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. B. Provine |title=Ernst Mayr: Genetics and speciation |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/167/3/1041 |journal=Genetics |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=1041–6 |date=1 July 2004|pmid=15280221 |pmc=1470966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder effect is based on models that suggest peripatric speciation can occur by the interaction of selection and [[genetic drift]],&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} which may play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alan R. Templeton |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 |date=1 April 1980|pmid=6777243 |pmc=1214177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr first conceived of the idea by his observations of [[kingfisher]] populations in New Guinea and its surrounding islands.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} ''[[Common paradise kingfisher|Tanysiptera galatea]]'' was largely uniform in morphology on the mainland, but the populations on the surrounding islands differed significantly—referring to this pattern as "peripatric".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} This same pattern was observed by many of Mayr's contemporaries at the time such as by [[E. B. Ford|E. B. Ford's]] studies of ''[[Maniola jurtina]]''.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;{{Citation | title=Animal Species and Evolution | edition= | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1963 | pages=1–797 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|522}} Around the same time, the botanist [[Verne Grant]] developed a model of quantum speciation very similar to Mayr's model in the context of plants.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt;

In what has been called Mayr's genetic revolutions, he postulated that genetic drift played the primary role that resulted in this pattern.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} Seeing that a species cohesion is maintained by conservative forces such as [[epistasis]] and the slow pace of the spread of favorable alleles in a large population (based heavily on [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s calculations), he reasoned that speciation could only take place in which a [[population bottleneck]] occurred.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|389}} A small, isolated, founder population could be established on an island for example. Containing less genetic variation from the main population, shifts in allele frequencies may occur from different selection pressures.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|390}} This to further changes in the network of linked loci, driving a cascade of genetic change, or a "genetic revolution"—a large-scale reorganization of the entire genome of the peripheral population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|391}} Mayr did recognize that the chances of success were incredibly low and that extinction was likely; though noting that some examples of successful founder populations existed at the time.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|522}}

Shortly after Mayr, William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. In 1976 and 1980, the Kaneshiro model of peripatric speciation was developed by [[Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro]] which focused on sexual selection as a driver for speciation during population bottlenecks.&lt;ref name=KYK1976&gt;{{Citation |title=Ethological isolation and phylogeny in the Plantibia subgroup of Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' |author=Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro |journal=Evolution |year=1976 |volume=30 |issue= 4 |pages=740–745 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1976.tb00954.x |pmid=28563322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KYK1980&gt;{{Citation |title=Sexual selection, speciation and the direction of evolution |author=Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro |journal=Evolution |year=1980 |volume=34 |issue= 3|pages=437–444 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1980.tb04833.x| pmid=28568697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AO&amp;ABF2002&gt;{{Citation |title=Sexual selection and peripatric speciation: the Kaneshiro model revisited |author=Anders Ödeen &amp; Ann-Britt Florin |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |year=2002 |volume=15 |issue= |pages=301–306 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00378.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
=== Peripatric ===
Peripatric speciation models are identical to models of [[vicariance]] (allopatric speciation).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} Requiring both geographic separation and time, speciation can result as a predictable byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation |author=Michael Turelli, Nicholas H. Barton, &amp; Jerry A. Coyne |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |year=2001 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=330–343 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peripatry can be distinguished from allopatric speciation by three key features:&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}}
*The size of the isolated population
*Strong [[Natural selection|selection]] caused by the dispersal and colonization of novel environments, 
*The effects of [[genetic drift]] on small populations.

The size of a population is important because individuals colonizing a new habitat likely contain only a small sample of the genetic variation of the original population. This promotes divergence due to strong selective pressures, leading to the rapid [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] of an [[allele]] within the descendant population. This gives rise to the potential for genetic incompatibilities to [[evolution|evolve]]. These incompatibilities cause [[reproductive isolation]], giving rise to—sometimes rapid—speciation events.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|105}} Furthermore, two important predictions are invoked, namely that geological or climactic changes cause populations to become locally fragmented (or regionally when considering allopatric speciation), and that an isolated population's reproductive traits evolve enough as to prevent interbreeding upon potential [[secondary contact]].&lt;ref name="ST2007"&gt;{{Citation |title=Song divergence at the edge of Amazonia: an empirical test of the peripatric speciation model |author=Nathalie Seddon &amp; Joseph A. Tobias |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |year=2007 |volume=90 |pages=173–188 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00753.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peripatric model results in, what have been called, progenitor-derivative species pairs, whereby the derivative species (the peripherally isolated population)—geographically and genetically isolated from the progenitor species—diverges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Progenitor-derivative species pairs and plant speciation |author=Daniel J. Crawford |journal=Taxon |year=2010 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1413–1423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] signature results from this mode of speciation: the geographically widespread progenitor species becomes [[paraphyletic]] (thereby becoming a [[paraspecies]]), with respect to the derivative species (the peripheral isolate).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|470}} The concept of a paraspecies is therefore a logical consequence of the [[Species#Evolutionary species|evolutionary species concept]], by which one species gives rise to a daughter species.&lt;ref name="AlbertReis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Albert &amp; Roberto E. Reis |title=Historical Biogeography of Neotropical Freshwater Fishes |url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8kZeHxkv9oC&amp;pg=PA316 |isbn=978-0-520-26868-5 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the character traits of the peripherally isolated species become [[Symplesiomorphy|apomorphic]], while the central population remains [[Symplesiomorphy|pleisomorphic]].&lt;ref name="JKFrey"&gt;{{Citation |title=Modes of Peripheral Isolate Formation and Speciation |author=Jennifer K. Frey |journal=Systematic Biology |year=1993 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=373–381 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.3.373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cladistic methods have developed definitions that have incidentally removed derivative species by defining clades in a way that assumes that when a speciation event occurs, the original species no longer exists, while two new species arise; this is not the case in peripatric speciation.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt; Mayr warned against this, as it causes a species to lose their classification status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A local flora and the biological species concept |author=Ernst Mayr |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1992 |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=222–238 |doi=10.2307/2445111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loren H. Rieseberg and Luc Brouillet recognized the same dilemma in plant classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Are many plant species paraphyletic? |author=Loren H. Rieseberg and Luc Brouillet |journal=Taxon |year=1994 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=21–32 |doi=10.2307/1223457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum and budding speciation ===
The botanist Verne Grant proposed the term quantum speciation that combined the ideas of [[J. T. Gulick]] (his observation of the variation of species in semi-isolation), [[Sewall Wright]] (his models of genetic drift), Mayr (both his peripatric and genetic revolution models), and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (his development of the idea of [[quantum evolution]]).&lt;ref name="Grant1971"&gt;{{Citation|title=Plant Speciation |author=Verne Grant |date=1971 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0231083262 |pages=432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} Quantum speciation is a rapid process with large genotypic or phenotypic effects, whereby a new, cross-fertilizing plant species buds off from a larger population as a semi-isolated peripheral population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Speciational trends and the role of species in macroevolution |author=Douglas J. Futuyma |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1989 |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=318–321 |doi=10.1086/284983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant1971"/&gt;{{rp|114}} Interbreeding and genetic drift takes place due to the reduced population size, driving changes to the genome that would most likely result in extinction (due to low adaptive value).&lt;ref name="Grant1971"/&gt;{{rp|115}} In rare instances, chromosomal traits with adaptive value may arise, resulting in the origin of a new, derivative species.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"&gt;{{Citation|title=Rethinking classic examples of recent speciation in plants |author=L. D. Gottlieb |journal=New Phytologist |year=2003 |volume=161 |issue= |pages=71–82 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00922.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chromosomal rearrangements and speciation |author=Loren H. Rieseberg |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |year=2001 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=351–358 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the occurrence of this type of speciation has been found in several plant species pairs: ''[[Layia discoidea]]'' and ''[[Layia glandulosa|L. glandulosa]]'', ''[[Clarkia lingulata]]'' and ''[[Clarkia biloba|C. biloba]]'', and ''[[Stephanomeria malheurensis]]'' and ''S. exigua'' ssp. ''coronaria''.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2003"/&gt;

A closely related model of peripatric speciation is called budding speciation—largely applied in the context of plant speciation.&lt;ref name="Anacker&amp;Strauss2013"&gt;{{Citation|title=The geography and ecology of plant speciation: range overlap and niche divergence in sister species |author=Brian L. Anacker and Sharon Y. Strauss |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year=2013 |volume=281 |issue=1778 |pages= |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2980 |pmc=3906944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding process, where a new species originates at the margins of an ancestral range, is thought to be common in plants&lt;ref name="Anacker&amp;Strauss2013"/&gt;—especially in progenitor-derivative species pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Progenitor-derivative species pairs and plant speciation |author=Daniel J. Crawford |journal=Taxon |year=2010 |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1413–1423 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centrifugal speciation ===
William Louis Brown, Jr. proposed an alternative model of peripatric speciation in 1957 called centrifugal speciation. This model contrasts with peripatric speciation by virtue of the origin of the genetic novelty that leads to reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{Citation |title=Patterns of Parapatric Speciation |author=Sergey Gavrilets, Hai Li, &amp; Michael D. Vose |journal=Evolution |year=2000 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=1126–1134 |doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1126:pops]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A population of a species experiences periods of geographic range expansion followed by periods of contraction. During the contraction phase, fragments of the population become isolated as small [[Refugium (population biology)|refugial]] populations on the periphery of the central population. Because of the large size and potentially greater genetic variation within the central population, [[mutation]]s arise more readily. These mutations are left in the isolated peripheral populations, whereby, promoting reproductive isolation. Consequently, Brown suggested that during another expansion phase, the central population would overwhelm the peripheral populations, hindering speciation. However, if the species finds a specialized ecological niche, the two may coexist.&lt;ref name="DJH"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniel J. Howard |title=Speciation: Allopatric |journal=eLS |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd |location=Chichester |date=2003 |url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/npg.els.0001748/abstract |doi=10.1038/npg.els.0001748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Centrifugal speciation |author=W.

In contrast to centrifugal speciation, peripatric speciation has sometimes been referred to as '''centripetal speciation''' (see figures 1 and 2 for a contrast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Interview with John C.

== Evidence ==
{{see also|Allopatric speciation#Observational evidence}}
Observational evidence and laboratory experiments support the occurrence of peripatric speciation. [[Island]]s and [[archipelago]]s are often the subject of speciation studies in that they represent isolated populations of organisms. Island species provide direct evidence of speciation occurring peripatrically in such that, "the presence of [[endemism|endemic]] species on oceanic islands whose closest relatives inhabit a nearby [[continent]]" must have originated by a colonization event.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106–107}} Comparative [[phylogeography]] of oceanic [[archipelago]]s shows consistent patterns of sequential colonization and speciation along island chains, most notably on the [[Azores]] islands, [[Canary Islands]], [[Society Islands]], [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Austral Islands]], and the Hawaiian Islands—all of which express geological patterns of spatial isolation and, in some cases, linear arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Comparative phylogeography of oceanic archipelagos: Hotspots for inferences of evolutionary process |author=Kerry L.

Peripatric speciation has been researched in both laboratory studies and nature. [[Jerry Coyne]] and [[H. Allen Orr]] in ''Speciation'' suggest that most laboratory studies of allopatric speciation are also examples of peripatric speciation due to their small population sizes and the inevitable divergent selection that they undergo.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|106}} Much of the laboratory research concerning peripatry is inextricably linked to [[founder effect]] research. Coyne and Orr conclude that selection's role in speciation is well established, whereas [[genetic drift]]'s role is unsupported by experimental and field data—suggesting that founder-effect speciation does not occur.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|410}} Nevertheless, a great deal of research has been conducted on the matter, and one study conducted involving [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] populations of ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'' found evidence of isolation after a single bottleneck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Founder-Flush Speciation Theory: An Experimental Approach| author=Jeffrey R. Powell |journal=Evolution |year=1978 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=465–474 |pmid=28567948|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1978.tb04589.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Founder-Flush Speciation: An Update of Experimental Results with ''Drosophila''|author=Diane M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Proximity of blood''', or '''proximity by degree''' of [[degree of kinship|kinship]], is one of the ways to determine [[Hereditary title|hereditary]] [[Order of succession|succession]] based on [[genealogy]]. In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the [[per stirpes|right of representation]], a component of [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}}

In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, it is called the "ancient custom" ({{lang-fr|ancienne coutume}}) in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], where a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

== Examples ==
Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes.

===Successful applications===
*When [[Richard the Lionheart]] died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, [[John, King of England|John]], and his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] (the son of his second brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]]). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed.{{sfn|Barlow|1999|p=305}}

*[[Alfonso X of Castile]] wished to enforce primogeniture by the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to [[Alfonso de la Cerda|Alfonso]], the son of his deceased eldest son, [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Ferdinand]]. His second but eldest surviving son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship.{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1975|p=831}}

*In 1307 a dispute erupted over the [[County of Artois]] between [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois|Mahaut]], who had succeeded her father, [[Robert II, Count of Artois|Robert II]], in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, [[Robert III of Artois|Robert]]. Robert II had outlived his son, [[Philip of Artois|Philip]], and Mahaut put herself forward as "the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on "representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim.{{sfn|Wood|1966|p=60}}

*[[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy|Odo IV]], having outlived his son [[Philip I, Count of Auvergne|Philip]], decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, [[Joan the Lame|Joan]], rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}} Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of Odo's older sister [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by [[John II of France]], son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

*During the reign of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]], or his nephew, [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]] (the son of his deceased elder sister, [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Hedwig Sophia]]).{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=132, 393}} The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=371}} Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=}}

=== Unsuccessful applications ===

*In 1269, upon the death of [[Conrad III of Jerusalem]], [[Mary of Antioch]] and [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of [[Melisende of Lusignan|Melisende]], fifth daughter of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], while he was the grandson of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice]], second daughter of Isabella I. Mary the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the [[kings of Jerusalem]], while Hugh had precedence by [[primogeniture]] but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=328-329}}

*[[Alexander III of Scotland]] drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children.{{sfn|Duncan|2002|p=166-169}} Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], in 1290, the succession was [[Great Cause|unclear]]. [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert de Brus]] claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the [[kings of Scotland]],{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}} while [[John Balliol]] made a claim based on primogeniture.{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Robert and John were both descended from [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David of Huntingdon]] (grandson of [[David I of Scotland]]); Robert was a grandson (son of [[Isobel of Huntingdon|Isobel]], second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]], first daughter of David of Huntingdon).{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Arbitration by [[Edward I of England]] awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as [[Robert I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}}

The '''river barrier hypothesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] seeking to partially explain the high [[biodiversity|species diversity]] in the [[Amazon Basin]], first presented by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in his 1852 paper ''On Monkeys of the Amazon''.&lt;ref name= "work goddammit"&gt;Wallace, A. R. (1854). On the monkeys of the Amazon. ''Journal of Natural History'', 14(84), 451-454.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that the formation and movement of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and some of its tributaries presented a significant enough barrier to movement for wildlife populations to precipitate [[allopatric speciation]]. Facing different selection pressures and [[genetic drift]], the divided populations diverged into separate species.

There are several observable qualities that should be present if [[speciation]] has resulted from a river barrier. Divergence of species on either side of the river should increase with the size of the river, expressing weakly or not at all in the [[headwater]]s and more strongly in the wider, deeper channels further downriver. Organisms endemic to terra firme forest should be more affected than those that live in alluvial forests alongside the river, as they have a longer distance to cross before reaching appropriate habitat and lowland populations can rejoin relatively frequently when a river shifts or narrows in the early stages of [[oxbow lake]] formation. Finally, if a river barrier is the cause of speciation, sister [[species]] should exist on opposing shores more frequently than expected by random chance.

==Mechanisms==
{{references|section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Nowitna river.jpg|thumb|right|Oxbow River Formation]]
River barrier speciation occurs when a river is of sufficient size to provide a [[vicariance]] for allopatric speciation, or when the river is large enough to prevent or interfere with a genetic exchange between populations. Population division is initiated either when a river shifts into or forms within the range of a species that cannot cross it, effectively splitting the population in half, or when a small founder group is transported across an existing river through random chance. Usually a river's strength as a barrier is viewed as proportional to its width; wider rivers present a longer crossing distance and thus a greater obstacle to movement. Barrier strength varies within a given river; narrow headwaters are easier to cross than wide downstream channels. Rivers that present a barrier for some  species in a region may not necessarily do so for all, leading to species-by-species and [[clade]], or genetically distinct group, differences in degree of isolation and differentiation on opposing shores. Large mammals and birds have little trouble crossing most streams, whereas small birds unaccustomed to long distance flight can have particular difficulties and thus may be more subject to population division. Additionally, rivers more effectively divide species that prefer terra firme forest as meanders and the process of oxbow formation in [[alluvial]] regions can narrow otherwise impassable streams.

==Support==
Many research projects in the [[Amazon basin]] aimed to test the validity of the hypothesis. The [[southern chestnut-tailed antbird]] (''Myrmeciza hemimelaena'') is a species that exemplifies the hypothesis in nature. The antbirds' diversification and distribution were examined throughout the Amazon, three [[monophyletic]], genetically distinct, populations of the bird were found; two of them are currently valid subspecies. Two of the clades existed on either side of the [[Madeira River]] and the third one had a range in between the Madeira River and two small tributaries [[Ji-Paraná River|Jiparaná]] and [[Aripuanã River|Aripuanã]].&lt;ref name="fernandes"&gt;Fernandes, Alexandre M.; Wink, Michael; Aleixo, Alexandre. "Phylogeography of the chestnut-tailed antbird (Myrmeciza hemimelaena) clarifies the role of rivers in Amazonian biogeography." Journal of Biogeography 39 (2012): 1524-535.&lt;/ref&gt; This shows evidence of how these birds diversified due to possible riverine barriers, causing a limitation in gene flow. Another study found that saddle-back [[tamarin]]s follow the premise that variant gene flow occurs at different parts of a river. Gene flow was found to be restricted to the narrower headwaters of rivers, while a decrease was observed toward the mouth.&lt;ref name= "peres"&gt;Peres C.A.; Patton J.L.; Da Silva, Maria Nazareth F. "Riverine barriers and gene flow in Amazonian saddle-back tamarins." Folia Primatologica 67.3 (1996): 113-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the hypothesis. Yet, some speculate that using a single mechanism to explain diversification in the tropics would be an oversimplification. For example, there is evidence that genetic variation in the Blue-crowned [[Manakin]] may have been influenced by river barriers, Andean uplift, and range expansions.&lt;ref name="cheviron"&gt;Cheviron, Z. A.; Hackett, S. J.; Capparella, A. P. "Complex evolutionary history of a Neotropical lowland forest bird (Lepidothrix coronata) and its implications for historical hypotheses of the origin of Neotropical avian diversity" ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' 36.2 (2005): 338-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
[[File:Dendrobatid Frog, Peru, 02-02.jpg|thumb|[[Red-backed poison frog]] (''Dendrobates reticulatus'')]]
Not all studies have found support for the hypothesis. One study tested the riverine hypothesis by observing populations of four species of Amazonian frogs along the Juará River. The team expected to see gene flows of different volumes when comparing sites that were on the same bank to sites that were across the river. They found that this was not the case. [[Gene flow]] seemed to be in almost equal quantities between either set of sites.&lt;ref name="Gascon"&gt;Gascon, Claude; Lougheed, Stephen C.; Bogart, James P. "Patterns of genetic population differentiation in four species of Amazonian frogs: a test of the riverine barrier hypothesis." Biotropica 30.1 (1998): 104-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another study took the hypothesis a step further. They postulated that since rivers are supposed to be barriers for gene flow for certain taxa, then it should be a barrier at a community level. Variation in species of frogs and small mammals along and across the riverbanks of the Juará River were evaluated. No obvious gradient of decreasing similarity in species of frogs and mammals from the headwaters to the mouth of the river was found. Another discovery was the fact that there was no greater similarity between species that lived on the same bank than those that were on opposite banks of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Gascon, Claude; Malcolm, Jay R.; Patton, James L.; Bogart, James P. "Riverine barriers and the geographic distributions of Amazonian species." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97.25 (2000): 13672-3677.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These results indirectly dispute the aspects of the hypothesis that insist on speciation caused by riverine barriers. The validity of the hypothesis was tested further by examining [[poison dart frog]]s. This study (Lougheed et al.)'s results were incongruent with the hypothesis that species on either side of a river would be monophyletic relatives. The Lougheed study aimed to show that the [[ridge hypothesis]] has more credibility than the river hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Lougheed, Stephen C.; Gascon, Claude; Jones, D. A.; Bogart, James P.; Boag, Peter T. "Ridges and rivers: a test of competing hypotheses of Amazonian diversification using a dart-poison frog (Epipedobates femoralis)." Proceedings of the Royal Society 266.1421 (1999): 1829-1835.

&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-one species of nonvolent (non-flying) mammals were trapped at cross-river sites along the Juará River in another experiment. The river seemed to be a barrier for only a few taxa, with the majority either homogeneous throughout the research area or divided into monophyletic upriver and downriver clades. Patton argues that the geographic location of these clades suggest that [[landform evolution]] is an underappreciated factor in diversification in Amazonia. This project further suggests that riverine barriers are not the only mechanism for speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, James L.; Da Silva, Maria Nazareth F.; Malcolm, Jay R. “Mammals of the Rio Juruá and the evolutionary and ecological diversification of Amazonia.” Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 244 (2000): 1-306
&lt;/ref&gt; 

All these critics argue that other factors influence speciation in Amazonia. Another shortcoming of the hypothesis is that it has been researched mostly in Amazonia, rather than in other river basins. Also, shifts of rivers may prevent the establishment of any patterns across rivers, further complicating means to test for the strength of the hypothesis.{{fact|date=July 2015}}

A '''social edition''' is a form of textual scholarship that utilizes social media like Wikimedia or blogs to create annotated editions of texts. [[Constance Crompton|Crompton]], [[Alyssa Arbuckle|Arbuckle]] and [[Ray Siemens|Siemens]] describe that "Using social media allows us to integrate a new stage into the editorial process — a stage that fills the gap between an edition’s initial planning stages and its concluding blind peer review, which capitalizes on the engaged knowledge communities inside and outside the academy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/viewFile/118/268 "Understanding the Social Edition Through Iterative Implementation: The Case of the Devonshire MS (BL Add MS 17492),"] with Constance Crompton, Alyssa Arbuckle, and the Devonshire MS Editorial Group. ''Scholarly and Research Communication'' 4.2 (2013). 9 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Studies in Comparative Religion''''' was a quarterly [[academic journal]] published from 1963 to 1987 that contained essays on the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices and [[religious symbolism]] of the world's religions. The journal was notable for the number of prominent [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] who contributed to it. It was also notable for being the first [[English language|English-language]] journal focused on the subject of traditional studies and [[comparative religion]].

== History ==
The journal was established in 1963 by [[Francis Clive-Ross]], who also served as [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher. From 1963 to 1967 the journal was published under the name ''Tomorrow''. Perennialist author [[William Stoddart]] also served as an assistant editor for many years. [[Jacob Needleman]], editor of ''The Penguin Metaphysical Library'', published a collection of essays from ''Studies in Comparative Religion'' under the title "The Sword of Gnosis". The journal ceased publication in 1987 and the articles were unavailable until 2007, when [[World Wisdom]] launched a free on-line [[archive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">The '''Survey of English Usage''' was the first research centre in Europe to carry out research with [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]]. The Survey is based in the Department of English Language and Literature at [[University College London]].

== History ==

The Survey of English Usage was founded in 1959 by [[Randolph Quirk|Randolph (now Lord) Quirk]]. Many well-known linguists have spent time doing research at the Survey, including Bas Aarts, Valerie Adams, John Algeo, Dwight Bolinger, Noël Burton-Roberts, [[David Crystal]], Derek Davy, Jan Firbas, [[Sidney Greenbaum]], Liliane Haegeman, Robert Ilson, Ruth Kempson, [[Geoffrey Leech]], Jan Rusiecki, Jan Svartvik, and Joe Taglicht. The current Director is Bas Aarts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Survey Staff | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/staff/index.htm | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=14 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Survey Corpus''' predated modern computing. It was recorded on reel-to-reel tapes, transcribed on paper, filed in filing cabinets, and indexed on paper cards. Transcriptions were annotated with a detailed [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] and [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] annotation developed by Crystal and Quirk (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David, and Quirk, Randolph (1964). ''Systems of Prosodic and Paralinguistic Features in English''. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of paper cards were manually annotated for grammatical structures and filed, so, for example, all noun phrases could be found in the noun phrase filing cabinet in the Survey. Naturally, corpus searches required a visit to the Survey.

This corpus is now known more widely as the '''London-Lund Corpus''' (LLC), as it was the responsibility of co-workers in Lund, Sweden, to computerise the corpus. Thirty-four of the spoken texts were published in book form as Svartvik and Quirk (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Svartvik, Jan and Quirk, Randolph (1980) (eds.). ''A Corpus of English Conversation'' Lund: CWK Gleerup.&lt;/ref&gt; and the corpus was used as the basis for the famous ''Comprehensive Grammar'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Randolph, Greenbaum, Sidney, Leech, Geoffrey and Svartvik, Jan (1985). ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

=== Constructing corpora ===

In 1988 Sidney Greenbaum proposed a new project, '''ICE''', the [[International Corpus of English]]. ICE was to be an international project, carried out at research centres around the world, to compile corpora of English varieties where English was the first or second official language. ICE texts would contain spoken and written English in a balanced sample of one million words per component so that these samples could be compared in a wide varieties of ways. The ICE project continues around the world to the present day.

'''ICE-GB''', the British Component of ICE, was compiled at the Survey. ICE-GB was annotated to a very detailed level, including constructing a full grammatical analysis (parse) for every sentence in the corpus. The first release of ICE-GB took place in 1998. ICE-GB was distributed with software for searching and exploring the [[parsed corpus]] called ICECUP. Release 2 of ICE-GB has now been released and is available on CD.

As well as contrasting varieties of English, many researchers are interested in language development and change over time. A recent project at the Survey undertook the parsing of a large (400,000 word) selection of the spoken part of the LLC in a manner directly comparable with ICE-GB, forming a new, 800,000 word diachronic corpus, called the  Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English ('''DCPSE'''). DCPSE has now been released and is available on CD from the Survey.

These two corpora comprise the largest collection of parsed and corrected, orthographically transcribed spoken English language data in the world, with over one million words of spoken English in this form.

=== Exploring corpora ===

[[Treebank|Parsed corpora]] are large databases containing detailed grammatical tree structures. One of the consequences of forming large collections of valuable linguistic data is a pressing need for methods and tools to help researchers and other users make the most of them. So in parallel with the parsing of natural language data, the Survey team have carried out research and development of software tools to help linguists use these corpora. The ICECUP research platform uses an intuitive grammatical query representation called Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs) to search parsed corpora.

=== Linguistic research with corpora ===

As well as distributing corpora and tools to the [[corpus linguistics]] research community, the SEU carries out research into English language. Recent projects include research on the English Noun Phrase, Subordination in Spoken and Written English, and the English Verb Phrase. The Survey also provides support for PhD students who carry out research into English language corpora.

'''''The Religion of the Future''''' is a book by the philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls "deep freedom"—a life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection—protected by structure-revising social and political structures of an [[empowered democracy]] hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life.

==Overview==

===Background and objective===
Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three “moments” in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This “religion of the future” would offer a way of confronting life without illusions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=1-61}}

In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future.

===Critique of religious tradition of "overcoming the world"===
The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that “overcoming the world” cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=62-89}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "humanizing the world"===
The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by [[Confucianism]]) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=90-120}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "struggling with the world"===
According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of “struggling with the world,” the semitic salvific religions including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The tradition of “struggling with the world” also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[democracy]]. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of “struggling with the world” include several points in common:
* There is one real world.
* Time is inclusively real.
* The new can happen.
* History is open.
* The self has unfathomable depth.
* The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown.

At the heart of the doctrine of the “struggle with the world,” both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: “There is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.” Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not “ever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.”

This view of human nature as irrepressibly context-transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=121-195}}

===Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future===
Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities:
* It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history.
* It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life.
* It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula.
* It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time.
* It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=194-289}}

===Unger's conception of "deep freedom" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about===
Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of “structure-revising structure,” and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger’s vision for politics in this chapter includes “heating up” the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=290-340}}

===Quality of human life under the religion of the future===
Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=341-444}}

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Andrew B. Irvine wrote that “the book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today …  No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated—and criticized.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=554}} Irvine contends that Unger’s argument  “dramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine asks: “What would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger’s exclusivistic affirmation of the ‘struggle with the world’ seems insufficiently informed.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine concludes his review by applauding ''The Religion of the Future'', stating that it “merits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=568}}

Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication ''Dominicana'', described ''The Religion of the Future'' as “a prophetic vision of any future religion,”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=11}} and stated that he considered the book, alongside [[Ronald Dworkin]]’s ''Religion Without God'', to be an example of “religious atheism,” that is, a “new attitude to God” that “presents a new horizon for Christianity.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}} While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a “maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}}

Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'', Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' and concluded in ''[[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time]]''. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger’s project in these works as one that “seeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation” (internal citations omitted). Bendik-Keymer complains that Unger’s depiction of human beings is “belittling” and concludes that Unger “has simply missed the mark… Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.”{{sfn|Bendik-Keymer|2014}}

==Quotes==

- p.236

{{quote|The category of religion lacks any permanent core. There is no set way in which the aspects of our experience that we designate as religious relate to other aspects. That the category of religion is historical, however, does not mean that it is empty of content. Its powers of discrimination are those that the history of mankind gives it. Each major change in the content of religion inspires a change in our idea of what the term most usefully designates.}}

- p.314

{{quote|Deep freedom is therefore freedom, grasped and realized through change of institutions and practices: not just through a one-time change but through a practice that can generate future, ongoing change in the institutional order of society. Deep freedom is thus also freedom as understood within the bounds of what I earlier described as the conception of a free society. The idea of deep freedom develops through an interplay between the conception of a free society and the institutional arrangements required to make that conception real. The conception informs the making of the institutional alternatives. The making of the alternative prompts us to enrich and revise the conception.}}

- p.349

{{quote|Our comprehensive conceptions of our identity, viewed in relation to our place in nature, are not, in this account, to be understood as merely or chiefly conjectures about a natural phenomenon, as if human nature were a thing. They do not resemble the thinking that produced the standard model of particle physics or the periodic table. They are prophecies, indeed imperfectly self-fulfilling prophecies, as I have argued in my defense of the concept of religion.}}

Globally sex workers encounter barriers in accessing health care, legislation, legal resources and labor rights. In a study of U.S sex workers, 43% of interviews showed reports of [[Intimate partner violence|intimate-partner violence]], physical violence, armed physical violence, and [[sexual violence]] in the forms of sexual coercion and rape&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Decker|first=Michele R|last2=Pearson|first2=Erin|last3=Illangasekare|first3=Samantha L|last4=Clark|first4=Erin|last5=Sherman|first5=Susan G|date=2013-09-23|title=Violence against women in sex work and HIV risk implications differ qualitatively by perpetrator|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=13|issue=1|pages=876|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-876|pmid=24060235|pmc=3852292|issn=1471-2458}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
