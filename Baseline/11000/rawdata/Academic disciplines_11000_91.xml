[[File:Africa (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Africa]]
'''African studies''' is the study of [[Africa]], especially the continent's cultures and societies (as opposed to its geology, geography, zoology, etc.). The field includes the study of Africa's [[history of Africa|history]] (Pre-colonial, [[colonisation of Africa|colonial]], [[decolonization of Africa|post-colonial]]), [[demographics of Africa|demography]] ([[ethnic groups in Africa|ethnic groups]]), [[culture of Africa|culture]], [[politics of Africa|politics]], [[economy of Africa|economy]], [[languages of Africa|languages]], and [[religion in Africa|religion]] ([[Islam in Africa|Islam]], [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]], [[Traditional African religion|traditional religions]]). A specialist in African studies is often referred to as an "Africanist". A key focus of the discipline is to interrogate [[epistemology|epistemological]] approaches, theories and methods in traditional disciplines using a critical lens that inserts African-centred ways of knowing and references.

For Africanists, also known as communitarians, problems within Africa are thought to be caused because the real flesh-and-blood communities that comprise Africa are marginalized from public life as so many "[[tribe]]s". Therefore, the solution is understood to be the need to defend culture and put Africa's age-old communities at the center of African politics. It is also argued that there is a need to "deexoticize" Africa and banalise it, rather than understand Africa as exceptionalized and exoticized.&lt;ref name=Mamdani&gt;Mamdani, M. (1996), Chapter 1 from Mamdani, M., ''Citizen and Subject: contemporary Africa and the legacy of late colonialism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''authority''' of a text is its reliability as a witness to the author's intentions. These intentions could be initial, medial or final, but intentionalist editors (most notably represented by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] editing school) generally attempt to retrieve final authorial intentions. The concept is of particular importance for textual critics, whether they believe that authorial intention is recoverable, or whether they think that this recovery is impossible. 

Here are some examples of authority:

* The only authority for the works of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Catullus]] derives from a lost manuscript, of which three copies reside in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris, the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome (the ''Codex Vaticanus''). No one knows, or can ever know, how close this manuscript comes to [[Catullus]]' intentions—in other words, how great its authority is.
* It is generally thought that the Q1 ('[[Bad quarto]]') edition of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an [[copyright infringement|unauthorized]] copy, reconstructed from memory by one of the actors. If this is so, then it has some authority, but much less than the first authorized quarto, Q2 (1602). In comparison, however, it might be a useful authority to the cuts and adaptations made in the performance it was based on.
* The [[First Folio]] edition of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1623) is the only authoritative source, since it is the copy-text of all future editions.
* A diary which is probably authentic has total authority.

A text's authority is made more problematic when it has more than one author, when it falsely asserts itself to be someone else's work, or when it is revised many times. For instance:

* The forged [[Hitler Diaries|diaries]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] have no authority as the work of their supposed author, but they do have authority as a witness to the intentions of [[Konrad Kujau]], the forger.
* A page on Wikipedia could be said to indicate the intentions of the aggregate of users who have edited it up to that point: it has multiple authority. But many of its editors will disagree with one another about what the page should contain. The idea of 'final intention' does not easily apply, since the page is never complete, and since a recent change (e.g. a piece of vandalism) might not be satisfactory to any of the other editors except the one who made it.
* The [[quarto]] edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]] differs from the later [[folio (printing)|folio]] edition in many ways. Most modern versions collate the two, preferring one edition in one passage and the other in another. But some editors, such as [[Stanley Wells]], argue they are separate works with different artistic intentions, and that neither of them has more authority.

Authority can also be related to a particular edition, especially if this edition reaches a degree of popularity.

Independently, biochar can increase [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] of [[acidic soil]]s (low pH soils), increase agricultural productivity, and provide protection against some foliar and soil-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biochar.org/joomla/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=24 |title= Slash and Char |accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The word "biochar" is a combination of "bio-" as in "biomass" and "char" as in "charcoal".&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite OED | biochar }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been used in scientific literature of the 20th and 21st century.

[[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]]s are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity. They seem to have produced it by [[smolder]]ing agricultural waste (i.e., covering burning biomass with soil)&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Dawit, Johannes Lehmann, Janice Thies, Thorsten Schafer, Biqing Liang, James Kinyangi, Eduardo Neves, James Petersen, Flavio Luizao, and Jan Skjemstad, ''Molecular signature and sources of biochemical recalcitrance of organic carbon in Amazonian Dark Earths'', 71 Geochemica et cosmochemica ACTA 2285, 2286 (2007) ("Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) are a unique type of soils apparently developed between 500 and 9000 years B.P. through intense anthropogenic activities such as biomass-burning and high-intensity nutrient depositions on pre-Columbian Amerindian settlements that transformed the original soils into Fimic Anthrosols throughout the Brazilian Amazon Basin.") (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; in pits or trenches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007a|pp=381–387}} Similar soils are found, more scarcely, elsewhere in the world.  To date, scientists have been unable to completely reproduce the beneficial growth properties of ''terra preta''. It is hypothesized that part of the alleged benefits of ''terra preta'' require the biochar to be aged so that it increases the cation exchange capacity of the soil, among other possible effects. In fact, there is no evidence natives made biochar for soil treatment, but rather for transportable fuel charcoal; there is little evidence for any hypothesis accounting for the frequency and location of terra preta patches in Amazonia. Abandoned or forgotten charcoal pits left for centuries were eventually reclaimed by the forest. In that time, the initially harsh negative effects of the char (high pH, extreme ash content, salinity) wore off and turned positive as the forest soil ecosystem saturated the charcoals with nutrients. ''supra'' note 2 at 386 ("Only aged biochar shows high cation retention, as in Amazonian Dark Earths. At high temperatures (30–70°C), cation retention occurs within a few months. The production method that would attain high CEC in soil in cold climates is not currently known.") (internal citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; European settlers called it ''[[Terra preta|terra preta de Indio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glaser|Lehmann|Zech|2002|pp=219–220}} "These so-called Terra Preta do Indio (Terra Preta) characterize the settlements of pre-Columbian Indios. In Terra Preta soils large amounts of black C indicate a high and prolonged input of carbonized organic matter probably due to the production of charcoal in hearths, whereas only low amounts of charcoal are added to soils as a result of forest fires and slash-and-burn techniques." (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;
Following observations and experiments, a research team working in [[French Guiana]] hypothesized that the Amazonian [[earthworm]] ''[[Pontoscolex corethrurus]]'' was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris to the mineral soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jean-François Ponge |author2=Stéphanie Topoliantz |author3=Sylvain Ballof |author4=Jean-Pierre Rossi |author5=Patrick Lavelle |author6=Jean-Marie Betsch |author7=Philippe Gaucher |year=2006 |title=Ingestion of charcoal by the Amazonian earthworm ''Pontoscolex corethrurus'': a potential for tropical soil fertility |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=2008–2009 |doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.12.024 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44735820 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Biochar is a high-carbon, fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern [[pyrolysis]] processes; it is the direct [[thermal decomposition]] of biomass in the absence of [[oxygen]] (preventing [[combustion]]), which produces a mixture of solids (the biochar proper), liquid ([[Pyrolysis oil|bio-oil]]), and gas ([[syngas]]) products. The specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process condition, such as temperature, and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaunt|Lehmann|2008|pp=4152, 4155}} ("Assuming that the energy in syngas is converted to electricity with an efficiency of 35%, the recovery in the life cycle energy balance ranges from 92 to 274&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MWn&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of electricity generated where the pyrolysis process is optimized for energy and 120 to 360&amp;nbsp;kg {{co2}} MWn&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; where biochar is applied to land. This compares to emissions of 600–900&amp;nbsp;kg {{chem|CO|2}} MWh&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for fossil-fuel-based technologies.)&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures of {{convert|400|-|500|C|K}} produce more [[char]], while temperatures above {{convert|700|C|K}} favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components.&lt;ref name=Winsley1&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Winsley |first=Peter |title=Biochar and bioenergy production for climate change mitigation |volume=64
| journal=[[New Zealand Science Review]]|year=2007}} (See Table 1 for differences in output for Fast, Intermediate, Slow, and Gasification).&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds instead of hours. Typical yields are 60% [[bio-oil]], 20% biochar, and 20% syngas. By comparison, slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (~50%); it is this which contributes to the observed soil fertility of [[terra preta]]. Once initialized, both processes produce net energy. For typical inputs, the energy required to run a “fast” pyrolyzer is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laird|2008|pp=100, 178–181}} "The energy required to operate a fast pyrolyzer is ∼15% of the total energy that can be derived from the dry biomass. Modern systems are designed to use the syngas generated by the pyrolyzer to provide all the energy needs of the pyrolyzer."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3–9 times the amount of energy required to run.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;

The Amazonian pit/trench method&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas, and releases a large amount of {{CO2}}, [[black carbon]], and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) (and potentially, [[toxin]]s) into the air. Commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste, paper byproducts, and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products.  The production of biochar as an output is not a priority in most cases.

=== Centralized, decentralized, and mobile systems ===

In a centralized system, all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant for processing. Alternatively, each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower-tech [[kiln]]. Finally, a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass. Vehicle power comes from the [[syngas]] stream, while the biochar remains on the farm. The [[biofuel]] is sent to a refinery or storage site. Factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts, the amount of material to be processed, and the ability to feed directly into the power grid.

For crops that are not exclusively for biochar production, the [[Residue-to-Product Ratio (RPR)]] and the collection factor (CF) the percent of the residue not used for other things, measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product. For instance, [[Brazil]] harvests approximately 460 million tons (MT) of [[sugarcane]] annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=FAOSTAT | year=2006 | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 | accessdate=1 July 2008 | title=Production Quantity Of Sugar Cane In Brazil In 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906230329/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 | archivedate=6 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an RPR of 0.30, and a CF of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops, which normally are burned in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Perera, K.K.C.K., P.G. Rathnasiri, S.A.S. Senarath, A.G.T. Sugathapala, S.C. Bhattacharya, and P. Abdul Salam, ''Assessment of sustainable energy potential of non-plantation biomass resources in Sri'' Lanka, 29 Biomass &amp; Bioenergy 199, 204 (2005) (showing RPRs for numerous plants, describing method for determining available agricultural waste for energy and char production).&lt;/ref&gt; This translates into approximately 100 MT of residue annually, which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives. Adding in the [[bagasse]] (sugarcane waste) (RPR=0.29 CF=1.0), which is otherwise burned (inefficiently) in boilers, raises the total to 230 MT of pyrolysis feedstock. Some plant residue, however, must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laird|2008|pp= 179}} "Much of the current scientific debate on the harvesting of biomass for bioenergy is focused on how much can be harvested without doing too much damage."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Carbon sink ===
{{See also|Climate engineering}}

The burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of {{chem|CO|2}} to the atmosphere. Biochar is a stable way of storing carbon in the ground for centuries, potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels; at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality, increase soil fertility, raise agricultural productivity, and reduce pressure on [[old-growth forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laird|2008|pp=100, 178–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years, like [[coal]].&lt;ref name="Terra Preta de Indio"&gt;{{cite journal

This technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as [[James Hansen]], head of the [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/654444 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Sole option is to adapt, climate author says | first=Tyler | last=Hamilton | date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lovelock]], creator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], for [[mitigation of global warming]] by [[greenhouse gas remediation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vince|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide ({{chem|CO|2}}), methane, and nitrous oxide by up to 1.8 Pg [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{chem|CO|2}}-C equivalent]] ({{chem|CO|2}}-C&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) per year (12% of current anthropogenic {{chem|CO|2}}-C&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; emissions; 1 Pg=1 Gt), and total net emissions over the course of the next century by 130 Pg {{chem|CO|2}}-C&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, without endangering food security, habitat, or soil conservation.&lt;ref name="Sustainable biochar to mitigate global climate change"&gt;{{cite web

=== Soil amendment ===

Biochar is recognized as offering a number of benefits for [[soil health]].  Many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar.  This structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients.  Soil biologist [[Elaine Ingham]] indicates&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, Elaine ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150217052426/http://www.needfire.info/home/interview-with-dr-elaine-ingham |Interview with Elaine Ingham]'', (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil [[soil biology|micro organisms]].  She points out that when pre-charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil, and in turn plant, health.

Biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of ''[[Escherichia coli|E-coli]]'' through sandy soils depending on application rate, feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, soil moisture content, soil texture, and surface properties of the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bolster | first1 = C.H. | last2 = Abit | first2 = S.M. | year = 2012 | title = Biochar pyrolyzed at two temperatures affects Escherichia coli transport through a sandy soil | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 124–133 | doi=10.2134/jeq2011.0207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abit | first1 = S.M. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = C.H. | last3 = Cai | first3 = P. | last4 = Walker | first4 = S.L. | year = 2012 | title = Influence of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature of biochar amendments on transport of Escherichia coli in saturated and unsaturated soil | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 46 | issue = 15| pages = 8097–8105 | doi=10.1021/es300797z| bibcode = 2012EnST...46.8097A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abit | first1 = S.M. | last2 = Bolster | first2 = C.H. | last3 = Cantrell | first3 = K.B. | last4 = Flores | first4 = J.Q. | last5 = Walker | first5 = S.L. | year = 2014 | title = Transport of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and microspheres in biochar-amended soils with different textures | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 371–378 | doi=10.2134/jeq2013.06.0236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slash-and-char ===

Switching from ''[[slash-and-burn]]'' to ''[[slash-and-char]]'' farming techniques in Brazil can decrease both deforestation of the [[Amazon basin]] and carbon dioxide emission, as well as increase crop yields. Slash-and-burn leaves only 3% of the carbon from the organic material in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glaser|Lehmann|Zech|2002|pp=note 7 at 225}} "The published data average at about 3% charcoal formation of the original biomass C."&lt;/ref&gt;

Slash-and-char can keep up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.&lt;ref&gt;''Biochar Sequestration In Terrestrial Ecosystems – A Review'', by Johannes Lehmann, John Gaunt, and Marco Rondon. Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global change 403, 404 (2006). ''supra'' note 11 at 407 ("If this woody above ground biomass were converted into biochar by means of simple kiln techniques and applied to soil, more than 50% of this carbon would be sequestered in a highly stable form.")&lt;/ref&gt; Returning the biochar into the soil rather than removing it all for energy production reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizers, thereby reducing cost and emissions from fertilizer production and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaunt|Lehmann|2008|pp=4152}} note 3 ("This results in increased crop yields in low-input agriculture and increased crop yield per unit of fertilizer applied (fertilizer efficiency) in [[Intensive farming|high-input agriculture]] as well as reductions in off-site effects such as runoff, erosion, and gaseous losses.")&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by improving the soil's ability to be tilled, fertility, and productivity, biochar–enhanced soils can indefinitely sustain agricultural production, whereas non-enriched soils quickly become depleted of nutrients, forcing farmers to abandon the fields, producing a continuous slash and burn cycle and the continued loss of [[tropical rainforest]]. Using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for [[cellulosic ethanol]] does. Additionally, the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|2007b|pp=note 9 at 143}} "It can be mixed with manures or fertilizers and included in no-tillage methods, without the need for additional equipment."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water retention ===

Biochar is [[hygroscopic]]. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its porous structure and high surface area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf Terra Pretas: Charcoal Amendments Influence on Relict Soils and Modern Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, nutrients, phosphorus, and agrochemicals are retained for the plants benefit. Plants are therefore healthier, and less fertilizer leaches into surface or groundwater.

=== Energy production: Bio-oil and Syngas ===
{{main article|Biofuel}}
Mobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badger|Fransham|2006|pp= 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobson, Cedric Briens and Franco Berruti, "Lift tube technology for increasing heat transfer in an annular pyrolysis reactor", CFB’9, Hamburg, Germany, 13–16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers, has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition, and, unless carefully cleaned, contains some biochar particles which can block injectors.&lt;ref&gt;Yaman, Serdar, ''pyrolysis of biomass to produce fuels and chemical feedstocks'', 45 Energy Conversion &amp; MGMT 651, 659 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is less suitable for use as a kind of [[biodiesel]] than other sources.

If biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment, it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal. Pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of [[electricity generation]] from biomaterial.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgwater, A. V., A.J. Toft, and J.G. Brammer, ''A techno-economic comparison of power production by biomass fast pyrolysis with gasification and combustion'', 6 Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Rev. 181, 231 ("the fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system is clearly the most economic of the novel systems at scales up to 15 MWe")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct and indirect benefits ==
&lt;!--This section should be merged into above sections:--&gt;
* The pyrolysis of forest- or agriculture-derived biomass residue generates a biofuel without competition with crop production.
* Biochar is a pyrolysis byproduct that may be ploughed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability, and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils. It has meant a remarkable improvement in tropical soils showing positive effects in increasing soil fertility and in improving disease resistance in West European Soils.&lt;ref name="socialimpact00544" /&gt;
* Biochar enhances the natural process: the biosphere captures {{chem|CO|2}}, especially through plant production, but only a small portion is stably sequestered for a relatively long time (soil, wood, etc.).
* Biomass production to obtain biofuels and biochar for carbon sequestration in the soil is a carbon-negative process, i.e. more {{chem|CO|2}} is removed from the atmosphere than released, thus enabling long-term sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;Cornet A., Escadafal R., 2009.

== Research ==

Intensive research into manifold aspects involving the pyrolysis/biochar platform is underway around the world. From 2005 to 2012, there were 1,038 articles that included the word “biochar” or “bio-char” in the topic that had been indexed in the ISI Web of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verheijen | first1 = F.G.A. | last2 = Graber | first2 = E.R. | last3 = Ameloot | first3 = N. | last4 = Bastos | first4 = A.C. | last5 = Sohi | first5 = S. | last6 = Knicker | first6 = H. | year = 2014 | title = Biochars in soils: new insights and emerging research needs | url = | journal = Eur.

Long-term effect of biochar on soil C sequestration of recent carbon inputs has been examined using soil from arable fields in Belgium with charcoal-enriched black spots dating &gt;150 years ago from historical charcoal production mound kilns. Topsoils from these ‘black spots’ had a higher organic C concentration [3.6 ± 0.9% organic carbon (OC)] than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2.1 ± 0.2% OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (δ13C) −13.1, distinct from the δ13C of soil organic carbon (−27.4 ‰) and charcoal (−25.7 ‰) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize-derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal-amended samples (‘black spots’) than in adjacent unamended ones (0.44% vs. 0.31%; P = 0.02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two ‘black spots’ along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration, and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal, but the maize-derived C respiration per unit maize-derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half (P &lt; 0.02) with increasing charcoal-derived C in soil. Maize-derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection, C saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12250/full Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2015]).

Biochar sequesters carbon (C) in soils because of its prolonged residence time, ranging from several years to millennia. In addition, biochar can promote indirect C-sequestration by increasing crop yield while, potentially, reducing C-mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C-mineralization using 13C isotope signatures. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715312614 (Kerre et al, 2016)]

Fluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic-like fluorescent component, likely associated with biochar-carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy-microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic-carbon in discrete spots in the solid-phase of microaggregates and its co-localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co-localization of aromatic-C:polysaccharides-C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar-amended soils [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25127 (Hernandez-Soriano ''et al'', 2016)]

== Possible commercial sector ==
If biomass is pyrolyzed to biochar and put back into the soil, rather than being completely burned, this may reduce carbon emissions. Potentially, the bioenergy industry might even be made to sequester net carbon.{{sfn|Lehmann|2007b|pp=143, 144}} Pyrolysis might be cost-effective for a combination of sequestration and energy production when the cost of a {{chem|CO|2}} ton reaches $37.{{sfn|Lehmann|2007b|pp=143, 144}}

Current biochar projects make no significant impact on the overall global carbon budget, although expansion of this technique has been advocated as a [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14851 Ananthaswamy, Anil, ''Microwave factory to act as carbon sink'', ''New Scientist'', 1 October (2008) ("Retrieved on 12 December 2008)]&lt;br/&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7924373.stm ''Biochar: Is the hype justified?''] By Roger Harrabin - Environment analyst, (09:20 GMT, Monday, 16 March 2009) BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the Biochar Fund, a small "social profit organization", received a grant from the [[Congo Basin Forest Fund]] for a project in [[Central Africa]] to simultaneously slow down [[deforestation]], increase the [[food security]] of rural communities, provide [[renewable energy]] and sequester carbon. Though some farmers did report better maize crops, the project ended early without significant results and with promises to the farmers not kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Biochar-Cameroon-report1.pdf |title=Biochar Fund Trials in Cameroon: Hype and Unfulfilled Promises |author=Benoit Anthony Ndameu |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Biofuelwatch]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application rates of {{convert|2.5|-|20|tonne/ha}} appear to be required to produce significant improvements in plant yields. Biochar costs in developed countries vary from $300–7000/tonne, generally too high for the farmer/horticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops. In developing countries, constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time. An alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar-fertilizer complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, S., Graber, E.R., Chia, C., Munroe, P., Donne, S., Thomas, T., Nielsen, S., Marjo, C., Rutlidge, H., Pan, GX., Li, L., Taylor, P., Rawal, A., Hook, J.

[[File:English Daisy (Bellis Perennis).jpg|thumb|right|233px|''[[Bellis perennis]]'' has one botanical name and many common names, including perennial daisy, lawn daisy, common daisy, and English daisy.]]
A '''botanical name''' is a formal [[scientific name]] conforming to the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN) and, if it concerns a plant [[cultigen]], the additional [[cultivar]] or [[cultivar group|Group]] epithets must conform to the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP). The code of nomenclature covers "all organisms traditionally treated as algae, [[Fungus|fungi]], or plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, including blue-green algae ([[Cyanobacteria]]), [[Chytridiomycota|chytrids]], [[oomycete]]s, [[slime moulds]] and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s with their taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups (but excluding [[Microsporidia]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name that is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name ''[[Bellis perennis]]'' denotes a plant species which is native to most of the countries of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], where it has accumulated various names in many languages. Later, the plant was introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages. English names for this plant species include: daisy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoflora.co.uk/search_species2.php?plant_no=1690050020 Ecological Flora of the British Isles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312061456/http://www.ecoflora.co.uk/search_species2.php?plant_no=1690050020 |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; English daisy,&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | ''Bellis perennis'' | 6728 | accessdate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lawn daisy.&lt;ref name="McCarty2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=L.

==Type specimens and circumscription==
The botanical name itself is fixed by a [[type (botany)|type]], which is a particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular taxon.

The usefulness of botanical names is limited by the fact that taxonomic groups are not fixed in size; a taxon may have a varying [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]],  depending on the [[wiktionary:taxonomic system|taxonomic system]], thus, the group that a particular botanical name refers to can be quite small according to some people and quite big according to others. For example, the traditional view of the family [[Malvaceae]] has been expanded in some modern approaches to include what were formerly considered to be several closely related families. Some botanical names refer to groups that are very stable (for example [[Equisetaceae]], [[Magnoliaceae]]) while for other names a careful check is needed to see which circumscription is being used (for example [[Fabaceae]], [[Amygdaloideae]], ''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'').

==Forms of plant names==
Depending on [[rank (botany)|rank]], botanical names may be in one part ([[genus]] and above), two parts (various situations below the rank of genus) or [[Infraspecific name (botany)|three parts]] (below the rank of species). The names of cultivated plants are not necessarily similar to the botanical names, since they may instead involve "unambiguous common names" of species or genera. Cultivated plant names may also have an extra component, bringing a maximum of four parts:

;in one part
:[[Plant]]ae (the plants)
:[[Marchantiophyta]] (the liverworts)
:[[Dicotyledon|Magnoliopsida]] (class including the family [[Magnoliaceae]])
:[[Liliidae]] (subclass including the family [[Liliaceae]])
:[[Pinophyta]] (the [[conifers]])
:[[Fagaceae]] (the [[beech]] family)
:''[[birch|Betula]]'' (the [[birch]] genus)

;in two parts
:''[[Acacia]]'' subg. ''Phyllodineae'' (the wattles)
:''[[lchemilla]]'' subsect. ''Heliodrosium''
:''[[Berberis thunbergii]]'' (Japanese barberry) a species name, i.e., a '''combination''' consisting of a genus name and one epithet
:''[[Syringa]]'' 'Charisma' – a cultivar within a genus
:''Hydrangea'' Lacecap Group – a genus name and Group epithet
:''Lilium'' Darkest Red Group – a genus name and Group epithet
:''Paphiopedilum'' Greenteaicecreamandraspberries grex
:snowdrop 'John Gray' – an unambiguous common name for the genus ''Galanthus'' and a cultivar epithet

;in three parts:
:''[[Calystegia sepium]]'' subsp. ''americana'' (American hedge bindweed), a combination consisting of a genus name and two epithets
:''[[Crataegus azarolus]]'' var. ''pontica'' (a Mediterranean hawthorn)
:''[[Bellis perennis]]'' 'Aucubifolia' – a cultivar
:''Brassica oleracea'' Gemmifera Group – a species name and Group epithet

;in four parts:
:''Scilla hispanica'' var. ''campanulata'' 'Rose Queen' – a cultivar within a botanical variety
:apart from cultivars, the name of a plant can never have more than three parts.

==Components of plant names==
A botanical name in three parts, i.e., an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]] (a name for a taxon below the rank of species) needs a "connecting term" to indicate rank. In the ''Calystegia'' example above, this is "subsp.", for [[subspecies]]. In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this "connecting term" is not used in zoology). A name of a "subdivision of a genus" also needs a connecting term (in the ''Acacia'' example above, this is "subg.", [[subgenus]]). The connecting term is not part of the name itself.

A taxon may be indicated by a listing in more than three parts: "''Saxifraga aizoon'' var. ''aizoon'' subvar. ''brevifolia'' f. ''multicaulis'' subf. ''surculosa'' Engl. &amp; Irmsch." but this is a classification, not a formal botanical name. The botanical name is ''Saxifraga aizoon'' subf. ''surculosa'' Engl. &amp; Irmsch. (''ICN'' Art 24: Ex 1).

Generic, specific, and infraspecific botanical names are usually printed in [[italics]]. The example set by the ''ICN'' is to italicize all botanical names, including those above genus, though the ''ICN'' preface states: "The ''Code'' sets no binding standard in this respect, as typography is a matter of editorial style and tradition not of nomenclature". Most peer-reviewed scientific botanical publications do not italicize names above the rank of genus, and non-botanical scientific publications do not, which is in keeping with two of the three other kinds of [[scientific name]]: [[zoological nomenclature|zoological]] and [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria|bacterial]] ([[virus classification|viral names]] above genus are italicized, a new policy adopted in the early 1990s).

For botanical nomenclature, the ''ICN'' prescribes a two-part name or '''binary name''' for any taxon below the [[rank (botany)|rank]] of genus down to, and including the rank of species. Taxa below the rank of species get a three part ([[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]).

A binary name consists of the name of a [[genus]] and an epithet.

* In the case of a species this is a specific epithet:
:''[[Bellis perennis]]'' is the name of a species, in which ''perennis'' is the specific epithet. There is no connecting term involved, to indicate the rank.

* In the case of a subdivision of a genus (subgenus, section, subsection, series, subseries, etc.) the name consists of the name of a genus and a subdivisional epithet. A connecting term should be placed before the subdivisional epithet to indicate the rank: 
:''Paraserianthes'' sect. ''Falcataria''

In the case of cultivated plants, there is an additional epithet which is an often non-Latin part, not written in italics. For cultivars, it is always given in single quotation marks. The cultivar, Group, or grex epithet may follow either the botanical name of the species, or the name of the genus only, or the unambiguous common name of the genus or species. The generic name, followed by a cultivar name, is often used when the parentage of a particular hybrid cultivar is not relevant in the context, or is uncertain.

The '''Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar)''' is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that studies the species diversity of one of the largest and most inaccessible environments on the planet, the [[abyssal plain]].  CeDAMar uses data to create an estimation of global species diversity and provide a better understanding of the history of deep-sea fauna, including its present diversity and dependence on environmental parameters.  CeDAMar initiatives aim to identify centers of high biodiversity useful for planning both commercial and conservation efforts, and are able to be used in future studies on the effects of climate change on the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coml.org/projects/census-diversity-abyssal-marine-life-cedamar CeDAMar on COML]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2009, participation by upwards of 56 institutions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedamar.org/Participating-Institutes&lt;/ref&gt; in 17 countries has resulted in the publication of nearly 300 papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedamar.org/Publication-list CeDAMar]&lt;/ref&gt;  Results of CeDAMar-related research were also published in a 2010 textbook on deep-sea biodiversity by Michael Rex and Ron Etter, members of CeDAMar's Scientific Steering Committee.({{ISBN|978-0674036079}})

CeDAMar is led by Dr. Pedro Martinez Arbizu of Germany and Dr. Craig Smith, USA.

The '''Centro de Relaciones Internacionales''' ('''CRI''', ''International Relations Center'') is an educational and [[research institute]] belonging to [[Mexico]]'s [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM). Founded in 1970, the CRI is attached to UNAM's [[Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales]] (FCPyS, ''Faculty of Political and Social Sciences'') and offers academic degrees in [[international relations]] studies and theory.

==History==
UNAM was the first academic institution in [[Mexico]] to implement study and research programs in the field of international relations studies. Its first university program in the area was created in 1952, called "Diplomatic Sciences Degree". This degree was created to offer  [[multidisciplinary]] studies combining elements from [[History]], [[Law]] and [[Politics]].

In 1968, a reform transformed the degree program to a dedicated "International Relations Degree". In 1970, the CRI was formed as a distinct research and teaching center under the auspices and administration of the political and social sciences faculty (FCPyS) to coordinate UNAM's programs and research in international relations topics.

==Programs==
Currently the CRI divides its teaching and research programs into six areas:

*[[International relations theory|Theory and Methodology of International relations]]
*[[International politics]]
*[[International law]]
*[[International political economy|International economy]]
*[[Foreign relations of Mexico|Mexican Foreign Policy]]

'''Christopher Wolfgang Alexander''' (born 4 October 1936 in [[Vienna]], Austria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/ca/ca.html|title=PatternLanguage.com|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/caframe.htm?/../ca/whoswho.htm|title=CA FRAME|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a widely influential [[architect]] and design theorist, and currently [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|emeritus professor]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His theories about the nature of human-centered [[design]] have affected fields beyond architecture, including [[urban design]], [[software]], [[sociology]] and others.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander has designed and personally built over 100 buildings, both as an architect and a general contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/calexander/|title=Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=www.pps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html|title=2009 Scully Prize|author=|date=|website=nbm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the [[pattern language]] movement. The first [[wiki]]—the technology behind [[Wikipedia]]—led directly from Alexander's work, according to its creator, [[Ward Cunningham]].&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki C2 Wiki Front Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns C2 Wiki: People, Projects and Patterns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's work has also influenced the development of [[agile software development]].&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt;

In architecture, Alexander's work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the [[New Urbanist]] movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2009/12/do_you_see_a_pattern.html|title=Do You See a Pattern?|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski|date=2 December 2009|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.&lt;ref name="nikos"&gt;Nikos Salingaros, "[[A Theory of Architecture]]", Umbau-Verlag, Solingen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is known for many books on the design and building process, including ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]], [[A City is Not a Tree]]'' (first published as a paper and recently re-published in book form), ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]], A New Theory of Urban Design,'' and ''[[The Oregon Experiment]].'' More recently he published the four-volume ''[[The Nature of Order]]: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe,'' about his newer theories of "morphogenetic" processes, and ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth'', about the implementation of his theories in a large building project in Japan. All his works are developed or accumulated from his previous works, so his works should be read as a whole rather than fragmented pieces. His life's work or the best of his works is The Nature of Order on which he spent about 30 years, and the very first version of The Nature of Order was done in 1981, one year before this famous debate with Peter Eisenman in Harvard.

Alexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]],'' a perennial seller some four decades after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459281087&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+pattern+language|title=A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|first3=search|last3=results|first4=search|last4=results|first5=Ingrid|last5=Fiksdahl-King|first6=Shlomo|last6=Angel|date=7 June 1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2NSI4vSu_IC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0htfQ-O3KAhVE32MKHYy5BfkQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&amp;f=false|title=The Oregon Experiment|first1=Christopher|last1=Alexander|first2=Professor in the Department of Architecture Christopher|last2=Alexander|first3=Murray|last3=Silverstein|first4=Shlomo|last4=Angel|first5=Sara|last5=Ishikawa|first6=Danny|last6=Abrams|date=7 June 1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUGiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj97JbG9-3KAhUS5GMKHWBkDIUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&amp;f=false|title=How to Study Public Life|first1=Jan|last1=Gehl|first2=Birgitte|last2=Svarre|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Island Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1991-1/the-oregon-experiment-revisited|title=The Oregon Experiment after Twenty Years - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa, [[Murray Silverstein]], Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a "[[pattern language]]" to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.

==Personal life==
As a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2008|title=ARCH+ Zeitschrift für Architektur und Städtebau|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in [[Chichester]] and [[Oxford]], England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He moved to [[Berkeley, California]] in 1963 to accept an appointment as Professor of Architecture, a position he would hold for almost 40 years. In 2002, after his retirement, Alexander moved to [[Arundel]], England, where he continues to write, teach and build. Alexander is married to Margaret Moore Alexander, and he has two daughters, Sophie and Lily, by his former wife Pamela.

==Education==
Alexander attended [[Oundle School]], England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies.

==Honors==
Alexander was elected to the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]], Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/reflections-on-puarl-01062014/christopher-alexander-aia-medal|title=AIA First Medal for Research|author=AIA Journal|date=August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;; elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://acsa-arch.org/programs-events/awards/archives/DP ACSA Archives, Distinguished Professor Award winners.]&lt;/ref&gt; invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded the Seaside Prize, 1994; elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1996;&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt; one of the two inaugural recipients of the Athena Award, given by the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU), 2006;. awarded (''in absentia'') the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]], 2009; awarded the lifetime achievement award by the [[Urban Design Group]], 2011; winner of the [[Global Award for Sustainable Architecture]], 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patternlanguage.com/bios/vitae.htm|title=Curriculum Vitae|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Author===

''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:

{{quote|There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.}}

''[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]'' (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].

The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.

The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.

The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete. It uses [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities.

This book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.

''A New Theory of Urban Design'' (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in [[urbanism]] among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in [[San Francisco]], it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only ''local'' rules, in relation to neighbours. A vastly undervalued part of the Alexander canon, ''A New Theory'' is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the [[shanty town]]s latterly championed by [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 2 of his ''Whole Earth Discipline'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Neuwirth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow Cities: a billion squatters, a new urban world'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="Hanson-Younés"&gt;See Brian Hanson &amp; Samir Younés, "Reuniting Urban Form and Urban Process: The Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force", ''Journal of Urban Design'', v.6, no.2 (June 2001), pp.185-209; Charles, Prince of Wales, speech at the "Traditional Urbanism in Contemporary Practice" conference at The Prince's Foundation, London, 20 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been critical reconstructions of Alexander's design studio based on the theories put forward in ''A New Theory of Urban Design''.&lt;ref name="Warped"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7550339/Warped_educational_strategies_in_simulation_of_practice|title=Gareth Griffiths, "Warped educational strategies in simulation of practice", in ''Nordic Journal of Architectural Research'', 1/2013.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]]'' (2003–04), which includes The ''Phenomenon of Life'', ''The Process of Creating Life'', ''A Vision of a Living World'' and ''The Luminous Ground'', is Alexander's most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in which we view the world in general. The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by more dynamic sequences, which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). Sequences, like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).

The online publication ''Katarxis 3'' (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and [[Peter Eisenman]] from 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm |title=Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture: The 1982 Debate Between Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's latest book, ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems'' (2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies (System B). As Alexander describes it, System A is focused on enhancing the life/spirit of spaces within given constraints (land, budget, client needs, etc.) (drawings are sketches - decisions on placing buildings, materials used, finish and such are made in the field as construction proceeds, with adjustments as needed to meet overall budget); System B ignores, and tends to diminish or destroy that quality (architect responsible for drawings which the builder uses to build structures at the lowest possible cost). In the last few chapters he describes "centers" as a way of thinking about the connections among spaces, and about what brings more wholeness and life to a space.

===Works of architecture===
Among Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near [[Tokyo]] (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth''); the West Dean Visitors Centre &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/westdean.htm England, The West Dean Visitors Centre]'' - Project History&lt;/ref&gt; in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the [[Sala House]] and the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California made of lightweight concrete); the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses''); and several private houses (described and illustrated in ''The Nature of Order''). Alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality (which he used to call "the quality without a name", but named "wholeness" in ''Nature of Order'') that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure. This quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces, and is precisely what Alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories. Paradoxically, achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture, and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present.&lt;ref name="nikos" /&gt;

His former student and colleague [[Michael Mehaffy]] wrote an introductory essay on Alexander's built work in the online publication ''Katarxis 3'', which includes a gallery of Alexander's major built projects through September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery.htm |title=Gallery |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at [[UC Berkeley]] (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales's Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990–1994) and [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architectural-review.com/rethink/viewpoints/lessons-from-prince-charles/8636206.article Architectural Review, September 2012]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated the process which led to the international [[Building Beauty]] post-graduate school for architecture, which launched in Sorrento, Italy for the 2017-18 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buildingbeauty.org/|title=Building Beauty – First Level Master in Architecture|author=|date=|website=buildingbeauty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buildinggreen.com/newsbrief/architecture-hands-search-beauty|title=Architecture as a Hands-on Search for Beauty|author=|date=27 December 2017|website=buildinggreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Architecture===

Alexander's work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are [[Sarah Susanka]],&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Susanka: ''Not So Big House'', Taunton Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1561583766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andres Duany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Duany.htm|title=Andres Duany, Architect and Urban Theorist|author=|date=|website=www.katarxis3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Witold Rybczynski]].&lt;ref name="nbm.org"&gt;http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Campbell (journalist)|Robert Campbell]], the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the ''Boston Globe'', stated that Alexander "has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that's true of a whole generation of people."&lt;ref name="nbm.org"/&gt;

Architecture critic [[Peter Buchanan (architect)|Peter Buchanan]], in an essay for ''[[The Architectural Review]]''{{'}}s 2012 campaign ''The Big Rethink'', argues that Alexander's work as reflected in ''A Pattern Language'' is "thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be." He continues:
{{quote|Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction—although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them. The daunting challenge for architects then, if such a thing is even possible to realise, would be to recreate in a more contemporary idiom both the richness and quality of experience suggested by the pattern language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectural-review.com/the-big-rethink/the-big-rethink-transcend-and-include-the-past/8629373.article?blocktitle=Towards-a-Complete-Architecture&amp;contentID=4950 The Big Rethink: Transcend And include The Past], 24 April 2012 (accessed 5 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many urban development projects continue to incorporate Alexander's ideas. For example, in the UK the developers [[Living Villages]] have been highly influenced by Alexander's work and used ''A Pattern Language'' as the basis for the design of The Wintles in Bishops Castle, Shropshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/24/a-wander-round-the-wintles/|title=A Wander Round the Wintles » Transition Culture|first=Rob|last=Hopkins|date=|website=transitionculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Susanka]]'s "Not So Big House" movement adapts and popularizes Alexander's patterns and outlook.

===Computer science===

Alexander's ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'' was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence&lt;ref name="naur"&gt;{{cite conference | first = H. | last = Kilov | title = Using RM-ODP to bridge communication gaps between stakeholders | booktitle = Communications H Kilov | conference = Workshop on ODP for Enterprise Computing 2004 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.553 | quote = Peter Naur proposed in 1968 to use Christopher Alexander's work… }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and 1970s on [[programming language design]], modular programming, [[object-oriented programming]], [[software engineering]] and other design methodologies. Alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s influential ''A Discipline of Programming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Dijkstra

| title = A Discipline of Programming
| date = 1976-10-28

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest influence of ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' in computer science is the [[design patterns]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.text.html#COMPUTER |title= Christopher's Alexander's influence on Computer Science |author=Nikos A. Salingaros |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the [[extreme programming]] movement.&lt;ref name="accu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accu.org/index.php/journals/509|title=ACCU  :: eXtreme Programming An interview with Kent Beck|first=ACCU|last=Members|date=|website=accu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wiki]] was invented&lt;ref name="C2 Wiki Front Page"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c2.com"/&gt; to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming [[design patterns]]. More recently the "deep geometrical structures" as discussed in ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' have been cited as having importance for [[object-oriented programming]], particularly in C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/budha/coplien.htm|title=Space:  The Final Frontier|author=|date=|website=www.cs.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] wrote that Alexander's work was influential in the origin of the ''[[SimCity]]'' computer games, and in his later game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconeye.com/architecture/features/item/3261-will-wright-interview|title=Will Wright interview|author=|date=|website=iconeye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander has often led his own software research, such as the 1996 Gatemaker project with [[Greg Bryant (computer scientist)|Greg Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatemaker.org|title=Aspen -- early 1997|author=|date=|website=gatemaker.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/gatemaker|title=Gatemaker: Christopher Alexander's dialogue with the computer industry - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure, so called wholeness, which is defined mathematically, exists in space and matter physically, and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically. He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of ''The Nature of Order''. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in spirit to Google's PageRank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1502.03554 | title=Wholeness as a Hierarchical Graph to Capture the Nature of Space | journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science | volume=29 | issue=9 | pages=1632 | first=Bin | last=Jiang | date=27 March 2015| doi=10.1080/13658816.2015.1038542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The fourth volume of ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter, [[human perception]] of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and [[belief]]s, and recent scientific advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureoforder.com/summarybk4.htm|title=SUMMARY OF BOOK FOUR OF THE NATURE OF ORDER|author=|date=|website=www.natureoforder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his leanings toward [[Deism]], and his naturalistic and anthropological approach to religion, Alexander maintains that he is a practicing member of the [[Catholic Church]], believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals&lt;!-- There is no mention of 'accumulated human truth' or 'rituals' in the linked article. --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden|title=Making the Garden - Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=firstthings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design science===
The life's work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book ''Notes on the Synthesis of Forms'', he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure in ''[[The Nature of Order]]''. The design principles are differentiation and adaptation.

===Complex networks===
In his classic ‘A City is Not a Tree’, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book ‘Notes on the synthesis of forms’ on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004: [[Community structure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10543">'''Database design''' is the organisation of data according to a [[database model]]. The designer determines what data must be stored and how the data elements interrelate. With this information, they can begin to fit the data to the database model.&lt;ref name="Teorey, T.J. 2009"&gt;Teorey, T.J., Lightstone, S.S., et al., (2009). Database Design: Know it all.1st ed. Burlington, MA.: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

Database design involves classifying data and identifying interrelationships. This theoretical representation of the data is called an ''[[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]''. The ontology is the theory behind the database's design.

==Determining data to be stored==
In a majority of cases, a person who is doing the design of a database is a person with expertise in the area of database design, rather than expertise in the domain from which the data to be stored is drawn e.g. financial information, biological information etc. Therefore, the data to be stored in the database must be determined in cooperation with a person who does have expertise in that domain, and who is aware of what data must be stored within the system.

This process is one which is generally considered part of [[requirements analysis]], and requires skill on the part of the database designer to elicit the needed information from those with the [[domain knowledge]]. This is because those with the necessary domain knowledge frequently cannot express clearly what their system requirements for the database are as they are unaccustomed to thinking in terms of the discrete data elements which must be stored. Data to be stored can be determined by Requirement Specification.&lt;ref&gt;Teorey, T.; Lightstone, S. and Nadeau, T.(2005) ''Database Modeling &amp; Design: Logical Design'', 4th edition, Morgan Kaufmann Press. {{ISBN|0-12-685352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determining data relationships==
Once a database designer is aware of the data which is to be stored within the database, they must then determine where dependency is within the data. Sometimes when data is changed you can be changing other data that is not visible. For example, in a list of names and addresses, assuming a situation where multiple people can have the same address, but one person cannot have more than one address, the address is dependent upon the name. When provided a name and the list the address can be uniquely determined; however, the inverse does not hold - when given an address and the list, a name cannot be uniquely determined because multiple people can reside at an address.  Because an address is determined by a name, an address is considered dependent on a name.

(NOTE: A common misconception is that the [[relational model]] is so called because of the stating of relationships between data elements therein. This is not true. The relational model is so named because it is based upon the mathematical structures known as [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].)

==Logically structuring data==
{{Main|Logical schema}}
Once the relationships and dependencies amongst the various pieces of information have been determined, it is possible to arrange the data into a logical structure which can then be mapped into the storage objects supported by the [[database management system]]. In the case of [[relational databases]] the storage objects are [[database table|tables]] which store data in rows and columns. In an [[Object database]] the storage objects correspond directly to the objects used by the [[Object-oriented programming language]] used to write the applications that will manage and access the data. The relationships may be defined as attributes of the object classes involved or as methods that operate on the object classes.

The way this mapping is generally performed is such that each set of related data which depends upon a single object, whether real or abstract, is placed in a table. Relationships between these dependent objects is then stored as links between the various objects.

Each table may represent an implementation of either a logical object or a relationship joining one or more instances of one or more logical objects. Relationships between tables may then be stored as links connecting child tables with parents. Since complex logical relationships are themselves tables they will probably have links to more than one parent.

==ER diagram (entity-relationship model)==
[[Image:ER Diagram MMORPG.png|thumb|320px|A sample Entity-relationship diagram]]

Database designs also include ER ([[entity-relationship model]]) diagrams. An ER diagram is a diagram that helps to design databases in an efficient way.

Attributes in ER diagrams are usually modeled as an oval with the name of the attribute, linked to the entity or relationship that contains the attribute.

#'''Determine the purpose of the database''' - This helps prepare for the remaining steps.
#'''Find and organize the information required''' - Gather all of the types of information to record in the database, such as product name and order number.
#'''Divide the information into tables''' - Divide information items into major entities or subjects, such as Products or Orders. Each subject then becomes a table.
#'''Turn information items into columns''' - Decide what information needs to be stored in each table. Each item becomes a field, and is displayed as a column in the table. For example, an Employees table might include fields such as Last Name and Hire Date.
#'''Specify primary keys''' - Choose each table’s primary key. The primary key is a column, or a set of columns, that is used to uniquely identify each row. An example might be Product ID or Order ID.
#'''Set up the table relationships''' - Look at each table and decide how the data in one table is related to the data in other tables. Add fields to tables or create new tables to clarify the relationships, as necessary.
#'''Refine the design''' - Analyze the design for errors. Create tables and add a few records of sample data. Check if results come from the tables as expected. Make adjustments to the design, as needed.
#'''Apply the [[Database normalization|normalization rules]]''' - Apply the data normalization rules to see if tables are structured correctly. Make adjustments to the tables, as needed.

==Normalization==
{{main|Database normalization}}
In the field of [[relational database]] design, ''normalization'' is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general-purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics—insertion, update, and deletion anomalies that could lead to  loss of [[data integrity]].

A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective [[denormalization]] can subsequently be performed, but only for [[computer performance|performance]] reasons. However, some modeling disciplines, such as the [[dimensional modeling]] approach to [[data warehouse]] design, explicitly recommend non-normalized designs, i.e. designs that in large part do not adhere to 3NF.
Normalization consists of normal forms that are 1NF,2NF,3NF,BOYCE-CODD NF (3.5NF),4NF and 5NF

===Conceptual schema===
{{Main|Conceptual schema}}

===Schema refinement===
Schema refinement of the database specifies that the data is normalized to reduce data insufficiency and conflicts.

===Physical design===
{{Main|Physical schema}}
The physical design of the database specifies the physical configuration of the database on the storage media. This includes detailed specification of [[data element]]s, [[data type]]s, [[Index (database)|indexing]] options and other parameters residing in the DBMS [[data dictionary]]. It is the detailed design of a system that includes modules &amp; the database's hardware &amp; software specifications of the system.

{{distinguish|Devil's gardens}}

In [[myrmecology]] and [[forest]] [[ecology]], a '''devil's garden''' ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]: ''Supay chakra'',&lt;ref&gt;David P. Edwards, Megan E. Frederickson, Glenn H. Shepard, and Douglas W. Yu (2009): ''[http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/frederickson/ac-content/uploads/edwardsetal2009.pdf A Plant Needs Ants like a Dog Needs Fleas: Myrmelachista schumanni Ants Gall Many Tree Species to Create Housing.]'' The American Naturalist 174, no. 5: pp. 734-740.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Jardín del Curupira'') is a large [[stand level modelling|stand of tree]]s in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] consisting almost exclusively of a single species, ''[[Duroia hirsuta]]''. Devil's gardens are immediately recognizable because the dominance of a single tree species is dramatically different from the [[biodiversity]] of the forest as a whole.

Devil's gardens got their name because locals believed that an evil forest spirit ''[[Chullachaqui|Chullachaki]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://headoverheels.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ayahuasca_visions_-_pablo_amaringo.pdf Pablo Amaringo: Ayahuasca Visions] - "a vision of the Supay-chacra or garden of the Chullachaki."&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "uneven foot, single foot" in Kichwa) lived in them.

The [[ant]] ''[[Myrmelachista schumanni]]'' creates devil's gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except ''D. hirsuta'', the tree in which it nests. The ant poisons the plants by [[Injection (medicine)|injecting]] [[formic acid]] into the base of the [[leaf]]. By killing other plants, the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of ''D. hirsuta'', which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants; a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15,000 queens, and may persist for more than 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, M. E., Greene, M. J., &amp; [[Deborah Gordon|Gordon, D.]] (2005). Ecology: 'Devil's gardens' bedevilled by ants. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 437: 495-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ants fend off [[herbivore]]s, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, M. E., &amp; Gordon, D. (2007). The devil to pay: the cost of mutualism with ''[[Myrmelachista schumanni]]'' ants in 'devil's gardens' is increased herbivory on ''Duroia hirsuta'' trees. ''Proc. R. Soc.

==Social discrimination==

In the [[binary gender]] system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.&lt;ref name="ftmborderlands"&gt;Hale, J.C. (1998) "...[O]ur embodiments and our subjectivities are abjected from social ontology: we cannot fit ourselves into extant categories without denying, eliding, erasing, or otherwise abjecting personally significant aspects of ourselves ... When we choose to live with and in our dislocatedness, fractured from social ontology, we choose to forgo intelligibility: lost in language and in social life, we become virtually unintelligible, even to ourselves..." from ''Consuming the Living, Dis(Re)Membering the Dead in the Butch/FtM Borderlands'' in the ''Gay and Lesbian Quarterly'' 4:311, 336 (1998). Retrieved on 2007-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who identify as a gender that does not fit the traditional binary system tend to experience higher levels of social discrimination. A 2012 study from the [[National LGBTQ Task Force|''National LGBTQ Task Force'']] showed that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to suffer physical assaults (32% vs. 25%), experience police harassment (25% vs. 19%), and suffer sexual assaulted (15% vs. 19%) compared to transgender individuals who identified within the gender binary (i.e., [[Trans man|trans men]] and [[Trans woman|trans women]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e505652011-001|title=APA Policy Statement: Transgender, Gender Identity, &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination|date=2008|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer individuals also reported higher rates of harassment in K-12 school (83% vs. 77%), and sexual assault in K-12 schools (16% vs. 11%). This study reported that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to be [[people of color]] (30% vs. 23%) and younger (under 45) than binary transgender people (89% vs. 68%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Responders who identified as neither male nor female were less likely to be white and more likely to be multi racial, Black, or Asian, but less likely to be [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin-American/Spanish in origin]] compared to those who identified as male or female. The study showed that despite genderqueer and other non-nonbinary individuals having received significantly higher education than those who identified within the gender binary, they were more likely to be living in extreme poverty (under $10,000 yearly) than those who identified within the gender binary (21% vs. 14%). They were more likely to be involved in underground economies for income (20% vs. 15%) than those who identified within the gender binary. Respondents disclosed brutal effects of discrimination, which had grave impacts, as 43% of genderqueer participants reported attempting suicide compared to 40% of transgender individuals that identified within the gender binary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Discrimination|Social discrimination]] in the context of discrimination against non-binary and gender non-conforming people includes hate-motivated violence and excusing of such. According to a 2016 study from ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]],'' one of the most common themes of discrimination for genderqueer people is [[binarism]]. Also the incorrect use of preferred gender pronouns, which the study labeled ‘nonaffirmation’ occurs when others do not affirm one’s sense of gender identity. Participants within this study also reported experiencing [[gender policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadal|first=Kevin L.|last2=Whitman|first2=Chassitty N.|last3=Davis|first3=Lindsey S.|last4=Erazo|first4=Tanya|last5=Davidoff|first5=Kristin C.|date=2016-03-11|title=Microaggressions Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Genderqueer People: A Review of the Literature|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F00224499.2016.1142495|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=53|issue=4-5|pages=488–508|doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1142495|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from the book ''Violence and Gender'', states that this experienced violence and discrimination leads to high levels of stress.

In the United States of America, unemployment rates for transgender people are approximately twice as high as those for cisgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice At Every Turn: A Report Of The National Transgender Discrimination Survey|last=Grant, Jaime M., Mottet, Lisa A., &amp; Tanis, Justin|date=April 26, 2017|website=thetaskforce.org|archive-url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey&lt;ref name="ncte-ntds"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.transequality.org/issues/national-transgender-discrimination-survey|website=National Center for Transgender Equality|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the LGBTQ+ Task Force, it was found that almost all non-binary persons had experienced discrimination in the workplace. Their findings show that being out as a non-binary person negatively affects that person's employment outcomes. Though non-binary persons have higher unemployment rates than those who identify with a specified gender, masculine non-binary persons who still appear male, or are not "passing as female" generally have a harder time in the work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|title=Gender Inequality: Nonbinary Transgender People in the Workplace|last=Davidson|first=Skylar|date=April 26, 2017|website=umass.edu|archive-url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study by the Center for American Progress, 42% of gay employees said they have experienced discrimination of some form in the workplace; 50% of participants reported being harassed at work and 47% reported an adverse job outcome. That includes being fired or denied a promotion. In addition, 32% felt forced to act “traditionally gendered” to keep their jobs and 22% were denied access to bathrooms of choice based in gender identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electra.lmu.edu:2214/science/article/pii/S0001879117300684?#bb2015|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

19% of non-binary trans persons reported job loss due to anti-transgender bias, and 90% reported experiencing anti-transgender bias on the job. 78% of those who had transitioned during their time at the workplace were happy with their choice to do so, and reported feeling more comfortable at work, although they experienced more discrimination.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 

Not only does discrimination against transgender people in the workplace affect transgender employees, but it also affects the entire workplace team, distracting the victim and the perpetrator from the job itself. In 2001 study by the West Lothian Transgender Support Group, it was found that around 50 percent of transgender people do not survive beyond their thirtieth birthday, with most taking their own lives due to discrimination and others losing their lives from violence of cisgender individuals. The study’s statistic is also known as “the 50 percent rule” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00483480610670625#|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With that being said, transgender individuals in the U.S. often face workplace discrimination like conflicts related to their bathroom usage, backlash over transitioning genders and being “misgendered” by coworkers. The Center of American Progress in 2012 also found that there is also a substantial amount of public ignorance towards transgender communities, in comparison to LGB community peers. Because of that, negative psychological consequences occur as a result like mental health disparities, higher rates in attempted suicide, and paranoid thinking in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2011.534038|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Columbia University’s study in 2003 found that ideas of perceived discrimination are consistent with models of minority stress. It was also found that sexual minorities, such as the transgender community, are vulnerable to physical and mental health difficulties due to an exposure to chronic life stressors. The study finds that the transgender community in the U.S. possesses pre-conceived notions of rejection, hostility and discrimination from gender identities outside their groups &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141429999&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=47bc7b389eee5f9c9f03fbd56fad13c9|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Health discrimination==

===United States===
Transgender &amp; non-binary peoples generally seek greater care because of the stigma and the lack of knowledge about their experience on the behalf of rural physicians. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=J.|last2=Shaver|first2=John|last3=Stephenson|first3=Rob|date=2016-01-05|title=Outness, Stigma, and Primary Health Care Utilization among Rural LGBT Populations|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701471/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4701471|pmid=26731405}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that being said, non-binary individuals, and members of the LGBTQ community are very tentative when sharing their sexual identities to health care providers in fear of receiving inadequate/unfair treatment. In the 2001 Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, the study explores factors associated with disclosure. 88 individuals (76% non-binary) gave responses to a questionnaire asking about their most recent interaction with health care, and how their overall experience was. Of this group, more respondents answered that they avoided answering questions about their sexuality (38%) than honestly disclosing it to their health care provider (37%). The respondents who avoided the questions were in agreement that if they gave out their sexual identity, they would be treated differently or poorly. The overall rates of disclosure to health care providers are low because of the perception that health care settings/providers are threatening and unjust. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele J.|last2=Schope|first2=Robert|date=2001|title=&lt;Emphasis Type="Bold"&gt;Original Research:&lt;/Emphasis&gt; Does “Don't Ask Don't Tell” Apply to Health Care?

In the 2015 International Journal of Transgenderism, a big portion of non-binary individuals reported to have experienced discrimination from different types of medical services, including: doctors, emergency rooms, and ambulances. From the study, it was discovered that 20.4% of non-binary individuals experienced discrimination when trying to access doctors and hospitals, 11.9% faced discrimination when attempting to access emergency rooms, and 4.6% when attempting to access the service of an ambulance. Based on these statistics, there is a needed change in how health services treat non-binary patients to minimize the discrimination on these individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kattari|first=Shanna K.|last2=Walls|first2=N.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, non-binary individuals also experience health discrimination. Under the law of the United Kingdom, individuals are considered by the state to be either male or female, the gender that is stated on their birth certificate. This means that non-binary gender is not recognized in UK law. In a 2015 survey conducted by the Scottish Trans Alliance, three main areas were focused on including, non-binary individuals' experiences of medical services. When asked if they had ever experienced problems getting the help that was needed because of their non-binary identity, 56% said that they had. Some examples of this discrimination included refusal of surgery, withholding of treatment, discharging from clinics for being "untreatable," and no treatment due to not having protocol for non-binary individuals. In addition, more than half of the respondents answered that they experienced a delay in their treatment after being honest and open about their non-binary gender identities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Non-binary-GIC-mini-report.pdf|title=Non-binary people’s experiences

===Australia===
Similarly to the UK, a 2013 survey was designed to examine the healthcare experiences of non binary individuals, and all other members of the LGBTQ community. The survey asked participants to rate their mental and physical health, and how their experiences with psychiatrists, general practitioners, and surgeons were. They rated their experience in terms of comfort, discrimination, and information provided. 10 people given the gender male at birth and 78 given female at birth, yet all identifying as gender diverse or non-binary individuals, completed two separate surveys. 70% of the participants accessed a psychiatrist, and on average rated their experience as just below positive. The individuals assigned female at birth rated their experience worse than those assigned male at birth. After this data was recorded, an analysis of the responses suggested that the positive experiences were due to professional, helpful, knowledgeable, and caring practitioners. Negative experiences were due to the amount of ridiculous or offensive questions asked, and for little to no knowledge on their sexual identity. Overall, these findings indicated that medical professionals are falling short of adequately meeting the needs of non binary individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=Damien W|last2=Coleman|first2=Katrina|last3=Due|first3=Clemence|date=2014-03-06|title=Healthcare experiences of gender diverse Australians: a mixed-methods, self-report survey|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973980/|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=14|pages=230|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-230|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3973980|pmid=24597614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen percent of genderqueer individuals report job loss as a result of their identities.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter"/&gt; Anti-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination specifically against non-binary individuals do not exist.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, [[Title VII]] and the current proposed version of the federal [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] use such terms as "gender identity" and "gender expression", categories under which non-binary individuals fall due to the fact that their gender expression cannot be defined as male or female.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;

In 2004, Jimmie Smith was terminated from the fire department in Salem, Ohio after revealing their diagnosis with Gender Identity Disorder and intentions to undergo a male to female transition. The district court determined the reason for termination was because of their "transexuality" and not their gender non-conformity. The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which overturned that decision and clarified to courts that under Title VII, sex discrimination was to be considered broader than only the traditional assumptions of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reineck|first=Katie|date=2017|title=RUNNING FROM THE GENDER POLICE: RECONCEPTUALIZING GENDER TO ENSURE PROTECTION FOR NON-BINARY PEOPLE.|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law|volume=24|pages=265-322|via=OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W.

In 2016, the U.S. State Department was sued for denying a passport to [[Dana Zzyym]], who is a veteran and an intersex and non-binary person. Zzyym wrote "intersex" on their passport form instead of male or female, which were the only two available gender fields on the form. Zzyym was denied the passport, which led to LGBTQ advocacy organizations filing a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department on Zzyym's behalf. The advocacy group [[Lambda Legal]] argued for gender-neutral terms and a third option on U.S. passports, arguing that the existing passport fields violated the [[Due Process Clause]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. The State Department argued that adding additional gender fields to the passport form would prevent the agency's efforts to combat identity theft and passport fraud. The Tenth Circuit Court ruled in favor of Zzyym, the first time in U.S. history that the federal government recognized non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/intersex-dana-zzyym-passport-decision/|title=Judge rules in favor of intersex veteran who was denied passport|website=PBS NewsHour|date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, the District of Columbia, New York City, New York State, Iowa, Vermont, Oregon and Washington State have currently removed the surgical requirement to complete a change on a birth certificate. In these states, to change the gender on a birth certificate, one must fill out a standardized form but legal or medical approvals are not required. In Washington D.C., the applicant fills out the top half of the form and a health or social service professional must fill out the bottom half. A person may face obstacles obtaining a court order in order to make a change to documents in other states. Tennessee is the only state that has a specific statute that forbids altering the gender designation on a birth certificate due to gender surgery, while Idaho and Ohio have the same prohibition, but via court decision rather than by statute; and in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, a court ruled that gender markers could not be changed on identity documents under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-identity-document-faq|title=FAQ About Identity Documents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lambda-state&gt;{{cite web |title=Changing Birth Certificate Sex Designations: State-By-State Guidelines |author=&lt;!--staff writers, no byline--&gt; |url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-changing-birth-certificate-sex-designations |date=February 3, 2015 |website=Lambda Legal |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the Gender Recognition Act of 2017 was introduced in the State Senate in Sacramento in January 2017, and signed into law by governor [[Jerry Brown]] on October 19.  The law recognizes a third gender option known as "non-binary" which may be used on state-issued documents such as driver's licenses to more accurately reflect a person's gender. Senate bill SB179 was originally drafted by State Senators [[Toni Atkins]] and [[Scott Wiener]].  The law also makes it easier for existing documents to be changed, by removing requirements for sworn statements by physicians and replacing it with a sworn attestation by the person seeking to make the change to their documents.  The Executive Director of Equality California commented, "It is up to an individual—not a judge or even a doctor—to define a person's gender identity."&lt;ref name="Gutierrez-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill seeks 3rd gender option on licenses, birth certificates |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Melody |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Calif-lawmakers-seek-nonbinary-gender-10886782.php |date=January 26, 2017 |website=SFGate |publisher=[[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowerman-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Female, male or non-binary: California legally recognizes a third gender on identification documents |last1=Bowerman |first1=Mary |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/19/female-male-non-binary-california-legally-recognizes-third-gender-identification-documents/779188001/ |date=January 26, 2017 |website=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of organizations such as [https://www.intersexrecognition.org/ Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project] dozens of these petitions have been granted and additional states have changed regulations to provide a third gender option on state ID, birth certificates, and/or court orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intersexrecognition.org/resources|title=igrp {{!}} RESOURCES|website=igrp|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-binary is not recognized as a legal gender in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Legal_gender#UK|title=Legal gender - Nonbinary.org|website=nonbinary.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allowed people to apply to the [https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate Gender Recognition Panel] for a change of gender after living as the gender they wished to show on all their legal documents and being given a diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] by at least two health professionals. However, this change of gender only allowed for a change from male to female or vice versa.

In 2006 the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] was introduced, which issued documents to UK residents and linked them back to the National Identity Register database. When the issue of transgender people and their assigned vs. actual gender came up, it was said that transgender people would be issued two cards, each with a separate male and female gender marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmpublic/identity/100706/am/100706s01.htm|title=House of Commons Public Bill Committee : Identity Documents Bill|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that eventually the hope for some was that the identity cards would get rid of the gender markers altogether. The [[Identity Documents Act 2010]] made all these cards invalid and called for their immediate destruction.

In 2002, the [[Northwest Territories]] was the first of [[Canada]]’s provinces to explicitly include gender identity as a protected group from discrimination under the law, followed by [[Manitoba]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cossman|first=Brenda|date=January 2018|title=Gender identity, gender pronouns, and freedom of expression: Bill C-16 and the traction of specious legal claims|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|journal=University of Toronto Law Journal|volume=68|issue=1|pages=37–79|doi=10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|issn=0042-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, every Canadian province and territory had included similar changes to their discrimination laws.

In 2017, Canada passed [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]] which formally recognized non-binary gender people and granted them protection under the law towards discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “gender expression.”

===Australia===
The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 did not explicitly protect non-binary persons from discrimination until the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act of 2013, which prohibited any discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “intersex status.” This amendment also removed the use of “other” and “opposite sex” in exchange for broader terms like “different sex.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennet|first=Theodore|date=2014|title='NO MAN'S LAND': NON-BINARY SEX IDENTIFICATION IN AUSTRALIAN LAW AND POLICY.|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=37|pages=847-873|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Australian High Court]] legally recognized non-binary as a category for people to identify with on legal documents. After a citizen named Norrie made a request for a third gender identity on legal documents and was eventually denied, Norrie chose to take the matter up with Australia's [[Human Rights Commission]] and their [[Court of Appeal]]. After a four-year long legal battle beginning in 2010, Norrie finally won the case. From this and the legalizing of the matter in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]] made the decision to pass a law which recognized non-binary identities. Though this is a step in a positive direction for non-binary identifying Australians, the law currently lacks concise policies on marriage licenses and recognition of partnership for non-binary people. Because of this, Australians registered as non-binary may not be able to legally marry.

In addition to marriage issues, the non-binary marker for Australian citizens requires proof of [[gender confirmation surgery]]. Because non-binary people live outside of the [[gender binary]], they may not wish to obtain gender confirmation surgery. The people not wishing to do so ultimately will not be able to register as non-binary until this portion of the law is amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/recognition-of-nonbinary-gender-in-australian-high-court|title=Australian High Court Legally Recognizes Nonbinary Gender Identities -- But The News Isn't All Good|date=April 8, 2014|author= S.E. Smith|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With much of existing Australian legislature being crafted around a binary interpretation of sex, this “third-sex” approach has lead to complications with how laws interact with this new classification. In response, steps towards the de-emphasis of sex within legislation are being taken by removing sexual identification from legal areas that do not have a necessity for it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Drexler-Smalley cover.jpg|thumb|The debate between [[K. Eric Drexler]] and [[Richard Smalley]] on the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in 2003.]]

The '''Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology''' was a public dispute between [[K. Eric Drexler]], the originator of the conceptual basis of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[Richard Smalley]], a recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the [[nanomaterial]] [[buckminsterfullerene]]. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing [[molecular assembler]]s, which are [[molecular machine]]s which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.

The debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and [[open letter]]s. It began with a 2001 article by Smalley in ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was followed by a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] published by Drexler and coworkers later that year, and two open letters by Drexler in early 2003. The debate was concluded in late 2003 in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' in which both parties participated.

The debate has been often cited in the [[history of nanotechnology]] due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to go so far as to characterize the tone of the debate as similar to "a [[pissing contest|pissing match]]"&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "reminiscent of [a] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Yes, They Can!

==The participants==

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]

{{main|K. Eric Drexler}}

K. Eric Drexler is generally considered to have written the first scholarly paper on the topic of nanotechnology,&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58488-687-7 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work.&lt;ref name=edwardsdrexler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toumey|first=Christopher|title=Reading Feynman into nanotechnology: a text for a new science|journal=Techné|date=Fall 2008|volume=12|issue=3|page=133–168|doi=10.5840/techne20081231|url=http://litsciarts.org/slsa08/slsa08-650.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in [[molecular biology]] such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology. In a 1981 publication in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the [[ribosome]] were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work ''Nanosystems'' in 1992. He also co-founded the [[Foresight Institute]], a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"&gt;Edwards, pp. 15–21, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler's vision of nanotechnology, now called [[molecular nanotechnology]], is based on the concept of the [[molecular assembler]], a [[molecular machine]] which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between [[wet nanotechnology]] based on biological systems, and "second-generation" dry nanotechnology which would be based on [[mechanosynthesis]], positional control of molecules through principles more related to [[mechanical engineering]]. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.&lt;ref name="edwardsdrexler"/&gt;

===Richard Smalley===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|250px|Richard Smalley won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with [[Harry Kroto]] and [[Robert Curl]] for their 1985 discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]].]]

{{main|Richard Smalley}}

Richard E. Smalley, a chemist at [[Rice University]], was best known as a co-discoverer of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[Allotropes of carbon|form of carbon]] known as [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, along with [[Harry Kroto]], [[Robert Curl]], [[James R. Heath|James Heath]], and [[Sean O'Brien (scientist)|Sean O'Brien]]. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be discovered of the class of molecules known as [[fullerenes]], which also includes [[carbon nanotube]]s. The study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of the fields of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoelectronics]], and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 27, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley had also taken a prominent [[public policy]] role in relation to nanotechnology, and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising the possibility of [[Energy applications of nanotechnology|using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission]], and of developing [[Nanomedicine|nanomaterial-based drugs]] for [[targeted drug delivery]]. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology [[Startup company|startups]]. Smalley died of [[leukemia]] in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 132, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berube"/&gt;

==The debate==

===Smalley's ''Scientific American'' article===
[[File:Drexler-Smalley SciAm cover.png|thumb|Smalley's 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article doubting the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s led to a rebuttal by Drexler and his colleagues.]]

Smalley wrote an article, "Of Chemistry, Love, and Nanobots", for the September 2001 issue of the [[popular science]] magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'', which was a special issue on the topic of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms:

{{Quote|When a boy and a girl fall in love, it is often said that the chemistry between them is good. This common use of the word "chemistry" in human relations comes close to the subtlety of what actually happens in the more mundane coupling of molecules. In a chemical reaction between two 'consenting' molecules, bonds form between some of the atoms in what is usually a complex dance involving motion in multiple dimensions.... And if the chemistry is really, really good, the molecules that do react will all produce the exact product required.}}

He referenced the idea of a [[molecular assembler]], a [[nanorobot]] capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one [[Mole (chemistry)|mole]] of material, but [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a [[grey goo]] scenario, or, referring to [[Bill Joy]]'s previous article "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", that the nanorobots could develop [[swarm intelligence]] and become alive in some sense.

Smalley then considered how realistic the concept of a self-replicating nanorobot was. He noted that in a chemical reaction, the [[chemical bond]]s are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to the concept of molecular assembler, which he called the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem":

{{Quote|Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size. There just isn't enough room in the nanometer-size reaction region to accommodate all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete control of the chemistry.... [Also,] the atoms of the manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved. So it will often be impossible to release this minuscule building block in precisely the right spot. Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided. Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in our world.}}

Smalley closed the article by returning to the analogy of chemistry as a dance of love, remarking that "you don't make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together."

===Drexler's response===

Bottom, a schematic of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], which Drexler cited as being able to manipulate individual molecules via [[Mechanosynthesis|positional control]].|alt1=Ribosome schematic|alt2=Scanning tunneling microscope schematic}}

Drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through the [[Institute for Molecular Manufacturing]], which was co-authored with others including [[Robert Freitas]], [[J. Storrs Hall]], and [[Ralph Merkle]].&lt;ref name="drexlerresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=On Physics, Fundamentals, and Nanorobots: A Rebuttal to Smalley’s Assertion that Self-Replicating Mechanical Nanorobots Are Simply Not Possible |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K. Eric |last1=Drexler |first2=David |last2=Forrest |first3=Robert A. |last3=Freitas |first4=J. Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors first discussed the "fat fingers" argument by attacking Smalley's notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one of which can be immobilized and the other attached to a single "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the "sticky fingers" problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.

The authors put forth the [[ribosome]] as an example of a natural molecular machine; because the ribosome suffers from neither problem, they must not be fundamental, saying:

{{Quote|This ubiquitous biological molecular assembler suffers from neither the “fat finger” nor the “sticky finger” problem. If, as Smalley argues, both problems are “fundamental,” then why would they prevent the development of mechanical assemblers and not biological assemblers? If the class of molecular structures known as proteins can be synthesized using positional techniques, then why would we expect there to be no other classes of molecular structures that can be synthesized using positional techniques?}}

The authors also questioned Smalley's figures for the replication time of nanomachines. Instead of Smalley's figure of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz for the atomic placement frequency, they point out that ''Nanosystems'' suggested a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, a thousand times slower, and that at Smalley's higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds. The authors called this a [[straw man]] argument, writing that "in a serious scientific discussion, a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in the literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of the proposal."  The authors closed by stating that the best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work, and that "there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome, but thus far, there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible."

Drexler followed up with two open letters to Smalley in April and July 2003. The April letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=An Open Letter on Assemblers|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; began, "I have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work."  Drexler accused Smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what Drexler now calls "Smalley fingers", which he stated to be unlike the enzyme-like systems he had actually proposed. He asserted:

{{Quote|The impossibility of "Smalley fingers" has raised no concern in the research community because these fingers solve no problems and thus appear in no proposals. Your reliance on this straw-man attack might lead a thoughtful observer to suspect that no one has identified a valid criticism of my work. For this I should, perhaps, thank you.}}

Drexler compared the nanotechnology debate's importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before [[Sputnik]] or to theoretical work on [[nuclear chemistry]] before the [[Manhattan Project]]. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns."

The July 2003 letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=Toward closure|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/Letter2.html|publisher=Foresight Institute|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=2 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced a note from Smalley promising to respond, which had yet gone unfulfilled. Drexler mentions inconsistencies in Smalley's previous public statements on atom-by-atom construction, and ended by stating "I would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently, but the question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps the most fundamental issue in the field today—it shapes basic objectives and expectations—and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived."

===Exchange of letters in ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''===
[[File:Nanob.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a putative [[technomimetic]] molecular [[planetary gear]] set. Smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an [[enzyme]]-like mechanical process, either in an [[aqueous solution]] or with some other chemistry, and whether such devices would be operational at all.]]

The debate was concluded in a "Point–Counterpoint" feature that was the 1 December 2003 cover story of ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', the newsmagazine of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature first reproduced Drexler's April 2003 open letter to Smalley. Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book ''Engines of Creation'' had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that "Smalley fingers" could not work, and then asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled

He then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry, but asked how the nanorobot would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." Smalley asked what kind of "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries."

Drexler's counterresponse began by returning to Feynman's 1959 talk, stating that "although inspired by biology... Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, not biological." He characterized the challenges as being that of [[systems engineering]] rather than solely chemistry, and referred Smalley to ''Nanosystems'', with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion. He stated:

{{Quote|Positional control naturally avoids most side reactions by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with the reliability of digital switching operations in a computer. The supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "Nanosystems" and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.}}

Drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers, and would augment solution-phase chemistry to produce [[macroscopic]] products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks, using solution-phase molecular assemblers to [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] the construction of more sophisticated assemblers. He concluded by writing:

{{Quote|U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision articulated by Richard Feynman.}}

Smalley began his concluding letter:

{{Quote|I see you have now walked out of the room where I had led you to talk about real chemistry, and you are now back in your mechanical world. I am sorry we have ended up like this. For a moment I thought we were making progress. You still do not appear to understand the impact of my short piece in Scientific American. Much like you can't make a boy and a girl fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion along a few degrees of freedom in the assembler-fixed frame of reference. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that.}}

Smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must be limited to the "meat and bone of biology."  He accused Drexler of creating "a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there."

Lastly, Smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit, saying that nearly half of them thought that self-replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about the results of them spreading across the world. Smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay. Smalley concluded his letter:

{{Quote|You and people around you have scared our children. I don't expect you to stop, but I hope others in the chemical community will join with me in turning on the light, and showing our children that, while our future in the real world will be challenging and there are real risks, there will be no such monster as the self-replicating mechanical nanobot of your dreams.}}

==Critical response==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|image1=Raymond Kurzweil Fantastic Voyage.jpg|width1=160|image2=Lessig portrait.jpg|width2=150|footer=The Drexler–Smalley debate attracted commentary from figures such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] (left) and [[Lawrence Lessig]] (right).|alt1=Ray Kurzweil in 2005|alt2=Lawrence Lessig in 2009}}

===Tone===
The debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone. David Berube in ''Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz'' characterized it as "two people talking over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and a place in the pantheon."&lt;ref name="berube"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ |pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zyvex]] founder James von Ehr remarked that "Eric [Drexler] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a [[Pissing contest|pissing match]] with a Nobel-prize winner."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;  An article in ''The New York Times'' called the debate "reminiscent of that old ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch... [with] Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," referring to a version of the long-running [[Weekend Update#Jane Curtin (1976–1980)|Weekend Update]] segment.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Technical commentary===
The debate has received technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in ''The Nanotech Pioneers'' noted that the ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of the argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that "nowhere in it does ''Nanosystems'' contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together."  He concludes that "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists."&lt;ref name="edwardsresponse"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' declared Drexler as the winner of the debate,&lt;ref name="kurzweil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-303788-9|pages=236&amp;ndash;241}}&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the view that Smalley distorted Drexler's ideas and calling Smalley's responses "short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors" and asserting that "Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions... [which have] been extensively studied."  He quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions, and pointed out that modern non-biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded the capabilities of natural biological systems. He also noted that "earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible... [but today] we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-drexler-smalley-debate-on-molecular-assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on public perception of nanotechnology===
The debate's focus on the public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger [[Glenn Reynolds]] stated that "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"&gt;Berube, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Lessig]] criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research."&lt;ref name="berubesocial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Stamping Out Good Science|date=July 2004|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=5|accessdate=12 July 2011|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="kurzweil"/&gt;

The '''environmental effect of pharmaceuticals and personal care products''' ('''PPCPs''') is currently being widely investigated. PPCPs include substances used by individuals for personal health or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. More than twenty million tons of PPCPs are produced every year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jianlong|last2=Wang|first2=Shizong|title=Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater: A review|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=182|pages=620–640|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.049|pmid=27552641|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Further research is needed to evaluate the risks of [[toxicity]], persistence, and [[bioaccumulation]]. PPCPs encompass [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPPs) and are one type of [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic pollutants]]. They are not removed from wastewater by conventional methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[European Union]] has declared [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil to be "priority substances".[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-WFD2013-2|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Overview==
Since the 1990s, [[water contamination]] by pharmaceuticals has been an [[list of environmental issues|environmental issue]] of concern.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doerr-MacEwen NA, Haight ME |title=Expert stakeholders' views on the management of human pharmaceuticals in the environment |journal=Environ Manage |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=853–66 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16955232 |doi=10.1007/s00267-005-0306-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to note that many public health professionals in the United States began writing reports of pharmaceutical contamination in waterways in the 1970s.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pharmaceuticals in drinking-water |date=2012 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=9789241502085 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |oclc=806494582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pharmaceuticals are deposited in the environment through human consumption and excretion, and are often filtered ineffectively by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants which are not designed to manage them. Once in the water, they can have diverse, subtle effects on organisms, although research is still limited. Pharmaceuticals may also be deposited in the environment through improper disposal, runoff from [[sludge]] fertilizer and reclaimed wastewater irrigation, and leaky sewer pipes.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen/&gt; In 2009, an investigative report by [[Associated Press]] concluded that U.S. manufacturers had legally released 271 million pounds of compounds used as drugs into the environment, 92% of which was the industrial chemicals [[phenol]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which are also used as antiseptics. It could not distinguish between drugs released by manufacturers as opposed to the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. It also found that an estimated 250 million pounds of pharmaceuticals and contaminated packaging were discarded by hospitals and long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Donn J. (2009). [https://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2009/04/19/tons-of-released-drugs-taint-us-water.html?PageNr=1 Tons of Released Drugs Taint U.S. Water]. AP.&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles led to a hearing{{when|date=November 2018}} conducted by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality. This hearing was designed to address the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in U.S. drinking water. This was the first time that pharmaceutical companies were questioned about their waste disposal methods. "No federal regulations or laws were created as a result of the hearing."{{cn|date=November 2018}} "Between the years of 1970-2018 more than 3000 pharmaceutical chemicals were manufactured, but only 17 are screened or tested for in waterways."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alternately, "There are no studies designed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical contaminated drinking water on human health.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In parallel, the [[European Union]] is the second biggest consumer in the world (24% of the world total) after the USA and in the majority of EU Member States, around 50% of unused human medicinal products is not collected to be disposed of properly. In the EU, between 30 and 90% of the orally administered doses are estimated to be excreted as the active substances in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/environment/study_environment.pdf  BIO Intelligence Service (2013), Study on the environmental risks of medicinal products, Final Report prepared for Executive Agency for Health and Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPP) was suggested in the 2010 nomination of pharmaceuticals and environment as an emerging issue to [[Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management]] ([[SAICM]]) by the [[International Society of Doctors for the Environment]] (ISDE).

=== Safe disposal ===
Depending on the sources and ingredients, there are various ways in which the public can dispose of pharmaceutical and personal care products in acceptable ways. The most environmentally safe disposal method is to take advantage of a community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.  Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated these programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs, as well as the [[National Take Back Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Prescription Drug Take Back Day |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html |website=Office of Diversion Control |publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration |location=Springfield, Virginia |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, take-back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction.  This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long Battle for State Drug Take-Back Program Must Continue|url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/03/13/1577405/long-battle-for-state-drug-take.html|accessdate=04/05/2011|newspaper=The Olympian|date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take-back programs should exist in every community, and, if further information is required on this, city officials should be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/pdf/prescrip_disposal.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331051508/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/pdf/prescrip_disposal.pdf |title=Proper Disposal of Prescription Drugs |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 2009 |archive-date=2010-03-31 |website= |publisher=U.S. Office of National Drug Policy |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no such program exists locally, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] suggest that consumers do the following:
# take the prescription drugs out of their original containers
# mix drugs with [[Litter box|cat litter]] or [[used coffee grounds]]
# place the mixture into a disposable container with a lid, such as a sealable bag
# cover up any personal identification with a black marker that is on the original pill containers
# place these containers in the bag with the mixture, seal them, and place them in the trash.

This will hopefully keep these chemicals separated from the open environment and especially water bodies long enough for them to naturally break down.

When these substances find their way into water, it is much more difficult to deal with them. Water treatment facilities use different processes in order to minimize or fully eliminate these pollutants. This is done by using [[sorption]] where suspended solids are removed by [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, H., Ternes, T.A., Joss, A., (2004) Scrutinizing Pharmaceuticals and Personal 	Care 	Products in Wastewater Treatment Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology,38 392A-399A&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method used is [[biodegradation]], and through this method microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], feed on or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.

==Types==
[[File:Ecstasy Pills.jpg|thumb|
Illicit drugs such as ecstasy (above) can be found in waterways. 
]]
[[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceuticals]], or prescription and over-the-counter medications made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common PPCPs found in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are nine classes of pharmaceuticals included in PPCPs: [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotics]], [[Clofibrate|lipid regulators]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[antineoplastics]], and diagnostic contrast media.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Personal care|Personal care products]] have four classes: [[fragrances]], [[preservative]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, and [[Octocrylene|sunscreen agents]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These products may be found in cosmetics, perfumes, menstrual care products, lotions, shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, and sunscreen. These products typically enter the environment when passed through or washed off the body and into the ground or sewer lines, or when disposed of in the trash, septic tank, or sewage system.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Traces of illicit drugs can be found in waterways and may even be carried by money.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Routes into the environment ==

More attention has been devoted of late to PPCPs in the environment. Two causes may contribute to this: PPCPs are actually increasing in the environment due to widespread use and/or analytical technology is better able to detect PPCPs in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These substances enter the environment directly or indirectly. Direct methods include contamination of surface water by hospitals, households, industries, or wastewater treatment plants. Direct contamination can also affect the sediment and soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu" /&gt;

Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (&gt;1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfill the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.

Pharmaceuticals used in veterinary medicine, or as additives to animal food, pose a different problem, since they are excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. It is well known that such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.

{{details|topic=how pollutants enter the environment through the manufacturing of PPCPs|Industrial ecology}}
The use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is on the rise with an estimated increase from 2&amp;nbsp;billion to 3.9&amp;nbsp;billion annual prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tong|first=A.Y.|author2=Peake, B. |author3=Braund, R. |title=Disposal practices for unused medications around the world|journal=Environment International|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=292–298|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.002|pmid=20970194}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs enter into the environment through individual human activity and as residues from manufacturing, agribusiness, [[veterinary]] use, and [[hospital]] and community use. In Europe, the input of pharmaceutical residues via domestic waste water is estimated to be around 80% whereas 20% is coming from hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf EU project report summary "Pharmaceutical Input and Elimination from Local Sources", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may add PPCPs to the environment through waste excretion and bathing as well as by directly disposing of unused medications to [[septic tanks]], [[Sewerage|sewers]], or trash.  Because PPCPs tend to dissolve relatively easily and do not evaporate at normal temperatures, they often end up in soil and water bodies.

Some PPCPs are broken down or processed easily by a human or animal body and/or degrade quickly in the environment . However, others do not break down or degrade easily. The likelihood or ease with which an individual substance will break down depends on its chemical makeup and the metabolic pathway of the compound.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/ppcp |title=Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, D.C. |access-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] found detectable quantities of one or more chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-027-02/ |title=Pharmaceuticals, Hormones, and Other Organic Wastewater Contaminants in U.S. Streams |last1=Buxton |first1=H.T. |last2=Kolpin |first2=D.W. |date=June 2002 |website= |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |series=USGS Fact Sheet FS-027-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common pharmaceuticals detected were  nonprescription drugs; [[detergents]], [[fire retardant]]s, [[pesticides]], natural and synthetic [[hormones]], and an assortment of [[antibiotics]] and [[prescription medication]]s were also found.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/ppcp_about.html Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products in Drinking Water Supplies.]"  The Groundwater Foundation.  Accessed 19 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included [[antibiotics]], [[analgesics]] and anti-inflammatories, [[lipid]] regulators, [[beta-blockers]], [[anti-convulsant]], and [[steroid hormones]]. Although most chemical concentrations were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of [[bioaccumulation]] of these pharmaceutical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernando|first=M.D.|author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernandez-Alba, A.R. |author4=Barcelo, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments|journal=Talanta|year=2006|volume=69|issue=2|pages=334–342|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the identified input from human medicine there appears diffuse pollution for example from pharmaceuticals used in agriculture, too. Investigations in [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Scotland]] showed traces of PPCPs upstream of waste water treatment plant effluents to rivers, too.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no-pills.eu/conference/BS_NoPills_Final%20Report_long_EN.pdf|title= EU project noPILLS in waters, final report 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Human===
The scope of human exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the environment is a complex function of many factors. These factors include the concentrations, types, and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the environment; the pharmacokinetics of each drug; the structural transformation of the chemical compounds either through metabolism or natural degradation processes; and the potential bioaccumulation of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–122 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to determine the effects on humans of long-term exposure to low levels of PPCPs.  The full effects of mixtures of low concentrations of different PPCPs is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.drinktap.org/consumerdnn/Default.aspx?tabid=73 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water]."  American Water Works Association. Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The U.S. EPA risk assessment states that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pharmaceuticals is around 0.0027 mg/kg‐day."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Due to the lack of research of toxicity guidelines and their effects on human health it is difficult to determine a healthy dosage for water contaminated by pharmaceuticals. "The pharmaceutical sample size tested does not give a full representation of human exposure. Only 17 out of 3000 prescriptions are screened for in drinking water."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, “The EPA and FDA regulations state that a drug or chemical is not considered harmful until clear evidence shows that  a substance causes harm".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Shane |date=November 201 0|title=Pharmaceuticals in the Water Environment |url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/policy/acsonthehill/briefings/pharmaceuticalsinwater/nacwa-paper.pdf |journal=Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies |volume=|pages=38|via=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that we are not testing or screening for thousands of contaminants in our drinking water. Health risk assessments have not been conducted to provide concrete evidence to link pharmaceutical contamination and adverse human health effects.

"However adverse health outcomes are displayed in aquatic organisms. Fish living near water treatment plants have been reported to be feminized."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; "Some male fish started to develop ovaries and other feminized characteristic due to pharmaceutical pollution some species have decreased in population due to exposure of EE2 and other hormonal ECD substances."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although research has shown that PPCPs are present in water bodies throughout the world, no studies have shown a direct effect on human health. However, the absence of empirical data cannot rule out the possibility of adverse outcomes due to interactions or long-term exposures to these substances. Because the amounts of these chemicals in the water supply may be in the parts per trillion or parts per billion, it is difficult to chemically determine the exact amounts present. Many studies&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–102 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; have therefore been focused to determining if the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals exist at or above the accepted daily intake (ADI) at which the designed biological outcomes can occur.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"/&gt;

In addition to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated about the potential for inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hernando |first=M.D. |author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernández-Alba, AR. |author4=Barceló, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments |journal=Talanta |year=2006 |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=334–342 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus).&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segura |first=P.A. |author2=Francois, M. |author3=Gagnon, C. |author4=Sauve, S. |title=Review of the Occurrence of Anti-infectives in Contaminated Wastewaters and Natural and Drinking Waters |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2005 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=675–684 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11776 |pmid=19479007 |pmc=2685827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopes |first3=C.R. |title=Antimicrobial Susceptibility of 51 Campylobacter Strains Isolated From Diarrheic and Diarrhea-Free Dogs |journal=Arquivos do Instituto Biológic. |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=3|pages=283–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09&amp;nbsp;ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"/&gt; Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants.&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"/&gt; Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"/&gt;

The relationship between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted.  Risk management is most effective once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood.  There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste according to a study conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Bellis|title=Knowing the risk: relationships between behaviour and health knowledge.  Public Health 115, 54-61|publisher=Public Health|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"/&gt;

It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public in a way that does not impart guilt but rather public awareness.  For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlund|first=A.M.|title=Effects of values, problem awareness, and personal norm on willingness to reduce personal car use|publisher=J. Environment Psychol.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars.  Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation.  Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.

In order to conduct this study, the pharmaceuticals were grouped by their therapeutic action in order to help participants identify them.  The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: [[antibacterials]], [[antidepressants]], [[antihistamines]], [[antiepileptics]], [[hormone]] treatments, and [[lipid]] regulators.  Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment.  Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals.  Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants.  The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.  Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them.  Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.  Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.

Dr. Bound noted that participation in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members with the ability to better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment.  In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication.  There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat.  Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public.  In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.

=== Recommendations ===
Several recommendations and initiatives have been made to prevent pharmaceutical pollution in the environment.  Important practices include educating patients on the importance of proper unused drug disposal, educating physicians and patients of proper drug disposal, encouraging pharmaceutical industries to implement strategies for proper disposal of drugs or recycling strategies, and enforcing hospitals to implement better management practices for disposing pharmaceutical waste.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhati|first=Itishri|date=Dec 2013|title=Greener Route to Prevent Pharmaceutical Pollution|url=http://ijpcsonline.com/files/23-674.pdf|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences|volume= 2 |issue= 4|pages=7|via=IJPCS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, it is imperative that patients become educated on pharmaceutical pollution and its hazardous effects on humans, animals, and the overall environment.  By educating patients on proper disposal of unused drugs, steps are being taken to further prevent pharmaceutical waste in the environment.  Consumers should take precautions before tossing out drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Bhavana|date=2014-05-25|title=Drug disposal and environmental concern|url=http://jddt.in/index.php/jddt/article/view/192|journal=Journal of Drug Discovery and Therapeutics|language=en|volume=2|issue=17|issn=2320-4230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community take back programs have been set up for consumers to bring back unused drugs for proper disposal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Another initiative is for pharmacies to serve as a take back site for proper drug disposal such as implementing recycling bins for customers to bring back unused or expired medicines while they’re shopping.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, educating physicians and patients on the importance of proper drug disposal and the environmental concern will help further reduce pharmaceutical waste.

Also, implementing initiatives for hospitals to focus on better practices for hazardous waste disposal may prove to be beneficial.  The US EPA incentives hospitals to develop efficient pharmaceutical disposal practices by giving them grants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This incentive may be very beneficial to other hospitals worldwide.

Additionally, “It is critical for us to develop an analytical method of identifying, testing, and regulating the amount of pharmaceuticals in the water systems”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Data must be collected in order to accurately measure the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. “Multiple Health risk assessments should be conducted to understand the effects of prolonged exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Community based programs should be developed to monitor exposure and health outcomes.  We should encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop technology that extracts pharmaceutical contains form waterways. “Extensive research must be conducted to determine the amount of pharmaceutical contamination in the environment and its effects on  animals and marine life”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Environmental===
While the full effects of most PPCPs on the environment are not understood, there is concern about the potential they have for harm because they may act unpredictably when mixed with other chemicals from the environment or concentrate in the food chain. Additionally, some PPCPs are active at very low concentrations, and are often released continuously in large or widespread quantities.

Because of the high solubility of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects.  Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants may be found in frogs and can significantly slow their development.{{mcn|date=September 2015}}  The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campusecology.wsu.edu/page_055.htm Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment]."

In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain.{{mcn|date=September 2015}} Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, W., Yates, S.R., Bradford, S.A. ( 2007) Analysis of Steroid Hormones in a Typical 	Dairy Waste Disposal System Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 42, 530-535&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the pollution from PPCPs affect marine ecosystems, but also those habitats that depend on this polluted water.

There are various concerns about the effects of pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents.  Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water.  In a study by Dr. Jerker Fick from [[Umeå University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fick |first=Jerker |title=Therapeutic Levels of Levonorgestrel Detected in Blood Plasma of Fish: Results from Screening Rainbow Trout Exposed to Treated Sewagae Effluents |publisher=Evniron. Sci. Technol |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage water at three different sits in Sweden.  They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis.  The [[progestin]] Levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12&amp;nbsp;ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level.  Studies show that the measured effluent level of Levonorgestrel in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

The three sites chosen for field exposures were in located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Umeå.  They were chosen according to their varying degrees of treatment technologies, geographic locations, and size.  The effluent treatment includes active sludge treatment, nitrogen and phosphorus removal (except in Umeå), primary clarification, and secondary clarification.  Juvenile rainbow trout were procured from Antens fiskodling AB, Sweden and Umlax AB, Sweden.  The fish were exposed to aerated, undiluted, treated effluent.  Since all of the sites underwent sludge treatment, it can be inferred that they are not representative of the low end of treatment efficacy. Of the 21 pharmaceuticals that were detected in the water samples, 18 were identified in the effluent, 17 in the plasma portion, and 14 pharmaceuticals were found in both effluent and plasma.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

==Current research==
[[File:Waterways1.jpg|thumb|311x311px|
There are traces pharmaceuticals in waterways that have an adverse effect on the environment. 
]]
Starting in the mid-1960s, ecologists and toxicologists began to express concern about the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the water supply, but it wasn’t until a decade later that the presence of pharmaceuticals in water was well documented. Studies in 1975 and 1977 found [[clofibric]] acids and [[salicylic acid]]s at trace concentrations in treated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=S. |last2=Westerhoff |first2=P.|last3=Yoon|first3=Y.|last4=Sedlak|first4=D.|title=Pharmaceuticals, Personal Care Products, and Endocrine Disruptors in Water: Implications for the Water Industry |journal=Environmental Engineering Science |year=2003 |volume=20 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread concern about and research into the effect of [[PPCP]]s largely started in the early 1990s.  Until this time, PPCPs were largely ignored because of their relative solubility and containment in waterways compared to more familiar pollutants like [[agrochemicals]], industrial chemicals, and [[industrial waste]] and byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ce-Cr/Chemicals-from-Pharmaceuticals-and-Personal-Care-Products.html Chemicals from Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products]."  Water Encyclopedia.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a great deal of attention has been directed to the ecological and physiological risk associated with pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites in water and the environment. In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on [[steroid hormones]] and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Some research suggests that concentrations of [[ethinylestradiol]], an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102" /&gt;

===Pharmacoenvironmentology===
Pharmacoenvironmentology is an extension of pharmacovigilance as it deals specifically with the environmental and ecological effects of drugs given at therapeutic doses.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Syed Ziaur|last2=Khan|first2=Rahat Ali|last3=Gupta|first3=Varun|last4=Uddin|first4=Misbah|date=2007-07-24|title=Pharmacoenvironmentology – a component of pharmacovigilance|journal=Environmental Health|volume=6|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1476-069x-6-20|pmid=17650313|pmc=1947975|issn=1476-069X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacologists with this particular expertise (known as a pharmacoenvironmentologist) become a necessary component of any team assessing different aspects of drug safety in the environment.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt; We must look at the effects of drugs not only in medical practice, but also at its environmental effects. Any good clinical trial should look at the impact of particular drugs on the environment. Things we need to address in pharmacoenvironmentology are drugs and their exact concentration in different parts of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medhi|first=Bikash|last2=Sewal|first2=RakeshK|date=2012-09-01|title=Ecopharmacovigilance: An issue urgently to be addressed|url=http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2012/44/5/547/100363|journal=Indian Journal of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=547–9|doi=10.4103/0253-7613.100363|pmid=23112410|pmc=3480781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacoenvironmentology is a specific domain of pharmacology and not of environmental studies.This is because it deals with drugs entering through living organisms through elimination.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacovigilance===
Pharmacovigilance is a new branch of science, which was born in 1960 after the incidence of the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a teratogen and caused horrific birth abnormalities. The thalidomide disaster lead to the present day approach to drug safety and adverse event reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ann|title=Thalidomide: was the tragedy preventable?|journal=The Lancet|volume=351|issue=9110|pages=1197–1199|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09038-7|pmid=9643709|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA, pharamacovigilance is science aiming to capture any adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in humans after use. However, ecopharmacovigilance is  the science, and activities concerning detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment which affect humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There has been a growing focus among scientists about the impact of drugs on the environment.  In recent years, we have been able to see human pharmaceuticals that are being detected in the environment which most are typically found on surface water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The importance of ecopharmacovigilance is to monitor adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on humans through environmental exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this relatively new field of science, researchers are continuously developing and understanding the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment and its risk on human and animal exposure. Environmental risk assessment is a regulatory requirement in the launch of any new drug.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This precaution has become a necessary step towards the understanding and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceutical residue in the environment.  It is important to note that pharmaceuticals enter the environment from the excretion of drugs after human use, hospitals, and improper disposal of unused drugs from patients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacology===
Ecopharmacology concerns the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. Ecopharmacology is a broad term that includes studies of “PPCPs” irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.&lt;ref name="Ilene Sue Ruhoy 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue Ruhoy|first1=Ilene|last2=Daughton|first2=Christian G.|year=2008|title=Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate|url=|journal=Environment International|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1157–1169|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002|pmid=18571238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Hashemi| first= Zahra | authorlink = | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to Environmental Pharmacology | chapter = Addendum: Terminologies related to Drug Safety | editor = Rahman SZ, Shahid M &amp; Gupta A | others = | edition = 1st | pages = 257–259| publisher = [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]]| location = Aligarh | isbn = 978-81-906070-4-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20| doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology–A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health |date=July 2007| volume= 6 | issue=20| page= 20| pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geology of a karst aquifer area assists with the movement of PPCPs from the surface to the ground water. Relatively soluble bedrock creates sinkholes, caves and sinking streams into which surface water easily flows, with minimal filtering.  Since 25% of the population get their drinking water from karst aquifers, this affects a large number of people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodgen|first=L.K.|last2=Kelly|first2=W.R.|last3=Panno|first3=S.V.|last4=Taylor|first4=S.J.|last5=Armstrong|first5=D.L.|last6=Wiles|first6=K.N.|last7=Zhang|first7=Y.|last8=Zheng|first8=W.|title=Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=578|pages=281–289|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.103|pmid=27836351|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 study of karst aquifers in southwest Illinois found that 89% of water samples had one or more PPCP measured. Triclocarban (an antimicrobial) was the most frequently detected PPCP, with gemfibrozil (a cardiovascular drug) the second most frequently detected.  Other PPCPs detected were trimethoprim, naproxen, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine. The data suggests that septic tank effluent is a probable source of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Fate of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants ===

[[File:Pipes of the Minsk sewage treatment plant - 3.jpg|thumb|316x316px|
[[Sewage treatment plants]] use physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water.]]
[[Sewage treatment plants]] (STP) work with physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water. Usually the STP is equipped with an initial mechanical separation of solid particles (cotton buds, cloth, hygiene articles etc.) appearing in the incoming water. Following this there may be filters separating finer particles either occurring in the incoming water or developing as a consequence of chemical treatment of the water with flocculating agents.

Many STPs also include one or several steps of biological treatment. By stimulating the activity of various strains of microorganisms physically their activity may be promoted to degrade the organic content of the sewage by up to 90% or more. In certain cases more advanced techniques are used as well. The today most commonly used advanced treatment steps especially in terms of micropollutants are

*[[Membrane technology|membrane]]s (which may be used instead of the biological treatment),
*[[ozone|ozonation]],
*[[activated carbon]] (powdered or granulated),
*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV treatment]],
* treatment with [[Ferrate(VI)|ferrate]] and
*[[Slow sand filter|sand filtration]] (which is sometimes added as a last step after the aforementioned).

PPCPs are difficult to remove from wastewater with conventional methods. Some research shows the concentration of such substances is even higher in water leaving the plant than water entering the plant. Many factors including environmental pH, seasonal variation, and biological properties affect the ability of a STP to remove PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2013 study of a drinking water treatment plant, found that of 30 PPCPs measured at both the source water and the drinking water locations, 76% of PPCPs were removed, on average, in the water treatment plant. Ozonation was found to be an efficient treatment process for the removal of many PPCPs.  However, there are some PPCPs that were not removed, such as DEET used as mosquito spray, nonylphenol which is a surfactant used in detergents, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the herbicide atrazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhye|first=Lokesh P.|last2=Yao|first2=Hong|last3=Kung'u|first3=Francis T.|last4=Huang|first4=Ching-Hua|title=Year-long evaluation on the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting chemicals in an urban drinking water treatment plant|journal=Water Research|volume=51|pages=266–276|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.070|pmid=24262763|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several research projects are running to optimize the use of advanced sewage treatment techniques under different conditions. The advanced techniques will increase the costs for the sewage treatment substantially.
In a European cooperation project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital waste water treatment facilities were developed in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/ |title=The PILLS Project |website=www.pills-project.eu |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the German STP at Marienhospital [[Gelsenkirchen]] showed the effects of a combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GeQyqO9KEI |title=noPILLS Emschergenossenschaft Gelsenkirchen (Marienhospital)|last=EGLV Emschergenossenschaft/ Lippeverband|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially [[radiocontrast agent]]s are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf|title=EU project PILLS summary |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/organische_mikroverunreinigungen_in_gewassern_vierte_reinigungsstufe.pdf |title=Report of the German Federal Environment Agency |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to define best available technique before extensive infrastructure investments are introduced on a wide basis.

The fate of incoming pharmaceutical residues in the STP is unpredictable. Some substances seem to be more or less completely eliminated, while others pass the different steps in the STP unaffected. There is no systematic knowledge at hand to predict how and why this happens.

Pharmaceutical residues that have been conjugated (bound to a bile acid) before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.

=== Regulation ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}
In the United States, “There are no federal regulations limiting the levels of pharmaceuticals in wastewater or drinking water”, according to EPA.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Three birth controls substances and one antibiotic were added to the pharmaceuticals contaminant candidate list (CCL 3). EPA states that they are 8 pharmaceuticals that are classified as hazardous waste.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Out of 3000 pharmaceuticals EPA has only evaluated 100 of them leaving numerous of unscreened compounds in the water.” In 2008, EPA proposed an amendment to the Universal Waste Rule to address pharmaceutical wastes.” However, no action on the Rule has occurred since the hearing in the U.S. senate in 2009”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA), and the Universal Waste Regulations under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) do little to protect the American population from pharmaceutical contamination in waterways.{{POV check inline|date=November 2018}} The EPA has the ability to implement governmental regulations to insure that the public has access to water that is free of pharmaceutical pollution however, no laws have been enacted even though “ the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that some research has demonstrated potential impact on human health from exposure to pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, such as antibiotics and EE2 substances that interfere with human hormone development”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The EPA and other governmental agencies are not focused on this issue. They are not demanding any changes or regulations for Pharmaceutical pollution. They did not review the 3000 Pharmaceutical substances to determine their effect on human health.  There are no long term studies or health assessments created to examine how this affects us or the environment.

== Treatment methods ==
PPCPs are emerging pollutants, which pose potential risks on the environment and health. They are the result of many sectors, such as household consumption, industrial, farming, medicine, and aquaculture. However, because of the toxic and intractable characteristics, these pollutants cannot be removed by a traditional wastewater treatment plant in an effective way. Hence, they are becoming more and more universal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fact that conventional wastewater treatment processes could not eradicate PPCPs completely has been highlighted.

As such, environmental pollution caused by PPCPs are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the removal of PPCPs is an urgent topic in the treatment of wastewater. Up to now, the methods used for the removal of PPCPs can be roughly divided into three categories, including physical, chemical, and biological methods.

=== Physical adsorption processes ===
The most common physical process is adsorption. It is usually used to remove traceable organic pollutants in water. Generally, carbon-based materials, which include [[biochar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/biochar-takes-the-pharmaceuticals-out-of-urine/2500487.article|title=Biochar takes the pharmaceuticals out of urine|work=Chemistry World|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  activated carbon, graphene and graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes, are applied to absorb PPCPs from aqueous solution. Different materials have a different adsorption capacity for PPCPs. As for these materials, carbon nanotubes have the highest adsorption capacity, while the adsorption capacity adjusted with the surface chemistry and properties of carbon nanotubes. By comparison, activated carbon as a traditional adsorbent has a wide application in adsorption of PPCPs from wastewater. Although physical adsorption processes are regarded as an advanced technology, and developing fast in the field of treatment methods, there are still some problems that should be addressed in future research, like the production of carbon nanotubes, the high cost of graphene, and the absorption of macromolecular substances. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Biological degradation processes ===
Microbial degradation is regarded as an essential method for the removal of organic pollutants. The processes have numerous advantages, like economical input costs, and mild operational conditions. In these processes, microorganisms can make use of their metabolic functions to degrade the contaminants and in some cases several microbes cooperate with each other to achieve this goal. Pure cultures, mixed cultures, and activated sludge processes can be used in these processes, while an activated sludge process is widely used as a biological treatment in the conventional wastewater treatment plants. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Constructed wetlands show great promise and are discussed below.

=== Chemical advanced oxidation processes ===
Advanced chemical [[Redox|oxidation]] processes are effective in removing PPCPs from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include [[Ozone|ozonation]], [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton oxidation]], [[ionizing radiation]], and [[Ultraviolet|UV treatment]], are efficient in the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WANG|first=JIAN LONG|last2=XU|first2=LE JIN|date=2012-02|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater Treatment: Formation of Hydroxyl Radical and Application|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=251–325|doi=10.1080/10643389.2010.507698|issn=1064-3389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, ozonation is the most widely used oxidation method for the removal of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Combined chemical and biological methods ===
Because some PPCPs are highly resistant and toxic to microorganisms, it can be difficult for biological methods to eliminate them on their own. On the other hand, advanced chemical oxidation processes behave well in removing persistent pollutants, but the intermediates produced during the treatment process are sometimes more resistant to oxidation. Thus, if using one of these two methods to treat pollutants, the process requires long times and high energy inputs, resulting in a high cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to overcome the shortfalls of using a single method, combinations of biological and chemical processes have increasingly been applied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-12-01|title=Removal of diclofenac from surface water by electron beam irradiation combined with a biological aerated filter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969806X14001947|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|language=en|volume=105|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2014.05.019|issn=0969-806X|last1=He|first1=Shijun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianlong|last3=Ye|first3=Longfei|last4=Zhang|first4=Youxue|last5=Yu|first5=Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, advanced chemical oxidation processes are used for pre-treatment to transform persistent pollutants into the biodegradable intermediates. Then, biological methods are applied to degrade them. Combined systems are being shown to be efficient and cost effective. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
===Blister packs===
80% of pills in the world are packed with [[Blister pack|blister packaging,]] which is the most convenient type for several reasons.&lt;ref name=":0al"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pharmaceutical Blister Packaging, Part I: Rationale and Materials|last = Pilchik|first = Ron|date = November 2000|journal = Pharmaceutical Technology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 68–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with [[Aluminium|aluminum]] (Al) and [[paper]]. The Cavity consists of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyester]] (PET) or aluminum (Al).&lt;ref name=":0al" /&gt; If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be [[Recycling|recycled]] and the harmful effects to the [[Natural environment|environment]] can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.

Burning of blister packs directly causes [[air pollution]] by the [[combustion]] products of polypropylene ([C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), polyester ([C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and polyvinyl chloride ([CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). The combustion reactions and products of these chemicals are mentioned below.
[[File:The basic configuration of blister packaging.jpeg|thumb|304x304px|The basic configuration of blister packaging]]
[C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 9n/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +3n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 10n O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 10n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +4n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2n O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + n HCl + n CO

Even though polypropylene and polyester is harmful to the environment, the most [[Toxicity|toxic effect]] is due to the combustion of polyvinyl chloride since it produces [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) which is an irritant in the lower and upper [[respiratory tract]] that can cause adverse to human beings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toxicity of the pyrolysis and combustion products of poly(vinyl chlorides): A literature assessment|journal = Fire and Materials|date = 1987-09-01|issn = 1099-1018|pages = 131–142|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1002/fam.810110303|first = Clayton|last = Huggett|first2 = Barbara C.|last2 = Levin|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1229172|type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposal of blister packs as normal waste, will forbid recycling process and eventually accumulate in [[soil]] or water, which will result [[Soil contamination|soil]] and [[water pollution]] since [[Biodegradation|bio-degradation]] processes of compounds like PVC, PP and PET are very slow. As a result, [[Ecology|ecologically]] damaging effects like disturbances of the [[habitat]]s and movements can be seen. [[Ingestion]] by the animals, affect the secretion of [[Digestive enzyme|gastric enzymes]] and [[steroid hormone]]s  that can decrease the feeding [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and may also cause problems in [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate)|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/5/1/1|journal = Polymers|date = 2012-12-28|pages = 1–18|volume = 5|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/polym5010001|first = Hayden K.|last = Webb|first2 = Jaimys|last2 = Arnott|first3 = Russell J.|last3 = Crawford|first4 = Elena P.|last4 = Ivanova}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low [[pH]], aluminum can increase its [[solubility]] according to the following equation.

By employing proper disposal methods, all manufacturing materials of blister packs like PP, PE, PVC and Al can be recycled and the adverse effects to the environment can be minimized.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eco Friendly Pharmaceutical Packaging Material|last = Singh|first = Anupama|date = 15 September 2015|journal = World Applied Sciences Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1703–1716|last2 = Sharma, Pramod Kumar|first2 = Malviya, Rishabha;|issn = 1818-4952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though, the synthesis of these [[polymer]]s relatively simple, the recycling process can be very complex since the blister packs contain [[metal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and polymers together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Nail polish remover===
[[Nail polish remover]] has the ability to enter bodies of water and soil after entering landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to [[acetone]]'s high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/Chem%20and%20Society/IMF_Solutions/olIMF_solutions.htm|title=Intermolecular Forces and Solutions|website=employees.csbsju.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nail polish remover.jpg|thumb|310x310px|
Nail polish remover contains acetone. 
]]
Since nail polish remover is a solvent, it will dissolve in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere will increase the concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.

Nail polish remover can also enter the lithosphere by landfills and by precipitation. However, it will not bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21.pdf|title=Toxilogical Profile for Acetone|last=|first=|date=May 1994|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.

When nail polish remover evaporates, acetone enters the atmosphere in the gaseous phase. In the gaseous phase, acetone can undergo photolysis and breakdown into carbon monoxide, methane, and ethane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2415445|title=The Mechanism of the Gas Phase Photolysis of Acetone|first1=R.

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + hv → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO → CH4 + CH2COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → C2H6

A second pathway that nail polish remover can enter in the atmosphere is reacting with hydroxyl radicals. When acetone reacts with hydroxyl radicals, its main product is methylglyoxal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21-c5.pdf|title=Toxicological Profile for Acetone - Potential for Human Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methylglyoxal]] is an organic compound that is a by-product of many metabolic pathways. It is an intermediate precursor for many [[advanced glycation end-product]]s, that are formed for diseases such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. The following reaction occurs:

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + ·OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;→  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)COH + 3H+

=== Case study ===
[[File:Pearl River Delta Area.png|thumb|466x466px|The Location of the Pearl River Delta]]

==== Pearl River, South China ====
It is well known that releasing antibiotics into the water can lead to antibiotic resistance. In the recent decade, the Pearl River has been altered by antibiotics. A study found that concentrations of antibiotics were lower than those in the estuary, and decreased from the east side to the west side. A series of phenomena showed that the primary sources of antibiotics came from river tributaries and terrigenous sources and there were frequent human activities and hydraulic conditions along the west banks of the river. Seasonal variations happened in most of the detected antibiotics in water as well. Additionally, the TOC content of sediments, and the pH of water affected the performance of antibiotics. The highest concentrations of antibiotics were found downstream of Guangdong Province, which was affected severely by nearby densely populated megacities, like Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macau. These have an adverse impact on people there. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=The distribution and partitioning of common antibiotics in water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513004748|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=92|issue=11|pages=1410–1416|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.044|pmid=23628172|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liang|first1=Ximei|last2=Chen|first2=Baowei|last3=Nie|first3=Xiangping|last4=Shi|first4=Zhen|last5=Huang|first5=Xiaoping|last6=Li|first6=Xiangdong|hdl=10397/23573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The coast of Guangdong, South China ====
The coast of Guangdong is a place polluted by another representative contaminant, plastic debris. After an extended period of observation, scientists found that the beach was a place that would help the fragmentation of plastic debrisinto highly fragmented plastic particles that can attach to small organisms. Through the process of washback, the plastic debris may be transported into the water, and make an adverse impact on a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. It is noticeable that polystyrene (PS) foams and fragments, and microplastics account for a great percentage of plastic debris on the beach. Most of the polystyrenes degrade within a year on average, and could not be observed in deep beach sediment. Thus, coastal beaches store highly fragmented and degraded micro-plastics. However, they may be active and return to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Size distribution of stranded small plastic debris on the coast of Guangdong, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116314828|journal=Environmental Pollution|language=en|volume=220|issue=Pt A|pages=407–412|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.079|pmid=27717531|issn=0269-7491|last1=Fok|first1=Lincoln|last2=Cheung|first2=Pui Kwan|last3=Tang|first3=Guangda|last4=Li|first4=Wai Chin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An alternative best management practice for PPCPs treatment – the application of constructed wetlands ==
[[File:Structures of constructed wetlands.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Structures of constructed wetlands: (a) surface flow (SF-CW); (b) horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF-CW); and (c) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF-CW). ]]
In recent years, scientists have been trying to find a way to handle PPCPs, but most of the advanced treatment processes are too expensive to apply in large scale. As such, a low-cost alternative approach for PPCPs treatment is of great significance for the environment. Based on this purpose, increasing concerns have been raised on constructed wetlands, which are cheaper in construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring. Actually, constructed wetlands have been proved to be effective for removal of conventional contaminants in wastewater treatment. However, applying constructed wetlands to deal with these issues is a totally new application in the field. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GARCÍA|first=JOAN|last2=ROUSSEAU|first2=DIEDERIK P.

=== Important components of constructed wetlands ===

==== Substrate ====
Based on several researches and further analysis for various constructed wetlands, scientists found that gravel is the most common substrate materials for the removal of PPCPs in constructed wetlands.

==== Vegetation ====
Vegetation plays an important part in directly taking up several organic pollutants from wastewater in constructed wetlands. With the function of diffusion, the organic pollutants like PPCPs can be transported within plants. That means, theses pollutants cannot move into the plant tissues through the plant roots and some specific transporters. Generally, the physico-chemical characteristics of PPCPs, such as hydrophobicity, water solubility, and concentration, affect the diffusion of the compounds.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-15|title=Organic xenobiotics removal in constructed wetlands, with emphasis on the importance of the support matrix|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413001842|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|language=en|volume=252-253|pages=272–292|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.03.008|pmid=23542322|issn=0304-3894|last1=Dordio|first1=A.V.|last2=Carvalho|first2=A.J.P.|hdl=10174/9895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Effects of plants and microorganisms in wwconstructed wetlands for wastewater treatment|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975003001319|journal=Biotechnology Advances|language=en|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=93–117|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2003.08.010|pmid=14623046|issn=0734-9750|last1=Stottmeister|first1=U.|last2=Wießner|first2=A.|last3=Kuschk|first3=P.|last4=Kappelmeyer|first4=U.|last5=Kästner|first5=M.|last6=Bederski|first6=O.|last7=Müller|first7=R.A.|last8=Moormann|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being soaked up by plants, the degradation may happen in metabolism processes.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-08-01|title=Assessment of plant-driven removal of emerging organic pollutants by duckweed|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653510006363|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=80|issue=7|pages=687–692|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.05.045|pmid=20580410|issn=0045-6535|last1=Reinhold|first1=Dawn|last2=Vishwanathan|first2=Saritha|last3=Park|first3=Jung Jae|last4=Oh|first4=David|last5=Michael Saunders|first5=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activities of microbial populations, there are numerous biological processes occurring in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-06-01|title=Comprehensive assessment of the design configuration of constructed wetlands for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from urban wastewaters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410002757|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=12|pages=3669–3678|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2010.04.022|pmid=20494393|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Sidrach-Cardona|first3=Ricardo|last4=Martín-Villacorta|first4=Javier|last5=Bécares|first5=Eloy|last6=Bayona|first6=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-03-01|title=Assessment of full-scale natural systems for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater in small communities|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135409007052|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1429–1439|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.032|pmid=19913872|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Martín-Villacorta|first3=Javier|last4=Bécares|first4=Eloy|last5=Bayona|first5=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-12-01|title=Removal of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics from swine wastewater by a constructed macrophyte floating bed system|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971000232X|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|language=en|volume=91|issue=12|pages=2657–2661|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.036|pmid=20696518|issn=0301-4797|last1=Xian|first1=Qiming|last2=Hu|first2=Lixia|last3=Chen|first3=Hancheng|last4=Chang|first4=Zhizhou|last5=Zou|first5=Huixian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, the toxicity of PPCPs to plants is a nonnegligible issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dordio|first=Ana|last2=Ferro|first2=Raquel|last3=Teixeira|first3=Dora|last4=Palace|first4=Alfredo J.|last5=Pinto|first5=Ana P.|last6=Dias|first6=Cristina M.B.|date=2011-06-15|title=Study on the use ofTyphaspp. for the phytotreatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen|journal=International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=91|issue=7–8|pages=654–667|doi=10.1080/03067311003782708|issn=0306-7319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-01|title=Elimination of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes from swine wastewater in the vertical flow constructed wetlands|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513000544|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=91|issue=8|pages=1088–1093|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.007|pmid=23380031|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liu|first1=Lin|last2=Liu|first2=Chaoxiang|last3=Zheng|first3=Jiayu|last4=Huang|first4=Xu|last5=Wang|first5=Zhen|last6=Liu|first6=Yuhong|last7=Zhu|first7=Gefu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7999">In [[molecular biology]], '''[[exon]] skipping''' is a form of [[RNA splicing]] used to cause cells to “skip” over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code, leading to a truncated but still functional protein despite the genetic mutation.

==Exon-skipping mechanism==
{{See also|RNA splicing}}
Exon skipping is used to restore the [[reading frame]] within a gene. [[Gene]]s are the genetic instructions for creating a protein, and are composed of [[intron]]s and [[exon]]s. Exons are the sections of DNA that contain the instruction set for generating a protein; they are interspersed with non-coding regions called introns. The introns are later removed before the protein is made, leaving only the coding exon regions.

Splicing naturally occurs in [[pre-mRNA]] when introns are being removed to form mature-mRNA that consists solely of exons. Starting in the late 1990s, scientists realized they could take advantage of this naturally occurring cellular splicing to downplay genetic [[mutations]] into less harmful ones.&lt;ref name = "wahl"&gt;Wahl, Margaret.

The mechanism behind exon skipping is a mutation specific [[antisense oligonucleotide]] (AON). An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthesized short nucleic acid polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation site in the pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping.&lt;ref name = "hard"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AON binds to the mutated exon, so that when the gene is then translated from the mature mRNA, it is “skipped” over, thus restoring the disrupted reading frame.&lt;ref name = "hard"/&gt; This allows for the generation of an internally deleted, but largely functional protein.

Some mutations require exon skipping at multiple sites, sometimes adjacent to one another, in order to restore the reading frame. Multiple exon skipping has successfully been carried out using a combination of AONs that target multiple exons.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Exon skipping as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)==

Exon skipping is being heavily researched for the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD), where the muscular protein [[dystrophin]] is prematurely truncated, which leads to a non-functioning protein. Successful treatment by way of exon skipping could lead to a mostly functional dystrophin protein, and create a phenotype similar to the less severe [[Becker muscular dystrophy]] (BMD).&lt;ref name = "wahl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.muscular-dystrophy.org/about_muscular_dystrophy/research_faqs/612_what_is_exon_skipping_and_how_does_it_work What Is Exon Skipping and How Does It Work?] Muscular Dystrophy Campaign. N.p., 11 July 2009. Web. 05 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the protein that becomes compromised is dystrophin.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;  The dystrophin protein has two essential functional domains that flank a central rod domain consisting of repetitive and partially dispensable segments.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1986821|year=2007|author1=Aartsma-Rus|first1=A|title=Antisense-mediated exon skipping: A versatile tool with therapeutic and research applications|journal=RNA|volume=13|issue=10|pages=1609–1624|last2=Van Ommen|first2=G. J.|doi=10.1261/rna.653607|pmid=17684229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dystrophin’s function is to maintain muscle fiber stability during contraction by linking the extra cellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Mutations that disrupt the [[open reading frame]] within dystrophin create prematurely truncated proteins that are unable to perform their job. Such mutations lead to muscle fiber damage, replacement of muscle tissue by fat and fibrotic tissue, and premature death typically occurring in the early twenties of DMD patients.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"/&gt; Comparatively, mutations that do not upset the open reading frame, lead to a dystrophin protein that is internally deleted and shorter than normal, but still partially functional. Such mutations are associated with the much milder Becker muscular dystrophy. Mildly affected BMD patients carrying deletions that involve over two thirds of the central rod domain have been described, suggesting that this domain is largely dispensable.

Dystrophin can maintain a large degree of functionality so long as the essential terminal domains are unaffected, and exon skipping only occurs within the central rod domain. Given these parameters, exon skipping can be used to restore an open reading frame by inducing a deletion of one or several exons within the central rod domain, and thus converting a DMD phenotype into a BMD phenotype.	

The genetic mutation that leads to Becker muscular dystrophy is an [[in-frame deletion]]. This means that, out of the 79 exons that code for dystrophin, one or several in the middle may be removed, without affecting the exons that follow the deletion. This allows for a shorter-than-normal dystrophin protein that maintains a degree of functionality. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the genetic mutation is out-of-frame. Out-of-frame mutations cause a premature stop in protein generation - the ribosome is unable to “read” the RNA past the point of initial error - leading to a severely shortened and completely non-functional dystrophin protein.&lt;ref name = "aartsma" /&gt;

The goal of exon skipping is to manipulate the splicing pattern so that an out-of-frame mutation becomes an in-frame mutation, thus changing a severe DMD mutation into a less harmful in-frame BMD mutation.

Genetic testing, usually from blood samples, can be used to determine the precise nature and location of the DMD mutation in the dystrophin gene.

'''Experience design''' ('''XD''') is the practice of [[design]]ing products, [[business process|processes]], services, events, [[multichannel retailing|omnichannel]] journeys, and environments with a focus placed on the quality of the [[user experience]] and culturally relevant solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aarts|first=Emile H. L.|author2=Stefano Marzano|title=The New Everyday: Views on Ambient Intelligence|publisher=010 Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-90-6450-502-7|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta discipline, experience design draws from many other disciplines including [[cognitive psychology]] and [[perceptual psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[architecture]] and [[environmental design]], [[haptic communication|haptics]], [[product design]], [[strategic design]], [[information design]], [[information architecture]], [[ethnography]], [[marketing strategy|marketing]] and [[brand strategy]], [[strategic management]] and [[management consulting|strategy consulting]], [[interaction design]], [[service design]], [[storytelling]], [[agile software development|agile]], [[lean startup]], [[communication design|technical communication]], and [[design thinking]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Commercial context ==
In its commercial context, experience design is driven by consideration of the moments of engagement, or [[touchpoint]]s, between people and brands, and the [[idea]]s, [[emotions]], and [[memories]] that these moments create. Commercial experience design is also known as [[customer experience]] design. In the domain of [[marketing]], it may be associated with [[experiential marketing]]. Experience designers are often employed to identify existing touchpoints and create new ones, and then to score the arrangement of these touchpoints so that they produce the desired outcome.

== Broader context ==
In the broader environmental context, there is far less formal attention given to the design of the experienced environment, physical and virtual—but though it's unnoticed, experience design is taking place. [[Ronald Jones (interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]], describes the practice as working across disciplines, often furthest from their own creating a relevant integration between concepts, methods and theories. Experience designers design experiences over time with real and measurable consequences; time is their medium. According to Jones, the mission of Experience Design is "to persuade, stimulate, inform, envision, entertain, and forecast events, influencing meaning and modifying human behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varutstallning08.konstfack.se/interdisciplinary-studies/ronald-jones.html|title=Ronald Jones|publisher=Konstfack Vårutställning 2008|accessdate=2008-10-03}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within companies, experience design can refer not just to the experience of customers, but to that of employees as well. Anyone who is exposed to the space either physically, digitally, or second hand (web, media, family member, friend) may be considered in the application of XD. This includes staff, vendors, patients, visiting professionals, families, media professionals and contractors.

== Focus debated ==
There is a debate occurring in the experience design community regarding its focus, provoked in part by design scholar and practitioner, [[Don Norman]]. Norman claims that when designers describe people only as customers, consumers, and users, designers risk diminishing their ability to do good design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnd.org/dn.mss/words_matter_talk_about_people_not_customers_not_consumers_not_users.html|title=Words Matter. Talk About People: Not Customers, Not Consumers, Not Users|publisher=Don Norman's jnd website|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that experience is so totally an affective, subjective, and personal process—not an abstraction—it would be ironic, it's been argued, for experience designers, when designing experiences, to approach people merely as objects of commerce or cogs in a machine. Experience design, perhaps more than other forms of design, is transactive and transformative: every experience designer is an experiencer; and every experiencer, via his or her reactions, a designer of experience in turn. While commercial contexts often describe people as "customers, consumers, or users", this and non-commercial contexts might use the words "audience, people, and participants". In either case, for conscientious experience designers, this is merely a semantic difference.

==Inclusive experience==
A great design experience must be self-explanatory and emphasizes on a [[user journey]] from step to step in minimalistic manner. In a broader term, it is a branch of [[inclusive design]] and [[universal design]]. The purpose of inclusion in the context of [[experience architecture]] is to create technology and user interfaces accessible for wider audiences inclusive of full range of human diversity with respect to ability, gender, age and other forms of human difference.

This methodology is to achieve independent experience and accessibility for users who are aging, abled or disabled or impaired either by birth, natural or incurred through natural events. It requires exercising and creating interfaces or prototyping a [[lo-fidelity design]] for the physical world that makes actions and steps more self-explanatory, thereby removing layers of prerequisite requirements to access any digital system. Inclusive experience is an emerging and developing skill sets and standard elements in applications that are mass-produced for consumers, government and in other public domains.

== Multiple dimensions ==
Experience design is not driven by a single design discipline. Instead, it requires a cross-discipline perspective that considers multiple aspects of the brand/business/environment/experience  from product, packaging and retail environment to the clothing and attitude of employees. Experience design seeks to develop the experience of a product, service, or event along any or all of the following dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;Steve Diller, Nathan Shedroff, Darrel Rhea (2005): ''Making Meaning: How Successful Businesses Deliver Meaningful Customer Experiences''. New Riders Press {{ISBN|0-321-37409-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Duration (Initiation, Immersion, Conclusion, and Continuation)
* Intensity (Reflex, Habit, Engagement)
* Breadth (Products, Services, Brands, Nomenclatures, Channels/Environment/Promotion, and Price)
* Interaction (Passive &lt; &gt; Active &lt; &gt; Interactive)
* Triggers (All Human Senses, Concepts, and Symbols)
* Significance (Meaning, Status, Emotion, Price, and Function)
While it is unnecessary (or even inappropriate) for all experiences to be developed highly across all of these dimensions, the more in-depth and consistently a product or service is developed across them—the more responsive an offering is to a group's or individual's needs and desires (e.g., a customer) it is likely to be. Enhancing the [[affordance]] of a product or service, its interface with people, is key to commercial experience design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Floor hockey''' is a family of indoor [[hockey]] games. 5 variations exist: three variations in the style of [[ice hockey]], and the other two in the style of [[bandy]], one of which is called [[floorball]] in English speaking regions.
Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as [[roller sports]] under the title of [[roller hockey]]. [[Quad hockey]] uses [[quad skates]] and looks similar to bandy, while [[inline hockey]] uses [[inline skates]] and is of the ice hockey variation.
All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a
curved end.&lt;ref&gt;“Floor Hockey Rules,” http://sportsvite.com/sports/FloorHockey/rules{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floor hockey games differ from [[street hockey]] in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=158|chapter=floor hockey|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bandy in a training format known as [[dryland training]].

==History==
Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Samuel Perry Jacks]], better known as "Sam Jacks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportshall.ca/stories.html?proID=491&amp;catID=all&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in [[Toronto]]. His achievement was later recognized by the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. “Ice Hockey”&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[ringette]] was introduced as a sport in the Winter [[Special Olympics]] in 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1970, the [[Special Olympics]] added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floor Hockey: Sport History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110631/http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|archive-date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|publisher= Special Olympics – Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Ball Hockey Association]] (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey.&lt;ref&gt;“Canadian Ball Hockey Association History,” The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.&lt;ref&gt;“CBHA Who We Are”, The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor [[Puck (sports)|puck]], a ring made of felt or other material ( [[Gym Ringette]] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard [[ice hockey]], field hockey or [[bandy]] sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.

==Variations==

One variation, especially popular in [[Europe]], is [[floorball]]. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

Another variation, [[cosom hockey]], uses plastic sticks and pucks, while [[gym ringette]] uses circular rings and sticks with no blade.

[[Power hockey]] is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs.
Knee pads are required for the goal keeper

== Rules ==

Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code.

With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into overtime in order to determine a winner.  Overtime rules vary, but typically include [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]].

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced.  A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a [[power play (sport)|power play]], but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
*  Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
*  Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player’s forward progress by pulling him or her back
*  Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body
*  Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
*  High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
*  Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
*  Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind

Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,&lt;ref name="nirsa.org"&gt;“NIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,” Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, http://www.nirsa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Sports/IntramuralRules/im_floorhockey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

[[File:Flavoparmelia caperata - lichen - Caperatflechte.jpg|thumb|''[[Flavoparmelia caperata]]'', a species of foliose lichen, on a branch of a tree]]
[[File:Lichen Cross Section Diagram.svg|thumb|Cross section diagram of foliose lichen with layers: 1. Upper Cortex; 2. Algal layer; 3. Medulla oiio; 4. Lower cortex; 5. Rhizine]]

'''Foliose lichen''' is one of a variety of [[lichen]]s, which are complex organisms that arise from the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between [[Fungus|fungi]] and a [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] partner, typically [[algae]]. This partnership allows lichen to live in diverse climates that can range from cold, dry [[Mountain|mountains]] to wet, warm [[Valley|valleys]]. Lichens develop quite slowly with recorded growth rates of 0.01–27mm/year depending on the species. Their lifespan averages between 30 and 60 years (Armstrong &amp; Bradwell pg.3).

Lichens have a main body part called the [[thallus]], which is composed of [[hyphae]], and houses the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[Medulla (lichenology)|medulla]]. The cortex contains the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] cells while the medulla allows for [[gas exchange]] and makes up the bulk of the lichen's [[thallus]]. There are three main types of lichens: [[Crustose lichen|crustose]], foliose, and [[Fruticose lichen|fruticose]]. Foliose lichen are characterised by flattened leafy thalli, and an upper and lower cortex. Many have numerous layers, which are stratified, and aid in identifying different types.

Foliose lichens attach to surfaces by [[Hypha|hyphae]] in the lower cortex with smaller root like structures called [[rhizines]] (Lichens of North America Pg 3, 13). Lichens play an important role environmentally. They provide a food source for many animals such as [[deer]], [[Goat|goats]], and [[caribou]], and are used as building material for [[Bird nest|bird nests]]. Some species can even be used in antibiotics. They are also a useful indicator of atmospheric pollution level. (Daniel and Nicholas)

==Pollution==

There is a direct correlation between pollution and the
abundance and distribution of lichen. Foliose lichens are extremely sensitive
to [[sulphur dioxide]], which is a by-product of atmospheric pollution. Sulphur
dioxide reacts with the [[chlorophyll]] in lichen, which produces [[phaeophytin]] and
magnesium [[ion]]s. When this reaction occurs in plants the lichen will then have
less chlorophyll causing a decrease in respiration which eventually kills the
lichen (Hill 831–836).

==Weathering of rocks==
Minerals in rocks can be [[Weathering|weathered]] by the growth of lichens on exposed rock surfaces. This can be attributed to both physical and chemical processes. Lichen can chemically weather minerals such as calcite by producing [[organic acid]]s like [[oxalic acid]]. This reacts with minerals in the rock, dissolving them and weakening the rock. As a result of this many rocks that have or once had lichen growth exhibit extensive
surface corrosion.  By-products of this weathering are poorly ordered [[iron oxide]]s and amorphous [[Aluminosilicate|alumino-silica]] gels, the neoformation of crystalline metal oxalates and secondary clay minerals. Lichen physically weather rocks by penetrating the rock's small crevasses with their [[rhizoids]]. The expansion and contraction of the roots causes smaller cracks to expand. &lt;ref&gt;(Chen, Jie, Hans P. Blume, and Lothar Beyer)&lt;/ref&gt;

These combined processes – of chemical and physical weathering – also serve to deteriorate [[asphalt shingle]]s, with foliose lichen byproducts dissolving the [[limestone]] (calcium carbonate) used as filler and their rhizoids expanding cracks which develop in the shingles over time.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Teloschistes chryosophthalmus.JPG|thumb|Foliose lichen showing orange apothecia, collected near a California Live Oak ([[Quercus agrifolia]]) grove]]

The reproduction of foliose lichen can occur either asexually or sexually. The sexual reproduction requires both a fungal and photosynthetic partner. The photobiont once in symbionce with its fungal partner will not produce recognisable reproductive structures therefore it is up to the fungal partner to continue reproduction for the lichen.  In order for lichen reproduction to take place the fungal partner must produce millions of germinating spores which fuse to form a [[zygote]] that must then also find a compatible photobiont.  This photobiont will fuse with the zygote and live within the fungi creating a lichen. The fungal partner in most foliose lichen are ascomytes with spores called [[Ascocarp|ascomata]]. The fruiting bodies of lichen typically make up one of two shapes. Apothecia which look like disk or cup shaped and produce their spores on their upper surface. And perithecia which are shaped like flasks that enclose a spore producing layer with a hole at the top ( Brodo, Sharnoff, and Sharnoff). Since sexual reproduction is inefficient, lichen will reproduce asexually by [[vegetative reproduction]] when possible. Foliose lichen use [[Isidium|isidia]] which are cylindrical finger like protuberances from the upper cortex in which algal and fungal tissue is incorporated into. They are easily broken off and transported by wind where they will relocate and propagate forming a new lichen (Easton pg.&amp;nbsp;62).

==Environment and fecundity==

The life
history strategies of foliose lichens is directly related to their surrounding
communities. Studies have shown a shift from sexual to vegetative communities
with changes in environment. It was found that if sexual reproduction is
important for allelic diversity then habitats with high levels of disturbance
would have species with rapid life cycles and high reproductive output to
better respond to the changing habitat. Three types of foliose saxicolous
lichen were chosen for a study because they each dominated different
communities. They included ''Arctoparmelia
centrifuga, Xanthoparmelia viriduloumbrina,'' and ''Xanthoparmelia cumberlandia'' and resemble stress tolerant,
competitive and ruderal species relative to the communities they dominate. ''Xanthoparmelia viriduloumbrina'' is
considered to be stress tolerant because it occurred in the open mossy rock
community and had a lower reproductive output. The high amount of rock
weathering and few vascular plants indicate that the mossy rock community is an
exposed habitat. ''Xanthoparmelia
cumberlandia'' had vegetative dominance in the grassy rock community which
had moderate exposure compared to the other communities. In a more exposed
community this species showed the second highest dominance and high apothecia,
indicating that it is a ruderal species. ''Arctoparmelia
centrifuga'' dominated in the treed rock environment which has the greatest
species diversity and was the most competitive environment. ''A. centrifuga'' had a high abundance and
reproductive output in this environment, suggesting it is a competitor. Despite
these differences in species richness the study shows that there is uniformity
between the proportion of sexual and asexual propagules for macrolichens between
communities.

==Light exposure and growth==

[[File:Lisajcrni7.jpg|thumb|Foliose lichen on rock]]
The success of foliose lichen, especially [[old-growth forest]] lichen is dependent on the amount of light in the surrounding environment which dictates a delicate balance between growth potential and [[desiccation]] damage. ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' is an old-growth forest lichen which was transplanted to three different boreal forest stands to assess its biomass and area growth. The three stands had different amounts of light exposure, moistening and nutrient additions. The three forest habitats included (1) even-aged young and closed canopy stand, (2) old forest with gaps, (3) open clear-cut areas with sparse regeneration of scattered trees with no self shading branches. Each of these environments offered varying amounts of light exposure. Growth of L. pulmonaria was highest in open sites, in which the species normally does not occur naturally. Lack of light seems to be a strong limiting factor for the growth of L. pulmonaria. However, there is no simple relationship between site factors and light especially because lichens desiccate at different times of the day. At the same time, L. pulmonaria has a low tolerance to prolonged high light, during desiccation times it can neither repair damage nor acclimate.

[[File:Gillray Temperance 051126.jpg|thumb|[[James Gillray]]'s satirical print ''Temperance Enjoying a Frugal Meal''. [[George III]] is depicted with patched trousers and a chair covered with protective fabric, eating a simple boiled egg and using the tablecloth as his napkin. Winter flowers fill the unlit fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperance enjoying a frugal meal|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1477394&amp;partId=1|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Frugality''' is the quality of being frugal, sparing, thrifty, prudent or economical in the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of consumable [[resources]] such as [[food]], [[time]] or [[money]], and avoiding waste, lavishness or extravagance.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;{{cite web|title=frugal|url=http://www.leoyan.com/century-dictionary.com/cent2jpgframes.php?volno=03&amp;page=2393|work=Century Dictionary Online|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=A.M. (ed.)|title=Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary|year=1972|publisher=Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford American Dictionaries (computer application)|year=2005|publisher=Apple Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolf|first=Henry (ed.)|title=Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|year= 1980|publisher= Merriam|location=Springfield MA|isbn= 0-87779-398-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral science]], frugality has been defined as the tendency to acquire goods and services in a restrained manner, and resourceful use of already owned economic goods and services, to achieve a longer term [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lastovicka|first=J. L.|author2=Bettencourt, L. A.|author3= Hughner, R. S.|author4= Kuntze, R. J. |title=Lifestyle of the tight and frugal: Theory and measurement|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1999|volume=26|pages=85–98|doi=10.1086/209552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Common [[strategies]] of frugality include the reduction of [[waste]], curbing costly [[habituation|habit]]s, suppressing instant [[gratification]] by means of fiscal self-restraint, seeking [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], avoiding traps, defying expensive [[social norms]], detecting and avoiding [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertising, embracing cost-free options, using [[barter]], and staying well-informed about local circumstances and both market and product/service realities. Frugality may contribute to health by leading people to avoid products that are both expensive and unhealthy when used to excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Toney Smith, S.|author3=Segrist, D. J.|title=Too cheap to chug: Frugality as a buffer against college-student drinking |journal=Journal of Consumer Behaviour|year=2010|volume=9|pages=228–238|doi=10.1002/cb.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frugal living is mainly practiced by those who aim to cut expenses, have more money, and get the most they possibly can from their money.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, C. The Frugal Mind: 1,479 Money Saving Tips for Surviving the 1990s. Nottingham Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a ''[[philosophy]]'' in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) "expert" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Hamilton: "How to Succeed in Business," Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ontario County, N.Y., for 1867-8, Page 91 e.g. H. Child, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;

Different spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Richard Cartwright: "Environmental Theology", Page 169. Creekside Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Puritan]]s are examples of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mecklin, John M.: "An Introduction to Social Ethics, The Social Conscience in a Democracy", Page 254. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.&lt;ref&gt;Watkinson, William L.: "Frugality in the Spiritual Life", Page 7. F. H. Revell company, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[environmentalists]] who consider frugality to be a virtue&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fillmore Swain|Swain, George Fillmore]]; ''Conservation of Water by Storage'', [[Yale University Press]], 1915, p. 26 e.g.&lt;/ref&gt; through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. [[Henry David Thoreau]] expressed a similar philosophy in ''[[Walden]]'', with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while [[simple living|living simply]] in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David: "Walden", Page 184 e.g. T. Y. Crowell &amp; co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate world==
Frugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Phil: "http://freecheap.blogspot.com/" 2010&lt;/ref&gt; through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Woerner, Stephanie L.; "Networked at Cisco", Page 13. Center for eBusiness, Sloan School of Management, MIT, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.

C.|last = Mackay}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental factors and other external influences can also play a role in phenotypic variation.  Genetic architecture is a broad term that can be described for any given individual based on information regarding gene and allele number, the distribution of allelic and mutational effects, and patterns of [[pleiotropy]], [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]], and [[epistasis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several different experimental views of genetic architecture.  Some researchers recognize that the interplay of various genetic mechanisms is incredibly complex, but believe that these mechanisms can be averaged and treated, more or less, like statistical noise.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Genetical Theory Of Natural Selection|url = https://archive.org/details/geneticaltheoryo031631mbp|publisher = At The Clarendon Press|date = 1930-01-01|first = R. A.|last = Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers claim that each and every gene interaction is significant and that it is necessary to measure and model these individual systemic influences on evolutionary genetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg|alt=Genotype-Phenotype Map|thumb|A very simple genotype-phenotype map that only shows additive pleiotropy effects.]]
Genetic architecture can be studied and applied at many different levels.  At the most basic, individual level, genetic architecture describes the genetic basis for differences between individuals, species, and populations.  This can include, among other details, how many genes are involved in a specific phenotype and how gene interactions, such as epistasis, influence that phenotype.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010200 Line-cross analyses] and [[Quantitative trait locus|QTL analyses]] can be used to study these differences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This is perhaps the most common way that genetic architecture is studied, and though it is useful for supplying pieces of information, it does not generally provide a complete picture of the genetic architecture as a whole.

Genetic architecture can also be used to discuss the evolution of populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Classical quantitative genetics models, such as that developed by [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], are based on analyses of phenotype in terms of the contributions from different genes and their interactions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Genetic architecture is sometimes studied using a genotype-phenotype map, which graphically depicts the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genotype-Phenotype Maps|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/biot.2006.1.3.268|journal = Biological Theory|date = 2015-04-14|issn = 1555-5542|pages = 268–279|volume = 1|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/biot.2006.1.3.268|language = en|first = Peter F.|last = Stadler|first2 = Bärbel M. R.|last2 = Stadler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic architecture is incredibly important for understanding [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]] because it describes phenotypic variation in its underlying genetic terms, and thus it gives us clues about the evolutionary potential of these variations.  Therefore, genetic architecture can help us to answer biological questions about speciation, the evolution of sex and recombination, the survival of small populations, inbreeding, understanding diseases, animal and plant breeding, and more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolvability ==
[[Evolvability]] is literally defined as the ability to evolve.  In terms of genetics, evolvability is the ability of a genetic system to produce and maintain potentially adaptive genetic variants.  There are several aspects of genetic architecture that contribute strongly to the evolvability of a system, including autonomy, mutability, coordination, epistasis, pleiotropy, polygeny, and robustness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*  Autonomy:  the existence of quasi-independent characters with the potential for evolutionary autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adaptation|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=705323&amp;dopt=abstractplus|journal = Scientific American|date = 1978-09-01|issn = 0036-8733|pmid = 705323|pages = 212–218, 220, 222 passim|volume = 239|issue = 3|first = R. C.|last = Lewontin|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0978-212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Mutability:  the possibility that genetic mutation can occur.
*  Coordination:  a phenomenon such as development, during which many different genetic processes and changes happen at once.
*  [[Epistasis]]: a phenomenon in which one [[gene]] is dependent on the presence of one or more "modifier" genes.
*  [[Polygene|Polygeny]]: a phenomenon in which multiple genes contribute to a particular phenotypic character.
*  [[Pleiotropy]]: a phenomenon in which a single gene affects one or more phenotypic characteristics.
*  [[Mutational robustness|Robustness]]: the ability of a phenotype to remain constant in spite of [[Mutation|genetic mutation]].

== Examples ==
[[File:SkinColourModel.png|alt=Skin Color Model|thumb|A speculative framework for the evolutionary history underlying current-day phenotypic variation in human skin pigmentation based on the similarities and differences found in various genotypes.]]
A study published in 2006 used phylogeny to compare the genetic architecture of differing human skin color.  In this study, researchers were able to suggest a speculative framework for the evolutionary history underlying current-day phenotypic variation in human skin pigmentation based on the similarities and differences they found in the genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The genetic architecture of normal variation in human pigmentation: an evolutionary perspective and model|url = http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/suppl_2/R176|journal = Human Molecular Genetics|date = 2006-10-15|issn = 0964-6906|pmid = 16987881|pages = R176–R181|volume = 15|issue = suppl 2|doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl217|language = en|first = Brian|last = McEvoy|first2 = Sandra|last2 = Beleza|first3 = Mark D.|last3 = Shriver}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary history is an important consideration in understanding the genetic basis of any trait, and this study was among the first to utilize these concepts in a paired fashion to determine information about the underlying genetics of a phenotypic trait.

In 2013, a group of researchers used [[Genome-wide Association Studies|genome-wide association studies (GWAS)]] and genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) to determine the risk of [[congenital heart defect]]s in patients suffering from [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sailani|first=M. Reza|last2=Makrythanasis|first2=Periklis|last3=Valsesia|first3=Armand|last4=Santoni|first4=Federico A.|last5=Deutsch|first5=Samuel|last6=Popadin|first6=Konstantin|last7=Borel|first7=Christelle|last8=Migliavacca|first8=Eugenia|last9=Sharp|first9=Andrew J.|date=2013-09-01|title=The complex SNP and CNV genetic architecture of the increased risk of congenital heart defects in Down syndrome|journal=Genome Research|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1410–1421|doi=10.1101/gr.147991.112|issn=1549-5469|pmc=3759718|pmid=23783273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21.  The current hypothesis regarding congenital heart defect phenotypes in Down Syndrome individuals is that three copies of functional genomic elements on chromosome 21 and genetic variation of chromosome 21 and non-chromosome 21 loci predispose patients to abnormal heart development.  This study identified several congenital heart defect risk loci in Down Syndrome individuals, as well as three [[Copy-number variation|copy number variation (CNV)]] regions that may contribute to congenital heart defects in Down Syndrome individuals.

Another study, which was published in 2014, sought to identify the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders.  The researchers in this study suggested that there are a large number of contributing loci that are related to various psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gratten|first=Jacob|last2=Wray|first2=Naomi R.|last3=Keller|first3=Matthew C.|last4=Visscher|first4=Peter M.|date=2014-06-01|title=Large-scale genomics unveils the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=6|pages=782–790|doi=10.1038/nn.3708|issn=1546-1726|pmc=4112149|pmid=24866044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they, like many others, suggested that the genetic risk of psychiatric disorders involves the combined effects of many common variants with small effects - in other words, the small effects of a wide number of variants at specific loci add together to produce a large, combined effect on the overall phenotype of the individual.  They also acknowledged the presence of large but rare mutations that have a large effect on phenotype.  This study showcases the intricacy of genetic architecture by providing an example of many different SNPs and mutations working together, each with a varying effect, to generate a given phenotype.

Other studies regarding genetic architecture are many and varied, but most use similar types of analyses to provide specific information regarding loci involved in producing a phenotype.  A study of the human immune system in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roederer|first=Mario|last2=Quaye|first2=Lydia|last3=Mangino|first3=Massimo|last4=Beddall|first4=Margaret H.|last5=Mahnke|first5=Yolanda|last6=Chattopadhyay|first6=Pratip|last7=Tosi|first7=Isabella|last8=Napolitano|first8=Luca|last9=Terranova Barberio|first9=Manuela|date=2015-04-09|title=The Genetic Architecture of the Human Immune System: A Bioresource for Autoimmunity and Disease Pathogenesis|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867415002470/abstract|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=161|issue=2|pages=387–403|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.046|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4393780|pmid=25772697}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the same general concepts to identify several loci involved in the development of the immune system, but, like the other studies outlined here, failed to consider other aspects of genetic architecture, such as environmental influences.  Unfortunately, many other aspects of genetic architecture remain difficult to quantify.

Although there are a few studies that seek to explore the other aspects of genetic architecture, there is little ability with current technologies to link all of the pieces together to build a truly comprehensive model of genetic architecture.  For example, in 2003, a study of genetic architecture and the environment was able to show an association of social environment with variation in body size in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Jason B.|date=2003-04-15|title=Genetic architecture and evolutionary constraint when the environment contains genes|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/8/4655|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=100|issue=8|pages=4655–4660|doi=10.1073/pnas.0635741100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=153611|pmid=12640144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this study was not able to tie a direct link to specific genes involved in this variation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AT1403 map.png|thumb|right|Guinean mangroves]]
The '''Guinean mangroves''' are a coastal [[ecoregion]] of [[mangrove]] swamps in rivers and estuaries near the ocean of West Africa from [[Senegal]] to [[Sierra Leone]].

==Location and description==
{{see also|List of rivers of Guinea-Bissau}}
Guinean mangroves can be found: in the [[Saloum River]] and [[Casamance]] deltas in Senegal; in the lower [[Gambia]] River basin; much of the coast of [[Guinea-Bissau]], including the [[Cacheu River|Cacheu]] and [[Mansoa River]]s; across the border in northern [[Guinea]]; and much of the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] including the [[Sherbro River]]. Mangroves thrive on flat coastal inlets and [[estuary|estuaries]] where the ocean tides wash warm salt water high upriver, in this ecoregion as far as 100&amp;nbsp;km, for example in the [[Farim River|Cacheu River]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Guinean mangroves|id=at1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/j1533e/J1533E33.htm |title=Sierra Leone  |work=Status And Trends In Mangrove Area Extent Worldwide |publisher=FAO |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The mangroves have a varied composition with ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]'' and ''[[Conocarpus erectus]]'' growing up to 10m tall among larger areas of ''Rhizophora'' and ''[[Avicennia]]''. The tallest trees may be {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and form the equivalent of gallery forests along the creeks, the [[mudflat]]s between the creeks having much shorter trees. The inland fringes of the forest are clad in grasses, ferns and salt-loving plants.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; However, the flora in the ecoregion is not as biodiverse as that of East African mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==
Mangrove swamps are important feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the [[African manatee]]. Birds in these wet habitats include  [[Goliath heron]], [[purple heron]], [[cattle egret]], [[striated heron]], [[western reef heron]], [[greater flamingo]], [[lesser flamingo]], [[African spoonbill]], and [[African sacred ibis]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
Mangrove habitats are under threat as trees are cut down for timber and firewood or to clear land for agriculture including rice farming. This habitat is also under threat from the lower amounts of precipitation in the region over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; In southern Senegal, efforts are being made to replant the mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80906 |title=Senegal: Protecting livelihoods through mangroves |date=14 October 2008 |publisher=IRIN Africa |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas near the mangroves include the Gambian capital, [[Banjul]] and the Guinea-Bissau capital [[Bissau]]. National parks in the region include [[Saloum Delta National Park]] and [[Basse Casamance National Park]] in Senegal, [[Niumi National Park]] in Gambia, and Tarafes de [[Cacheu]] Natural Park in Guinea-Bissau. The Saloum [[river delta]] can also be accessed from the village of [[Foundiougne Department|Foundiougne]] in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier196/en/en_069_ni.pdf |title=Senegal's mangrove forests |author= |date= |work=Country report |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health Systems Engineering''' or '''Health Engineering''' (often known as "Health Care Systems Engineering (HCSE)") is an academic and a pragmatic discipline that approaches the [[health care]] industry, and other industries connected with health care delivery, as [[complex adaptive system]]s, and identifies and applies engineering design and analysis principles in such areas. This can overlap with [[biomedical engineering]] which focuses on design and development of various medical products; [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]] which involve improving organizational operations; and various health care practice fields like [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], etc.  Other fields participating in this interdisciplinary area include [[public health]], [[information technology]], [[management]] studies, and regulatory [[law]].

People whose work implicates this field in some capacity can include members of all the above-noted fields, many of which have sub-fields targeted toward health care matters even if health or health care is not a principal focus of the overall field (e.g. management, law). Areas of [[biomedical engineering]] (BME) in this area often include [[clinical engineering]] (sometimes also called "hospital engineering") as well as those BMEs developing [[medical devices]] and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.  The [[industrial engineering]] (IE) principles employed tend to include optimization, decision analysis, [[human factors engineering]], quality engineering, and value engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">The '''Information Management Body of Knowledge''' (IMBOK) is a management framework that organizes the concept of [[Information Management]] in the full context of business and organizational strategy, management and operations.  It is specifically intended to provide researchers and practicing managers with a tool that makes clear the conjunction of the worlds of information technology and the world at large.

==The IMBOK framework==

The IMBOK comprises six 'knowledge' areas and four 'process' areas.  The '''knowledge areas''' identify domains of management expertise and capability that are each distinctly different to the others, as shown in the figure.  The '''process areas''' identify critical activities that move the value from the left to the right.  For example:
* ''Projects'' transform ''Information technology'' into ''information systems'' by engineering technology components into systems that deliver the required functionality
* ''Business change'' management deploys ''information systems'' in ''business processes'' so as to improve the performance and capability of those business processes
* ''Business operations'' deliver the ''business benefits'' expected by stakeholders 
* ''Performance management'' ensures and oversees the delivery of benefits appropriate to an organization's strategic intentions.

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|center|600 px|This framework is the basis of organizing the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004.  This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]

==Origin==

The IMBOK was a major deliverable out of a research project at the [[University of the Western Cape]] in South Africa, funded by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].  It has been adopted as a standard Information Management and Information Systems course text in South Africa, Europe, North America and elsewhere.  A monograph describing the IMBOK was made available on the World Wide Web in 2004, but it has been withdrawn and republished in an extended form in a book:  [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 "Investing in Information"].&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of notable albums with controversial [[album art]], especially where that controversy resulted in the album being banned, [[censorship|censored]] or sold in packaging other than the original one.  They are listed by the type of controversy they were involved in.

==Nudity and sexuality==
&lt;!--IMPORTANT! If you add an album without providing a reference or providing an explanation for why or how its album cover is "controversial", THE ALBUM WILL BE REMOVED! See discussion page.--&gt;
* [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] – ''[[Love It to Death]]'' (1971)
** The album features a portrait of the original Alice Cooper band, with frontman [[Alice Cooper]] posed with his thumb protruding from underneath his cape as if it were his penis. The album was later reissued with Cooper's entire right arm airbrushed out of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |title=Banned in the U.S.A.: 20 Wildest Censored Album Covers |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2018-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520193123/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115 |archivedate=2018-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arca (producer)|Arca]] – ''[[Xen (album)|Xen]]'' (2014)
** The album cover is a [[computer-generated image|computer-generated]] androgynous alter-ego named Xen. With her head tilted back, Xen displays her broad shoulders, breasts, and large hips on the album cover with her skin rippling "as if about to peel and fall off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623100145/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/558-new-flesh-jesse-kandas-music-videos-subvert-the-myth-of-the-feminine-pristine/ |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though no genitals appear, [[Spotify]] and [[iTunes]] [[Pixelization|pixelate]] the area, as well as the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/album/5FLsmazQWaDK9JGqdzHlN4|title=Xen|date=3 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|title=Xen by Arca|date=4 November 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417200346/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/xen/id915861599|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biffy Clyro]] – ''[[The Vertigo of Bliss]]'' (2003)
** The cover shows a woman sitting down with her hand up her dress, presumably [[Masturbation|masturbating]], with a look of pleasure on her face. The controversy of the album cover is accompanied by the erotic artwork of the singles "[[The Ideal Height]]", "[[Questions and Answers (Biffy Clyro song)|Questions and Answers]]" and "[[Eradicate the Doubt]]" (all designed by [[Milo Manara]]). Despite being considered offensive and sexist by some, ''[[ShortList]]'' magazine praised the band for their bravery and originality when they mentioned it in their list of "50 Coolest Album Covers Ever".
* [[The Black Crowes]] – ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994)
** The album cover's depiction of [[pubic hair]], taken from an issue of ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine, caused controversy.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |title=The Black Crowes: Rock rebels take home-grown spirit on tour  |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |page=18 |date=March 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was replaced with a black background cover which blacked out the hair.
* [[Blind Faith]] – ''[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Blind Faith]]'' (1969)
** The cover featured a topless [[puberty|pubescent]] girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship, which some perceived as [[phallic]]. Photographer [[Bob Seidemann]] used a girl, Mariora Goschen, who was 11 years old.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Powell, Aubrey  |year=1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-0706-8  |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece Interview with Mariora Goschen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065455/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2870010.ece |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|title=Mariora Goschen|website=www.baacorsham.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608094747/http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/cached/MarioraGoshen.htm|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US record company issued it with an alternative cover which showed a photograph of the band on the front.
* [[Bon Jovi]] – ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986)
** The album originally was to feature a busty, 34DD woman in a wet yellow T-shirt with the album name on the front of the shirt. However, the artwork was rejected because record executives feared that the dominant record store chains at the time would not sell the album with a sexist cover, or [[Jon Bon Jovi]]'s complaint that the record company had put a bright pink border around the photograph that the band had submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|title=The Gauntlet - Top 10 Banned Metal Album Covers|website=www.thegauntlet.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727082844/http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/12753/top-10-banned-metal-album-covers.html|archivedate=2014-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|title=Bon Jovi – Most Shocking Album Covers|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215521/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bon-jovi-most-shocking-album-covers/|archivedate=2014-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the cover was changed before the album's release to an image of a wet garbage bag with the words "Slippery When Wet" written on it.
* [[Bow Wow Wow]] – ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'' (1981)
** The cover of the album features a rendition of [[Édouard Manet]]’s painting ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]]'' featuring the band members. The band's then-14-year old lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]] is nude on the cover. The cover caused outrage in the United Kingdom that led to an investigation by [[Scotland Yard]], instigated by Lwin's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig |last=McLean |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |title=Bow Wow Wow haven't lost their bite &amp;#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228130803/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/bow-wow-wow-leigh-gorman-annabella-lwin |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover was replaced, and never appeared on the American issue.
* [[Chumbawamba]] – ''[[Anarchy (Chumbawamba album)|Anarchy]]'' (1994)
** The cover originally depicted a baby's head emerging from a woman's vagina during birth. As some stores would not sell the album due to the cover, the baby image was replaced with an image of several flowers.
* [[Cradle of Filth]] – ''[[Thornography]]'' (2006)
** In news posted on the official Cradle of Filth website in mid-May 2006, it was revealed that the planned artwork for ''Thornography'' had been vetoed by [[Roadrunner Records]]. A replacement was soon forthcoming, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. The controversy was over the nakedness of the female figure's legs on the original cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |title=Blabbermouth - Cradle cover banned |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427202131/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cradle-of-filth-thornography-cover-banned-in-the-u-s/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bowie]] – ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1973)
** The album features Bowie as a half-dog half-man hybrid, and the back cover features the creature's genitals. Following controversy, later copies of the album have the genitals airbrushed out of the painting.&lt;ref name="stonelist"/&gt;
* [[Dead Kennedys]] – ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' (1985)
** A poster inserted in the original record sleeve, [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''Landscape #XX'', or ''[[Penis Landscape]]'', was a painting depicting rows of penises in sexual intercourse. The band and its record label [[Alternative Tentacles]] were brought to criminal trial for distributing harmful matter to minors.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven.

Additionally, the album's actual cover – a 1970s ''[[Newsweek]]'' photograph of [[Shriners]] in a parade – prompted a 1986 lawsuit from the four elderly Shriners included in the photograph.&lt;ref name=united-press-shriners-suit-1986&gt;{{cite news|title=Album Cover Prompts Suit From Shriners|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|accessdate=4 September 2015|agency=United Press International|publisher=Sun Sentinel|date=October 3, 1986|ref=united-press-shriners-suit-1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128065359/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-03/news/8602280346_1_four-shriners-record-store-album|archivedate=28 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Death Grips]] – ''[[No Love Deep Web]]'' (2012)
** The cover shows the erect penis of drummer [[Zach Hill]] with the album's title written in black marker. The cover caused such controversy, along with its spontaneous release without their label's permission, that the band were forced to put a disclaimer on their website. An alternative cover was subsequently released depicting a man wearing socks with the words "Suck my dick" on them.
* [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]] — ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' (1973)
** The cover was taken from a triptych by [[H. R. Giger]], which was produced based on ELP’s music. The artwork features a phallus below a woman’s chin, which was later airbrushed into a shaft of glowing light by another artist.
* [[Frenzal Rhomb]] – ''[[Dick Sandwich]]'' (1994)
** The cover shows several severed penises, some of which are being used as filling in a sandwich. They were subsequently banned from some venues and record stores.&lt;ref name="Nim"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20020415-0000/www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en3/frenzalrhomb/frenzalrhomb.htm | title = Frenzal Rhomb | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music.

* [[Gob (band)|Gob]] – ''Dildozer'' (1995)
** The cover for the EP depicted a crowd of people being chased through a city by a massive bulldozer with a [[penis]] attached to it. The cover also has the title with a penis in place of the "I". Many stores refused to carry the EP because of the cover. As of 2000, ''Dildozer'' is [[out of print]].
* [[Guns N' Roses]] – ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987)
** The album's original [[cover art]], based on [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]]' painting "Appetite for Destruction", depicted an open-shirted woman leaning against a wooden fence after clearly being raped by a robotic rapist which is about to be crushed by a dagger-toothed monster. After several music retailers refused to stock the album, the label compromised and moved the offending image to the inside sleeve, replacing it with a new image depicting a cross and skulls of the five band members.&lt;ref name="musicstak.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |title=Album cover info at |publisher=Musicstack.com |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817010302/http://www.musicstack.com/articles/historic-controversial-album-covers-part-two |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band stated the artwork is "a symbolic social statement, with the robot representing the industrial system that's raping and polluting our environment."&lt;ref name="AfDcover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |title=Geffen's Guns N' Roses Fires A Volley At PMRC |last1=Goldstein |first1=Patrick |date=August 16, 1987 |website=LATimes.com |access-date=June 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623121611/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/ca-1533_1_artwork |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Hotelier]] – ''[[Goodness (The Hotelier album)|Goodness]]'' (2016)
** The album cover shows a group of middle-aged [[naturism|nudists]] posing in the middle of a forest. The group consists of five women and three men. The album cover was completely pixelated for its iTunes release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|title=Goodness by The Hotelier|date=27 May 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607084954/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodness/id1093222186|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many online news outlets overlaid a black box over the explicit areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|title=The Hotelier - Goodness (Album Artwork/Track List/Vinyl Details)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617002600/http://www.soundinthesignals.com/2016/02/the-hotelier-goodness-album.html|archivedate=2016-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] – ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968)
** The intended artwork for the UK version of the album did not arrive in time to press the album, so a cover of naked women lounging in front of a black background was issued in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|title=6 Alternate Album Covers You Won't Believe Almost Happened|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829000053/http://www.cracked.com/article_20196_6-alternate-album-covers-you-wont-believe-almost-happened_p2.html|archivedate=2014-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[John Lennon]] &amp; [[Yoko Ono]] – ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'' (1968)
** The front cover displayed Lennon and Ono frontally nude, while the rear cover featured them from behind. Distributors were prompted to sell the album in a plain brown wrapper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html Yoko Ono] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502000218/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yoko_ono.html |date=2009-05-02 }}, Time magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the album were impounded as obscenity in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=StickeredStock&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christman|first=Ed|title=Stickered Stock: Retail's Reaction To Increased Responsibility|journal=Billboard|date=26 March 1994|page=42|volume=106|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]] - "[[Cold (Kanye West song)|Cold]]" (2012) (Single)
** The cover designed by [[George Condo]] features a woman body with bare [[breasts]]. It was intended to be the cover art of the song when the name was "Theraflu". When Kanye West changed the name of the song to "Cold", a new cover was revealed, which also caused controversies for bare breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|title=Kanye West's Theraflu changes title and artwork|publisher=HollywoodReporter|accessdate=June 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522041436/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/kanye-west-theraflu-name-change-way-too-cold-312198|archivedate=May 22, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kanye West]]  – ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010)
** The cover originally showed a painting by [[George Condo]] depicting West being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. As certain retail stores refused to sell the album due to the cover, Condo created a less-offensive artwork, showing a ballerina with a glass of cherry juice. However, many versions of the album still feature the original artwork, but pixelated.
* [[Led Zeppelin]] – ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973)
** The [[Hipgnosis]] cover, based on the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], features a group of naked children ascending the [[Giant's Causeway]]. The interior art also depicts a distant figure of a naked Overlord standing on mossy ruins (nearby [[Dunluce Castle]]) while holding one of the children aloft in a ceremonial gesture. Although the album was originally released with the nudity intact, [[Atlantic Records]] were allowed to add a wrap-around paper title band to US and UK copies of the sleeve that had to be broken or slid off to access the record.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|0-7119-3528-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hid the children's buttocks from general display, but still the album was either banned or unavailable in some parts of the Southern United States for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dangerousage.com/householy.html Classic Rock Covers: Led Zeppelin; ''Houses of the Holy''.

* [[Lady Gaga]] – ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013)
** The album artwork is a sculpture of Lady Gaga by [[Jeff Koons]] with her legs open and a [[Yard globe|gazing ball]] placed between them. Although no nudity is visible on the artwork, the album cover was still censored in the [[Middle East]] and [[China]]. Rather than traditional [[censorship]], the gazing ball between her legs was enlarged to fully cover her breasts, and her legs were colored black so they don't appear naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP cover gets photoshopped for censored China release|website=www.gigwise.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623094057/http://www.gigwise.com/news/87840/lady-gagas-artpop-cover-gets-photoshopped-for-censored-china-release|archivedate=2015-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lady Gaga]] – "[[Do What U Want]]" featuring [[R. Kelly]] (2013) (Single)
** The single cover is a close-up of Lady Gaga's buttocks wearing a blue, floral [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]. Lady Gaga's blonde wig hangs just above her thong-clad buttocks. The image was taken by photographer [[Terry Richardson]]. A censored version of the cover featuring a pale mauve coloured skirt edited over the top of her buttocks was used in selected countries in the [[Middle East]].
* [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] – ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998)
** The cover shows a picture of a naked [[Marilyn Manson]] with airbrushed genitalia. Some retail stores, including [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]], refused to stock the album.
* [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] – ''[[Dark Side of the Spoon]]'' (1999)
** The album's cover depicts a naked obese woman seated in front of a blackboard where the words "I will be god" are written numerous times. The album was banned from [[Kmart]] due to the offending cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |title=Ministry's Dark Side Of The Spoon (1999) was banned by Kmart due to its cover. |date=2007-10-26 |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125054719/http://www.mtv.com/photos/warning-these-album-covers-may-contain-explicit-content/1572579/2643346/photo.jhtml |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the album's insert, the same woman covers her breasts with her hands, and her [[Buttocks|behind]] is also exposed on both the insert and back cover. The woman and the words on the blackboard were later airbrushed out.
* [[Mom's Apple Pie]] – ''[[Mom's Apple Pie]]'' (1972)
** The album was originally released with the album cover featuring a woman licking her lips and holding a pie with a slice removed showing a subtle depiction of a woman's [[vulva]] and some [[semen]] leaking from the pie. The cover was later reprinted with the vulva replaced by a miniature brick wall, topped with razor wire and removing the semen.
* [[Nicki Minaj]] – "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]" (2014) (Single)
** The artwork for this digital single depicts the subject with her back towards the camera, emphasizing her [[Thong (clothing)|thong]]-clad buttocks. Some stores censored this art by obscuring the buttocks with the [[Parental Advisory]] seal, or a black box on the edited version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|title=Nicki Minaj's Anaconda cover artwork: too racy for its own good?|first=Tshepo|last=Mokoena|date=25 July 2014|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120170558/http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/25/nicki-minaj-anaconda-cover-too-sexy-instagram|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] – ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991)
** The album cover featured a naked baby with his penis exposed, swimming after a dollar bill. Chain stores such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] initially refused to carry ''Nevermind''. However, eventually due to such high demand, Nirvana compromised and put a sticker that read "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile" over the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad 1993, p. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana saw continued controversy for their next album, ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''.
* [[NOFX]] – ''[[Heavy Petting Zoo]]'' (1996)
** The album features two covers, one for the CD version and one for the LP version; both of them caused controversy. The CD version features a man sitting down on the ground in a petting zoo cuddling a sheep with his hand on the sheep's genitalia area. The LP version sparked even more controversy than the CD version, as it features the same man in a [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] with the same sheep. The album is known as ''Eating Lamb'' on the LP. The LP version was banned from [[Germany]] due to the cover's subject matter.
* [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] – ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989)
** The album cover features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while singer [[Anthony Kiedis]]' standing body conceals the other. Several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A stricter censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original.&lt;ref name=apterartwork&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rob Zombie]] – ''[[Mondo Sex Head]]'' (2012)
** The cover features a nude female's buttocks, but after controversy arose, it was replaced by an image of a cat, which was referred to as a "[[pussy]] shot".&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web| title = Rob Zombie Unveils 'Mondo Sex Head' Album Art| work = [[Rolling Stone]]| date = July 2, 2012| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| accessdate = November 10, 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130105232311/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rob-zombie-on-his-new-album-art-20120702| archivedate = January 5, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Waters]] – ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' (1984)
** The cover features a rear-view and nude image of model and pornography actress [[Linzi Drew]]. It was condemned by many feminist groups and was also accused of promoting rape. [[Columbia Records]] was forced to place a black box covering the nudity for future releases to avoid more controversy.
* [[Roxy Music]] – ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974)
** The album features scantily clad models Constanze Karoli and Eveline Grunwald – the sister and girlfriend, respectively, of [[Can (band)|Can]] guitarist [[Michael Karoli]] – posed in front of a bush. Although no nudity is directly shown in the photograph, Grunwald is topless. For a later American release of the album, the front cover was replaced by mirroring the photograph on the album's back cover, which features the foliage and forest, but neither woman.&lt;ref name="billboardlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Banned Album Covers {{!}} Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|website=Billboard|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920201101/http://www.billboard.com/photos/426842/20-banned-album-covers/1|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] – ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' (1976)
** This cover featured a photo of a naked [[puberty|prepubescent]] girl, with her pubic area partially obscured by a "cracked glass" effect.  Her pose and the title "Virgin Killer" added to the image's notoriety. The [[Internet Watch Foundation]], a British non-profit group who provides content blacklists for major [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] in the country, also notably [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|blacklisted]] pages on [[Wikipedia]] for featuring the cover on its article about the album.&lt;ref name="efluxmedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_UK_Censors_Wikipedia_Article_with_Nude_Girl_Album_Cover_30919.html |title=UK Censors Wikipedia Article with Nude Girl Album Cover |first=Eric |last=Blair |work= |accessdate=9 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002806/http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_UK_Censors_Wikipedia_Article_with_Nude_Girl_Album_Cover_30919.html |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This block was later retracted due to technical problems which occurred as a result of the blocking mechanisms and due to the already "wide availability" of the image.&lt;ref name="c42"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/iwf+lifts+wikipedia+ban/2878257|title=IWF lifts Wikipedia ban|date=9 December 2008|work=[[Channel 4 News]]|publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]|accessdate=10 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AkVJZ3hj?url=http://www.channel4.com/news/|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Suede (band)|Suede]] – ''[[Suede (album)|Suede]]'' (1993)
** The gender-ambiguous cover art provoked controversy in the press,&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;"[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/music/article.html?Past_Mercury_Music_Prize_winners&amp;in_article_id=706475&amp;in_page_id=25 Past Mercury Music Prize winners"]. ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''. Retrieved on 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Anderson to comment, "I chose it because of the ambiguity of it, but mostly because of the beauty of it." The cover image of the androgynous kissing couple was taken from the 1991 book ''Stolen Glances: Lesbians Take Photographs'' edited by Tessa Boffin and Jean Fraser. The photograph was taken by [[Tee Corinne]] and in its entirety shows a woman kissing an acquaintance in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="B114"&gt;Barnett, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Strokes]] – ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001)
** The original cover art featured a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it. Although British retail chains [[HMV]] and [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment.&lt;ref name="strokes"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Miles, Barry |editor2=Scott, Grant |editor3=Morgan, Johnny |title=The Greatest Album Covers of All Time|year=2008 |page=251|publisher=[[Anova Books]]|isbn=1-84340-481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the band's native United States, the cover was changed to a photograph of [[subatomic particle]] tracks in a [[bubble chamber]]. This decision was made by frontman [[Julian Casablancas]] because he liked this image more than the original cover, and was independent of any controversy or label demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|title=Hear &amp; Now|author=Willman, Chris|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425175122/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The cover features a stained-glass image of an African-American [[Jesus]] wearing a red bandanna across his lower face, a [[Jesus Piece (jewelry)|Jesus piece]] necklace, and a [[teardrop tattoo]]. After the [[Roman Catholic Church]] complained to [[Interscope Records]] about the cover, Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition and use a different cover for the standard edition. The standard cover features a black-and-white photo of the rapper's deceased brother Jevon Danell Taylor, who died on May 21, 1995 at the age of 20 after being shot.
* [[Jimi Hendrix]] – ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967)

** An alternative cover was reportedly created by Justin Bieber's team for his ''Purpose'' album after several Muslim nations across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] as well as [[Indonesia]], took issue with Bieber being shirtless in the original artwork and flaunting his cross tattoo, promoting Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Bieber Purpose album cover banned in Middle East for promoting Christianity|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/justin-bieber-purpose-album-cover-banned-middle-east-promoting-christianity-1523812|website=IB Times|date=October 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016024157/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/justin-bieber-purpose-album-cover-banned-middle-east-promoting-christianity-1523812|archivedate=October 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The cover depicts a mutilated, stoned [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] in a sea of blood with mutilated heads. For stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover, an alternative cover was provided instead.

* [[Steve Taylor]] – ''[[I Predict 1990]]'' (1987)
** The album's cover, influenced by early 20th century French [[Neo-impressionism|neo-impressionist]] poster art and painted by Taylor's wife, was controversial with some Christian retailers who instead believed it to be a reference to [[tarot]] and [[New Age]] philosophy. The album was pulled from several stores as a result.&lt;ref name="WD_145"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Doug |title=Door Magazine, This Is Your Life!

Some Christian bookstores which did not pull the album for its cover pulled it due to the song or its title, either because its critique of the pro-life movement offended store owners and customers, or because these same individuals missed the song's satirical point, and believed Taylor advocated such violence.&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''; Powell; p931; Hendrickson Publishers; paperback edition (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tenacious D]] – ''[[Tenacious D (album)|Tenacious D]]'' (2001)
** The album cover received controversy due to its parody of [[The Devil (Tarot card)|the Devil tarot card]]. On the back of the CD were two babies locked to Satan. This caused the album to be pulled from many stores and in later US copies of the CD the babies were airbrushed out. Though for the July 2002 CD release of the album in the UK and also the 2013 re-release on vinyl, the babies were kept in.

* [[Matchbox Twenty]] – ''[[Yourself or Someone Like You]]'' (1996)
** The album's cover depicts a man with glasses wearing a shirt on his left shoulder and a pilot hat. Frank Torres, the man featured on the cover image sued the band in May 2005, claiming Matchbox Twenty had no permission from him to use his photo on the album's cover and that the photo had been the cause of mental anguish. Torres justified the delay in suing Matchbox Twenty by claiming he had only seen the album photo within the last two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=5778 Matchbox Twenty sued over album cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527022404/http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=5778 |date=2005-05-27 }}.

* [[Negativland]] – ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]'' (1991)
** The cover features the album title, "U2", as a very large logo, with the band's name in small text beneath the album. [[Island Records]] sued the band for the use of the misleading album cover because "U2" is trademark of the label. The songs on the album were controversial too, as they were versions of [[U2]]'s song "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" which were copied without permission.
* [[Richard Pryor]] – ''[[Richard Pryor (album)|Richard Pryor]]'' (1968)
** The debut album of comedian Richard Pryor was recorded live at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood, California. The cover was art-directed and designed by [[Gary Burden]]. According to Burden, "As a result of the Richard Pryor album cover, which I loved doing, I got two letters: One was a letter from the [[National Geographic Society]]’s attorneys offering to sue me for defaming their publication. The second letter was a [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy nomination]] for the best album cover."&lt;ref&gt;[http://garyburdenforrtwerk.com/2009/09/richard-pryor/ Richard Pryor | Gary Burden For R.

** The original pressing of the album featured an inner sleeve containing many black and white photos of both the band members as well as other celebrities, all strategically positioned to show through cut-out holes on the outer sleeve. After protests from some of the persons depicted, the inner sleeve was revised to replace the offending photos with color blocks and text reading ''Pardon Our Appearance'' and ''Cover Under (Re)Construction''.
* [[Sonic Youth]] – ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' (1987)
** The album's artwork has been edited two separate times to obscure images; the first of which was a [[Richard Avedon]] image depicting a 12-year-old girl, due to a lawsuit threat. The other instance was when an image of the [[Disney]] [[Magic Kingdom]] was deliberately covered with a barcode, likely due to copyright complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)#Packaging]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}}

** The cover art, taken in the 1980s, features a blond girl staring into the camera with an unidentifiable expression on her face. In July 2010, the band and their label were sued by the model, Kirsten Kennis.

* [[The Beatles]] – ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' (1966)
** In early 1966, photographer [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]] had the Beatles in the studio for a [[conceptual art]] piece titled ''A Somnambulant Adventure''. For the shoot, Whitaker took a series of pictures of the group dressed in butcher smocks and draped with pieces of meat and body parts from plastic baby dolls. The group played along as they were tired of the usual photo shoots—Lennon recalled the band having "boredom and resentment at having to do ''another'' photo session and ''another'' Beatles thing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312254643|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the concept was compatible with their own black humour.&lt;ref name="Anthology"&gt;The Beatles.

* [[Cannibal Corpse]] – Various albums (1990–2006)
** [[Death metal]] band Cannibal Corpse's albums were all banned from Germany until 2006 due to their graphic album covers and disturbing lyrics. The band was also forbidden to play any songs from those albums while touring in Germany. This prohibition was not lifted until June 2006. In an interview from 2004, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban: "A woman saw someone wearing one of our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it. So [now] we can't play anything from the first three records. And it really sucks because kids come up and they want us to play all the old songs — and we would — but they know the deal. We can't play 'Born in a Casket' but can play 'Dismembered and Molested."&lt;ref name=innerview&gt;{{cite web|last=Falina|first=Melanie|title=Cannibal Corpse Just Wants to Sing About Ripping Apart Human Flesh in Peace|work=Chicago Innerview|publisher=Innerview Media, Inc|date=February 2004|url=http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/feb04_cannibal_corpse.htm|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311003400/http://www.chicagoinnerview.com/archives/feb04_cannibal_corpse.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tombreview&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Tyler|title=Reviews of Cannibal Corpse's 'Tomb of the Mutilated' (1992)|url=http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|publisher=tombofthemutilated.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013080058/http://www.tombofthemutilated.net/Cannibal-Corpse-Tomb-Of-The-Mutilated-Review.html|accessdate=February 6, 2009|archivedate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CKY (band)|CKY]] – ''[[Volume 1 (CKY album)|Volume 1]]'' (1999)
** The cover originally depicted a stylized cartoon depiction of [[R. Budd Dwyer]]'s live television suicide. After many complaints of offensiveness, the label forced the band to replace the offensive cover with a black and white cut-out of one of the band's live performances. The album was released with the band's original name Camp Kill Yourself, which was switched to CKY.&lt;ref name="dwyer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/future-shock-she-wants-revenge-the-donnas-cky-and-more-6595143 |title=Future Shock: She Wants Revenge, The Donnas, CKY, And More |last=Leatherman |first=Benjamin |publisher=''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519204543/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/future-shock-she-wants-revenge-the-donnas-cky-and-more-6595143 |archivedate=May 19, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Coup]] – ''[[Party Music]]'' (2001)
** The original cover art, designed in June 2001, depicted Boots Riley and Pam the Funkstress destroying the [[Twin Towers (NYC)|Twin Towers]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]], the group postponed the album's release until November of that year, with the record now sporting an alternate cover depicting a hand holding a flaming martini glass.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=8708 |title=The Coup's Bomb |last=Goedde |first=Brian |publisher=''The Stranger'' |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911223817/http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=8708 |archivedate=September 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green Day]] – ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1992)
** The cover features a white picture (with some green added in) of a teenage girl wearing a flower shirt holding a smoking gun. The back cover features a boy lying on the ground with a gunshot wound on his back. Retail stores such as [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] initially refused to carry ''Kerplunk''. The band saw continued controversy on their next album ''[[Dookie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/10/ranking-every-green-day-album-from-worst-to-best/full-post/ |title=Ranking: Every Green Day Album from Worst to Best |date=2016-10-07 |website=[[Consequence of Sound]] |language=English |access-date=2017-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216201122/https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/10/ranking-every-green-day-album-from-worst-to-best/full-post/ |archivedate=2017-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green Day]] – ''[[Dookie]]'' (1994)
** The cover art shows an animated picture of dogs throwing bombs and dirt on people and buildings and a huge explosion with the band's name on top of the cloud. A blimp on the left in the sky says "Bad Year" (possibly a parody of the [[Goodyear Blimp]]) and on the right is a man with a harp in a cloud. Retailers [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of this. Despite the controversy, no alternative cover has existed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, later printings of the album edited the back cover for copyright reasons, airbrushing out a puppet of [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] from ''[[Sesame Street]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|title=Ernie From Sesame Street Had To Be Airbrushed Off The Back Cover Of The Green Day Album “Dookie”|date=31 March 2011|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214105/http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/03/31/ernie-from-sesame-street-had-to-be-airbrushed-off-the-back-cover-of-the-green-day-album-dookie/|archivedate=17 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ice-T]] – ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' (1993)
** The album's cover depicted a white boy listening to rap music in the midst of a home invasion in which Blacks are attacking Whites (presumably the boy's parents). [[Sire Records]], owned by [[Time Warner]], refused to release the album with the cover, and Ice-T left the label as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Opinion'', Ice-T as dictated to Heidi Siegmund, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] – ''[[Street Survivors]]'' (1977)
** The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, standing in the street of a town engulfed in flames. Three days after the album was released, three of the band members were killed in a plane crash due to fuel exhaustion. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve Gaines' widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background.  Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original "flames" cover was restored.&lt;ref name=Check-Six&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxpnRuHV?url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manic Street Preachers]] – ''[[Journal for Plague Lovers]]'' (2009)
** The album art depicts a painting by [[Jenny Saville]].  A number of UK supermarkets deemed the red/[[ochre]] colours on the portrait to be blood, and therefore used alternative packaging to stock the item.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets Manic Street Preachers album cover censored by supermarkets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420234758/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/manic-street-preachers-album-supermarkets |date=2017-04-20 }} The Guardian, 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative packaging in question is a [[longbox]], a type of outer packaging used for some CDs in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.
* [[Metallica]] – ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983)
** The album was originally set to be titled ''Metal Up Your Ass'', with the cover featuring a toilet bowl with a hand clutching a dagger emerging from it. However, at the request of [[Megaforce Records]] (who thought the original album title would be inappropriate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |title=ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA – Complete history |publisher=Encycmet.com |date=September 3, 1983 |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710070554/http://www.encycmet.com/biography/ |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the band changed the album title to ''Kill 'Em All''. They also changed the artwork, this time depicting a shadow of a hand releasing a bloodied hammer.
* [[The Offspring]] – ''[[The Offspring (album)|The Offspring]]'' (1989)
** The album's original artwork depicted an image of a man's body exploding as the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] from the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise holding a [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar emerges from his chest. The album was reportedly banned for being "too grotesque",&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt; and on the 1995 reissue, the artwork was replaced by a blurry black-and-white picture of a man. It was later admitted that the band and their studio never really liked the original artwork.
* [[Pink Floyd]] – ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975)
** The artwork depicts two men shaking hands in an alley at [[Warner Bros. Studios]], with one on fire. As some retailers deemed it "too violent" and refused the sell the album, the cover was replaced on some re-releases with a black background featuring the album's four-elements sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|title=10 Banned Album Covers|first=Rachel|last=Thompson|work=The Telegraph|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626155420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11574460/10-banned-album-covers.html?frame=3287295|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The Mamas and the Papas]] – ''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]'' (1966)
** The album cover, which features the four members in a bathtub, also featured a toilet in the far right corner. The inclusion of this toilet was controversial for the time and copies with the cover were pulled due to complaints of indecency. The copies were re-issued with a text-box pasted on top of the toilet. Later issues of the album feature both the toilet and the bathtub cropped out entirely.&lt;ref name="stonelist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|title=Banned in the U.S.A.: 20 Wildest Censored Album Covers|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930142116/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/banned-in-the-u-s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-20150115|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Rolling Stones]] – ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968)
** The original album cover featured a toilet wall which had been defaced. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards defaced the toilet wall themselves. The album cover was rejected by Decca, and kept out of shops until a new album cover was designed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/photos/the-rolling-stones-album-artwork-secrets-revealed-the-story-behind-every-sleeve-1416155]&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] – ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' (1993)
** When ''In Utero'' was released, there were many objections to the song "[[Rape Me]]", despite the band's claims that the lyrics were "anti-rape." Retailers [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Kmart]] refused to sell the album because of the back cover artwork (featuring model fetuses), so a "clean" version was released for them which featured an altered version of the back cover and listed the title "Rape Me" as "Waif Me", though the song remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info/general&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm#96 Nirvana fan club FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055629/http://www.nirvanaclub.com/get.php?section=info%2Fgeneral&amp;file=nfc_faq2.htm |date=2017-11-07 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html Banned albums of the 90s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621101224/http://ericnuzum.com/banned/incidents/90s.html |date=2007-06-21 }} Retrieved on 10 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The band acquiesced to the demands to change the artwork because members [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] were only able to buy music from the two chain stores as children; as a result they wanted to "make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".&lt;ref&gt;Gordinier, Jeff.

* [[Arctic Monkeys]] – ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006)
** The cover sleeve showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band, smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in [[Scotland]] for "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK".&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4677356.stm BBC News:Arctic Monkeys defend album cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225201050/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4677356.stm |date=2008-12-25 }} Retrieved on 5 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">'''Map algebra''' is a set-based [[algebra]] for manipulating [[geographic]] data, proposed by Dr. [[Dana Tomlin]] in the early 1980s.  It is a set of primitive operations in a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) which allows two or more [[Raster graphics|raster]] [[Layers (digital image editing)|layer]]s ("maps") of similar dimensions to produce a new raster layer (map) using algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction etc.

Depending on the spatial neighborhood, GIS transformations are categorized into four classes: ''local'', ''focal'', ''global'', and ''zonal''. Local operations works on individual raster cells, or [[pixel]]s. Focal operations work on cells and their neighbors, whereas global operations work on the entire layer. Finally, zonal operations work on areas of cells that share the same value. The input and output for each operator being map, the operators can be combined into a procedure or script, to perform complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographic Information Systems and Science|author=Longley|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|ISBN=978-0-470-72144-5|pages=414–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When map algebra is performed in cells from local operations, different types of operations can be used:
* Arithmetic operations uses basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Statistical operations uses statistical operations such as minimum, maximum, average and median.
* Relational operations compares cells using functions such as greater than, smaller than or equal to.
* Trigonometric operations uses sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine between two or more raster layers.
* Exponential and logarithmic operations use exponent and logarithm functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GISGeography|title=Map Algebra-Global, Zonal, Focal and Local Functions|url=http://gisgeography.com/map-algebra-global-zonal-focal-local/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major GIS systems use map algebra concepts, including [[ERDAS Imagine]] and [[ArcGIS]]. ArcGIS 10 implements Map Algebra in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]; functions are imported Python methods and Python's overloading capability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3.4. Special method names¶|url=https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html|website=The Python Language Reference|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for operators. For example, rasters can be multiplied using the "*" arithmetic operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esri|first1=Inc.|title=ArcGIS 10.0 Help|url=http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00p600000002000000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some examples, in [[MapBasic]]:
&lt;source lang="MapBasic"&gt;

#  development – 0: vacant, 1: major, 2: minor, 3: houses, 4: buildings, 5 cement

  where 1 replaces 4 5 6
  where VOID replaces ...

# create layer unifying water and development

  where water replaces VOID

notbad = LocalRating of occupied and toosteep
  where 1 replaces VOID and VOID
  where VOID replaces ... and ...

roads = LocalRating of development

The '''Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik''' ("MPI for Nuclear Physics" or MPIK for short) is a
research institute in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]].

The institute is one of the 80 institutes of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] (Max Planck Society), an independent, non-profit research organization. The Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics was founded in 1958 under the leadership of Wolfgang Gentner. Its precursor was the Institute for Physics at the MPI for Medical Research.

Today, the institute's research areas are: crossroads of particle physics and astrophysics (astroparticle physics) and
many-body dynamics of atoms and molecules (quantum dynamics). There are five scientific divisions and several further research groups and junior groups. Scientific and technical departments as well as the administration support the researchers. The institute has about 390 employees, as well as many diploma students and scientific guests.

The research field of Astroparticle Physics, represented by the divisions of [[Werner Hofmann (physicist)|Werner Hofmann]] and [[Manfred Lindner]], combines questions related to macrocosm and microcosm. Unconventional methods of observation for gamma rays and neutrinos open new windows to the universe. What lies behind “dark matter” and “dark energy” is theoretically investigated.

The research field of Quantum Dynamics is represented by the divisions of [[Klaus Blaum]], [[Christoph Helmut Keitel|Christoph Keitel]] and [[Thomas Pfeifer]]. Using reaction microscopes, simple chemical reactions can be “filmed”. Storage rings and traps allow precision experiments almost under space conditions. The interaction of intense laser light with matter is investigated using quantum-theoretical methods.

Further research fields are cosmic dust, atmospheric physics as well as fullerenes and other carbon molecules.

Scientists at the MPIK collaborate with other research groups in Europe and all over the world and are involved in numerous international collaborations, partly in a leading role. Particularly close connections to some large-scale facilities like [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research|GSI]] (Darmstadt), [[DESY]] (Hamburg), [[CERN]] (Geneva), [[TRIUMF]] (Canada), and [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN]]-[[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|LNGS]] (Assergi L‘Aquila) exist.

In the local region, the Institute cooperates closely with the University of Heidelberg, where the directors and further members of the Institute are teaching. Three International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) and a graduate school serve to foster young scientists.

The institute operates accelerators (12 MeV Tandem, 15 MeV high-current injector, 25 MeV linear postaccelerator) injecting highly charged atomic ions or molecular ions into a storage ring (TSR). The electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) is able to produce and store 78-fold charged mercury ions.

The '''Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory''' is a laboratory located 500 metres underground in [[Bure, Meuse|Bure]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] [[département]]. It allows study of the geological formation in order to evaluate its capacity for [[deep geological repository]] of high-level and long-lived medium-level [[radioactive waste]]. It is managed by [[Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs]] (Andra).

Since radioactive waste needs to be safely stored for extreme lengths of time, the geology of the area is of utmost importance.  Geologically, this site chiefly consists of [[Kimmeridgian]] [[claystone]] 500 metres underground in the [[Paris Basin]]. It is expected that by 2025, medium-level waste would be stored near Bure.

==History==
The first practical geological studies on locations for deep geological repository in France date back to the 1960s. In the 1980s Andra, at that time a branch of the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]], was given the task of investigating possible locations for an underground research laboratory.

===Site selection===
Two geological formations were initially considered in the 1990s: [[clay]] and [[granite]].  The 1991 law thus dictated that research would be done in several possible sites.

In 1994, work by Andra investigated a wide range of locations in 4 separate [[départements]], and further narrowed down the choice to 3 locations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Layout==
All above and below ground facilities at the site are organized around two wells.

===Surface installations===
There are [[headframe]]s above each well for transporting equipment and people in and out.  Then there is a host of other surface buildings and factories for research, which occupy a total of 170,000 square metres.  The reception building has a [[Green roof]].

===Tunnels===
As of 2007, a 40 metre long tunnel had been completed at the 445 m underground level, while almost 500 m of tunnels have been excavated at the 490 m underground level. Further extensions were built between 2007 and 2009 and more are scheduled, to be completed by 2015.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Retrievability==
French law stipulates that for the first few hundreds of years the stored material must be safely retrievable, insofar as future Frenchmen may find it useful.  The storage facility is therefore being designed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rob Broomby |title=How France is disposing of its nuclear waste |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26425674 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |work=BBC |date=4 March 2014 |quote=French law requires companies to build a retrievable scheme, meaning that for the first few hundred years at least, they can remove the waste again should future generations find a better way to get rid of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in essence a sub-field of [[cultural informatics]]&lt;ref name="cultural-informatics"&gt;[http://www.pratt.edu/academics/information_and_library_sciences/program_concentrations/cultural_informatics/ Cultural informatics], School of Library and Information Science, [[Pratt Institute]], New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; at the intersection of [[culture]], [[digital technology]], and [[information science]]. In the context of the digital age facilitating growing commonalities across museums, libraries and archives, its place in academe has grown substantially and also has connections with [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/ Digital humanities].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest references to museum informatics in English are from ''[[Archives and Museum Informatics]]'' a newsletter and journal published on the subject from 1987–1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archimuse.com/publishing/AMInewsletter.html Archives &amp; Museum Informatics Newsletter (1987–1996)].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, museum informatics projects and services developed at numerous American universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/text/CNC9344.txt Lessons From The Berkeley Museum Informatics Project], CAUSE. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural informatics was introduced into library and information science education in 2000 at the [[Pratt Institute]] School of Library and Information Science in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name="cultural-informatics" /&gt; Graduate courses devoted to museum informatics were offered from at least 2001.&lt;ref name="LIS" /&gt; PhD theses were using "museum informatics" in the title by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts, Nicholas, [http://www.unige.ch/cyberdocuments/theses2004/CroftsN/these.pdf Museum informatics : the challenge of integration], [[University of Geneva]], Switzerland, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, an academic reader, ''Museum Informatics: People, Information, and Technology in Museums'', edited by Paul F. Marty and Katherine Burton Jones, was published as part of the [[Routledge]] Studies in Library and Information Science.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Overview==
Museum informatics is an emerging field of academic study focused on the intersection between information technologies, museums and their staff members, and online museum data and services. The more general cultural informatics deals with, for example, information design and interaction, [[digital curation]], [[cultural heritage]] description and access, [[social media]], and the application of digital tools. Museums have embraced the application of museum informatics which has been supported by [[United States|US]] federal grants and in particular by the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pratt.edu/academics/information_and_library_sciences/grant_scholarship_internship/chart/Project CHART], [[Pratt Institute]], New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The older term "[[museum studies]]" refers more to traditional curatorial perspectives rather than relating to the use of [[information science]] and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name="mip"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mip.berkeley.edu/ | title=Museum Informatics Project (MIP) | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]], USA | accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Archives and Museum Informatics]]'' is a leading journal in the field of museum informatics. University courses relating to [[museology]] include a component on museum informatics.&lt;ref name="LIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gslis.org/index.php?title=Museum_Informatics | title=LIS 490MUG / LIS490MUU Museum Informatics | publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], USA | work=[http://www.gslis.org/wiki/GSLIS Graduate School of Library and Information Science] (GSLIS) | year=2007 | accessdate=August 2, 2011 |author1=Heidorn Bryan  |author2=Twidale, Michael |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marty.cci.fsu.edu/lis5590/ | title=LIS 5590 Museum Informatics | publisher=[[Florida State University]], USA | year=2011 | accessdate=August 2, 2011 | author=Marty, Paul F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN) in the United States holds an annual conference and runs the MCN-L [[electronic mailing list]]. The [[Museums Computer Group]] (MCG) in the United Kingdom also holds meetings relevant to museum informatics.
The [[ICHIM]] conference series in [[Europe]] and the [[Museums and the Web]] conference series in [[North America]] cover aspects of museum informatics. 
Other relevant conferences include the [[EVA Conferences]].
Books are available on the subject.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book | title=Museum Informatics: People, Information, and Technology in Museums | publisher=[[Routledge]] Studies in Library and Information Science |author1=Marty, Paul F.  |author2=Jones, Katherine Burton  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780824725815/ | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-8247-2581-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Wired Museum: Emerging Technology and Changing Paradigms |publisher=[[American Association of Museums]] | editor=Jones-Garmil, Katherine | year=1997 | isbn=0-931201-36-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of collaborative projects in the field of museum informatics such as [[AMICO]], [[Artstor]], the Museum Informatics Project (MIP),&lt;ref name="mip" /&gt; and [[steve.museum]].
The [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM), through [[Cary Karp]], was instrumental in initiating the "[[.museum]]" [[top-level domain]] for museums on the [[Internet]].
Companies such as [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] in Canada and [[Cogapp]] in the United Kingdom help museums in using information technology effectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33278">'''Normality''' is a [[behavior]] that can be normal for an individual (intrapersonal normality) when it is consistent with the most common behaviour for that person. Normal is also used to describe individual behaviour that conforms to the most common behaviour in society (known as [[conformity]]). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation – it changes along with changing societal standards and [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]].  In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven James|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=9780313399312|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=otwxtVaj_O0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Normality+does+not+equal+mental+health:+The+need+to+look+elsewhere+for+standards+of+good+psychological+health.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being [[Inclusion (value and practice)|included]], excluded or [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] by larger society.

== Definitions ==
Normality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition.

===Statistics===
In general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average.  The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a [[normal distribution]] describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm.  When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%.  However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example,  the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The normal, the natural, and the harmonic|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=March 2007|volume=74|issue=3|pages=391–398|url=http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2006.07.003|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085907/http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see [[1.96]]). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^269 is approximately 0.000001&lt;/ref&gt;  For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^59 is approximately 0.048&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.{{clarify|what is the relevance of this?  For instance, is this bounding what it means to be socially normal to 59 traits, or is it simply saying nothing can be technically "normal" when 60 variables are in play?--the latter statement seems much more concise than what is currently stated in the article.|date=August 2018}}

===Durkheim===
The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] indicated in his ''Rules of the Sociological Method'' that it was necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality.  He suggested that behaviors or "social facts" which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Émile|title=Rules of Sociological Method|year=1982|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-907940-9|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Durkheim's model of normality further explained that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, exists under every society through every time period, and so should be considered normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Robert Alun|title=mile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works|year=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=60–81|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/rules.html#pgfId=2822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as  [[criminals]], will invite a punishment from others in the society.

===Influence of social norms===
Individuals' behaviours are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those [[norm (social)|social norms]]. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behaviour. In some cases of [[pluralistic ignorance]], most people falsely believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view.

When people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a [[descriptive norm]] (a norm describing what is done), their behaviour changes to become closer to that norm.  The power of these norms can be harnessed by [[Social norms approach|social norms marketing]], where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behaviour, such as binge drinking.  However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behaviour to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption.  Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use  [[injunctive norms]].  Instead of describing what behaviour is most commonly done, an injunctive norm is what is approved or disapproved of by society.  When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behaviour (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=P. Wesley|author2=Jessica M. Nola |author3=Robert B. Cialdini |author4=Noah J. Goldstein |author5=Vladas Griskevicius |title=The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms|journal=Psychological Science|date=May 2007|volume=18 | issue = 5|pages=429–434|url=https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/118375.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x |pmid=17576283|hdl=10211.3/199684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone.  Behaviours that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or [[subculture]].  For example, normal college student behaviour may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behaviour may be to go to church and pursue religion related activities.  Subcultures may actively reject "normal" behaviour, instead replacing society norms with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter|author2=Kelsey Ebben |title=Students Serving Christ: Understanding the Role of Student Subcultures on a College Campus|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=January 2008|volume=32|issue=2|pages=138–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
A disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical "normal" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony.  Individuals may monitor and adapt their behaviour in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=PRESENTATION OF SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE|year=1959|publisher=DOUBLEDAY &amp; COMPANY INC|location=NY|url=http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skopalová|first=Jitka|title=Social eviations, Labelling, and Normality|journal=Human Affairs|year=2010|volume=20|issue=4|pages=327–337|doi=10.2478/v10023-010-0034-8|url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/a17053485p84802w/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Many difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors – biologists come across parallel issues when defining normality.  One complication which arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachbroit|first=Robert|title=Normality as a Biological Concept|year=1994|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=579–591 |doi=10.1086/289823}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People say "This heart is abnormal" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the abnormal description.  There can be a difference between the normality of the structure and function of a body part.  Similarly, a behavioural pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual.  Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behaviour, it may be difficult to measure its normality.  This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the DSM.

== Social Norms ==
What is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as "an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syristová|first=Eva|title=A Contribution to Phenomenology of the Human Normality in the Modern Time|year=2010| publisher=Dordrecht: Springer Science + Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all-encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict "normalness" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the "normal" way that these rituals are performed shift and a new procedure becomes the normal one.

As another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behaviour varies greatly across time and place.  In many countries, perceptions on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality.  Social understanding on normal sexual behaviour also varies greatly country by country – countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal.  The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal.  Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive.  [[Gayle Rubin]]'s 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Todd G.|author2=Travis A. Ryan |author3=Lisa Fox |author4=Daragh T. McDermott |author5=Melanie A. Morrison |title=Canadian university students' perceptions of the practices that constitute "normal" sexuality for men and women|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|year=2008|volume=17 | issue = 4|pages=161–171|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_4_17/ai_n31903471/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.

{{anchor|interpersonal}}

==Intrapersonal==
Most definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviours to distinguish normality from abnormality.  Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behaviour for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hur|first=Taekyun |author2=Neal J. Roese |author3=Jae-Eun Namkoong|title=Regrets in the East and West: Role of intrapersonal versus interpersonal norms|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.1111/j.1467-839X.2009.01275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of many different occurrences of behaviour from one person over time.  Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behaviour).

It is most comfortable for people to engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms.  When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behaviour leading up to the mishap.  After a car crash, people may say "if only I didn't leave work early", blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catellani|first=Patrizia|author2=Augusta I. Albertici |author3=Patrizia Milesi |title=Counterfactual thinking and stereotypes: The nonconformity effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=34|issue=4|pages=421–436|doi=10.1002/ejsp.206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[counterfactual thinking]] particularly associates abnormal behaviour with negative outcomes.

== Medicine ==
In [[medicine]], behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, [[health]]y patient.  A person without any [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Mental Illness|url = https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|website = Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation (Formerly NARSAD)|accessdate = 2015-12-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135329/https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|archive-date = 2015-12-22|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation stated that "an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older – about 1 in 4 adults – suffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 10 Forms of Psychiatric Institution Abuse {{!}} CCHR International|url = http://www.cchrint.org/2014/11/13/top-10-forms-of-psychiatric-institution-abuse/|accessdate = 2015-12-10|date = 2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC reported that "cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses".  In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Neglect of Mental Illness Exacts a Huge Toll, Human and Economic|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-neglect-of-mental-illness/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuronal and synaptic ==
Hebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent [[synaptic runaway]].&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbib|first=M. A.|title=The handbook of brain theory and neural networks|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of [[dendrite|dendritic]] associations, which reduce sensory or behavioural acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission.

Animal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information.&lt;ref name="Arbib"/&gt;

Some researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5–2&amp;nbsp;Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state.&lt;ref name="Tononi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tononi|first=Giulio|title=Giulio Tononi: 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science Symposium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbyITI13zg|work=In search of sleep function|publisher=Allan Institute for Brain Science|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep.&lt;ref name="Tononi"/&gt;

Also, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behaviour dysfunction, or death, of that organism.

==Effects of labeling==
When people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or [[social stigma|stigmatization]].  Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large.  Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgens|first=Ruth|title=Disability and Being 'Normal': A Response to McLaughlin and Goodley: Response|journal=Sociology|date=5 August 2009|volume=43|pages=753–761|doi=10.1177/0038038509105419|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/753|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves.  Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Since being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to [[conformity|conform]] to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included.  For example, families and the medical community will try to help [[disability|disabled]] people live a normal life.  However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict – sometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling.  When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension.  A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals.  Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]], especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When an individual's abnormality is labelled as a [[pathology]], it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the [[sick role]] or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses.  Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Clinical ==
Applying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically.
Related to the previous definition, statistically normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45%  percent of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thibaut|first=John W.|title=The concept of normality in clinical psychology|journal=Psychological Review|year=1943|volume=50|issue=3|pages=4–7|doi=10.1037/h0062556}}&lt;/ref&gt; So at a group, or macro level, of analysis; abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey, but at an individual level abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in someway that needs to be corrected.
Statistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. 
It is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM ===
Normality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from  true disorders. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version DSM-I in by the APA,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version, DSM-5 in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between [[mental illness]] and normal mentality. Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR even wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of "normal" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness in his book, ''Saving Normal''.

Most of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of  possible normal [[symptom]]s, appropriate as contextually derived.&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Allan V.|title=Transforming Normality into Pathology: The DSM and the Outcomes of Stressful Social Arrangements|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2007|volume=48|issue=3|pages=211–222|doi=10.1177/002214650704800301|pmid=17982864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-II ===

The second edition of the DSM, DSM-II, could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]].&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; No distinction between abnormal to normal was established.

Evidence of the classification ambiguity were punctated by the [[Rosenhan experiment]] of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders.&lt;ref name="DSMII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Second edition|year=1968|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behaviour which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example; a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense [[grief]] for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

Another characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-11|journal=The American Psychiatric Association|year=1973|volume=6th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness.&lt;ref name="change"/&gt; Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt; However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either.  This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt;

=== DSM-III ===

DSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline, from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that  all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM-IV ===

[[DSM-IV#DSM-IV .281994.29|DSM-IV]] explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors.  Included in DSM-IV's classification is that  a mental disorder  "must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi)
This had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; The example set by DSM-III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013.  It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the [[Asperger's]]/[[autistic spectrum]] classifications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Criticisms of diagnostics ===
Since the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioural diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. 
The easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication, and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

[[Image:KoreanPineSeeds.jpg|right|thumb|[[Korean Pine]] nuts — shelled, and shell, above; unshelled, below]]
A '''nutshell''' is the outer shell of a [[nut (fruit)|nut]]. Most nutshells are inedible and are removed before eating the nut meat inside.

==Usage==
Most nutshells are useful to some extent, depending on the circumstances. [[Walnut]] shells can be used for cleaning and polishing, as a filler in [[dynamite]], and as a paint thickening agent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walnut#Shells|"Walnuts as a filler in dynamite, thickening agent, and polisher."]], ''Wikipedia Walnut Article'', accessed November 07, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shells from [[pecans]], [[almonds]], [[Brazil nuts]], [[acorn]]s, and most other nuts are useful in [[composting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums2.gardenweb.com/forums/load/soil/msg1113573723935.html "Composting Nut shells."], ''GardenWeb'', accessed November 07, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their high [[porosity]] makes them also ideal in the production of [[activated carbon]] by [[pyrolysis]].         

Shells can also be used as loose-fill packing material, to protect fragile items in shipping.

==Idiomatic usage== &lt;!-- "Nut graph" links here. --&gt;
The expression "in a nutshell"  (of a story, proof, etc.) means "in [[essence]]", [[metaphor]]ically alluding to the fact that the essence of the nut - its [[Eating|edible]] part - is contained inside its shell. The expression further gave rise to the [[journalism|journalistic]] term ''[[nut graph]]'', short for ''nutshell paragraph''.

In ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 2, Scene 2) the title character exclaims: "O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a King of infinite space".

Older uses of this have been reported, too. It is said to have been used by [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Lautenbach: ''Latein-Deutsch: Zitaten-Lexikon'', Quellennachweise, Münster, LIT, 2002, {{ISBN|3-8258-5652-6}}, S. 343&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned in the encyclopedic [[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historia]] a report by [[Cicero]] saying that a handwritten version of the ''[[Iliad]]'' by [[Homer]] would have fit in a nut[shell]: ''"in nuce inclusam Iliadem Homeri carmen in membrana scriptum tradit Cicero"''.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalis historia, 7, 21, 85; [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalis_Historia/Liber_VII#.5B85.5D Wikisource-Digitalisat]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">'''Organography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|όργανο}}, ''organo'', "[[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]"; and {{lang|grc|-γραφή}}, ''[[wiktionary:-graphy|-graphy]]'') is the scientific description of the structure and function of the organs of living things.

==History==
Organography as a scientific study starts with Aristotle, who considered the parts of plants as "organs" and began to consider the relationship between different organs and different functions. In the 17th century Joachim Jung,&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Jung, Isagoge phytoscopica (1678)&lt;/ref&gt; clearly articulated that plants are composed of different organ types such as root, stem and leaf, and he went on to define these organ types on the basis of form and position.

In the following century Caspar Friedrich Wolff &lt;ref&gt;Caspar Friedrich Wolff, Theoria generationis (1759)&lt;/ref&gt; was able to follow the development of organs from the "growing points" or apical meristems. He noted the commonality of development between foliage leaves and floral leaves (e.g. petals) and wrote: "In the whole plant, whose parts we wonder at as being, at the first glance, so extraordinarily diverse, I finally perceive and recognize nothing beyond leaves and stem (for the root may be regarded as a stem). Consequently all parts of the plant, except the stem, are modified leaves."

Similar views were propounded at by Goethe in his well-known treatise.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Goethe, Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklaren (1790)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "The underlying relationship between the various external parts of the plant, such as the leaves, the calyx, the corolla, the stamens, which develop one after the other and, as it were, out of one another, has long been generally recognized by investigators, and has in fact been specially studied; and the operation by which one and the same organ presents itself to us in various forms has been termed Metamorphosis of Plants."

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==
The three core tenets of permaculture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Greenblott | first1 = Kara | first2 = Kristof | last2 = Nordin | year = 2012 | title = Permaculture Design for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming: Low-Cost, Sustainable Solutions for Food and Nutrition Insecure Communities | place = Arlington, VA | publisher = USAID | series = AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR-One | number = Task Order 1 | url = http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mollison | 1988 | p =2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: Principles &amp; Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn = 0-646-41844-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.  See Dave Jacke's work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds, specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Guilds | accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | publisher = The Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi= 10.1098/rspb.1998.0336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge effect===
The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10. Edge Effect|date=3 April 2013|newspaper=Deep Green Permaculture|language=en-US|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark. [http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 "Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease"]. Permaculture Research Institute of Australia. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked. [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Joel Salatin]] have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start [[ecological succession]] or prepare ground for planting. [[Allan Savory]]'s [[holistic management]] technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to [[rangeland management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last= Fairlie | publisher= Chelsea Green | year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-60358325-1 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris| url= http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404| work= The Sunday Times | date =  4 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ash|first=Andrew|others=et al.|title=The Ecograze Project – developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|isbn=0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=7 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052228/http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url= http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title | work = CNET | accessdate =7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081104/http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Littman|first= Margaret|title= Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners |work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title= Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/ |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title= Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm | year = 1988 | title = Public Service | type = biography | contribution = Masanobu Fukuoka | publisher = The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation | place = [[The Philippines|PH]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Permaculture Action'''&lt;/big&gt;

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming. The action of permaculture looks and all becoming consciously involved in the process of producing and ensuring abundant food nearby, problem on malnutrition caused by the world hunger problem will inevitably lessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasarinlan|first=|year=2011|title=Permaculture as Alternative Agriculture|url=http://www.journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/kasarinlan/article/viewFile/3511/pdf_149|journal=Philippine|volume=26|pages=422–434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture principles in action are powerful forces to help right the environmental wrongs of the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solscape.co.nz/permaculture-sustainability/|title=Permaculture and Sustainability - Solscape|work=Solscape|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

[[File:Helianthus annuus pollen 1.jpg|thumb|right|Helianthus annuus pollen]]
'''Pollen zones''' are a system of subdividing the [[last glacial period]] and [[Holocene]] paleoclimate using the data from [[pollen core]]s. The sequence provides a global chronological structure to a wide variety of researchers, such as [[geology|geologists]], [[climatology|climatologisist]]s, [[geography|geographers]] and [[archaeologist]]s, who study the physical and cultural environment of the last 15,000 years.

==History==
The palynological aspects of the system were first investigated extensively by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[palynology|palynologist]] [[Lennart von Post]] in the years before the [[World War I|First World War]]. By analysing pollen  in [[core sample]]s taken from [[peat]] bogs, von Post noticed that different plant species were represented in bands through the cores.

The differing species and differing quantities of the same species are caused by changes in climate. Von Post was able to confirm the [[Blytt-Sernander]] climatic sequence showing fluctuations between warmer and colder periods across thousands of years. He used local peat sequences combined with [[varve]] dating to produce a regional climatic chronology for [[Scandinavia]].

In 1940 [[Harry Godwin]] began applying von Post's methods to pollen cores from the [[British Isles]] to produce the wider European sequence accepted today. It basically expanded the Blytt-Sernander further into the late [[Pleistocene]] and refined some of its periods. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the technique spread to the Americas.

Currently scientists are focusing a repertory of several different methods on [[core sample]]s in peat, ice, lake and ocean bottoms, and sediments to achieve "high resolution" dating not possible to only one method: [[Carbon dating]], [[Dendrochronology]], [[Oxygen isotope ratio cycle|isotope ratios]] on a number of gases, studies of insects and molluscs, and others. While often doubting the utility of the modified Bytt-Sernander, they seem to confirm and expand it all the more.

==Notes on the sequence table==
At present nine main pollen zones, I-IX, are defined, based on the work of [[Johannes Iversen|J. Iversen]], published in 1954. These are matched to period names called "biostratigraphic divisions" in the table, which were defined for Denmark by Iverson based on layers in the peat bogs. They represent climatic and biological zones in the peat. 

Others have used these names in different senses, such as the 1974 chronozones of J. Mangerud. The sequences in Germany and Sweden are not exactly the same as those in Denmark, inviting scientists there to use the names still differently or make other definitions. Moreover, the names are apt to be used interchangeably for glacials, interglacials, stadial, interstadials, or oscillations, leading some scientists to deplore the lack of system.

The system of the table below covers from around 13,000 BC to the modern day. Dates, given in years BC, are best viewed as being based on uncalibrated C-14 dates, which, when calibrated, would result in much earlier BC dates. For example, an Older Dryas start date of 10,000 BC translates roughly into an uncalibrated BP date of 12,000. Calibrated, that becomes 14,000 BP, 12,000 BC. To obtain quick, on-line calibrations, you may use [http://www.calpal-online.de/index.html CalPal].

The dates in the table correspond relatively well to more modern dates for the earlier periods. Larger discrepancies begin at the end of the Boreal. More, and more modern, details on the dating of the periods are given under the article for each one.

The archaeological periods listed only apply to north Europe, and do so approximately. For example, there is no uniform chronozone, "the Bronze Age", which would apply globally or even be of the same dates between north and south Europe.

The geological stages listed are only defined for the British Isles. Scientists use different names for north Europe, south Europe and other regions. However, they are cross-correlated in the articles for the ones listed.

In contrast to glacial periods, these pollen zones are being used to apply globally, with but few exceptions. It is acceptable, for example, to refer to the "Younger Dryas" of [[Antarctica]], which has no pollen of its own. A few scientists disapprove of such uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">'''''Profanum''''' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "profane".  The distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] was considered by [[Émile Durkheim]] to be central to the social reality of human [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile (1976). ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', p. 37. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin (originally published 1915, English translation 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred/profane==

The profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the ''[[Lebenswelt]]'' or lifeworld.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the sacred, or ''sacrum'' in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or [[numinous]] can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an [[amulet]] for example may be sacred yet little respected.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

[[Rites of passage]] represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.

==Profane progress==
Modernization and the [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]] project have led to a [[secularisation]] of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredric Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter reaction==

The advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. [[Modernism]] set out to bring [[Mythology|myth]] and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 180-2&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Wallace Stevens]] speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fundamentalism]] – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco. ''Turning Back the Clock'' (2007) pp. 218–20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology]] too has set out to protect the [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] of the individual self from profane intrusion,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''The Psychology of Human Destiny'' (1974) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; establishing ritual places for inward work&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (1991) p. 194 and p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, p. 77-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
[[Seamus Heaney]] considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.&lt;ref&gt;Denis O'Driscoll, ''Stepping Stones'' (2008) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], a '''prosthesis''' (plural: prostheses; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''prosthesis'', "addition, application, attachment"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pro/sqesis|πρόσθεσις|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or congenital conditions. Prosthetics are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part.&lt;ref name="madehow.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html|title=How artificial limb is made - material, manufacture, making, used, parts, components, structure, procedure|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosthetic [[amputation|amputee]] rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a prosthetist and an inter-disciplinary team of health care professionals including psychiatrists, surgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Prosthetics are commonly created with CAD (Computer-Aided Design), a software interface that helps creators visualize the creation in a 3D form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/alp/chap04-01.asp|title=4: Prosthetic Management: Overview, Methods, and Materials {{!}} O&amp;P Virtual Library|website=www.oandplibrary.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they can also be designed by hand.

==Types==
A person's prosthesis should be designed and assembled according to the person's appearance and functional needs. For instance, a person may need a transradial prosthesis, but need to choose between an aesthetic functional device, a myoelectric device, a body-powered device, or an activity specific device. The person's future goals and economical capabilities may help them choose between one or more devices.

[[Craniofacial prosthesis|Craniofacial prostheses]] include intra-oral and extra-oral prostheses. Extra-oral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial, auricular (ear), nasal, [[Orbital prosthesis|orbital]] and [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular]]. Intra-oral prostheses include [[dental prostheses]] such as [[dentures]], [[palatal obturator|obturators]], and [[dental implant]]s.

Prostheses of the neck include [[larynx]] [[Electrolarynx|substitutes]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and upper [[esophagus|esophageal]] replacements,

[[Somato prosthesis|Somato prostheses]] of the torso include [[breast prostheses]] which may be either single or bilateral, full breast devices or [[Nipple prosthesis|nipple prostheses]].

[[Penile prosthesis|Penile prostheses]] are used to treat erectile dysfunction.

===Limb prostheses===
[[File:A formation of Marines, firemen and policemen running across Manhattan in 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with bilateral prosthetic legs leads a formation run]]
[[Limb (anatomy)|Limb]] prostheses include both upper- and lower-extremity prostheses.

'''Upper-extremity prostheses''' are used at varying levels of amputation: forequarter, shoulder disarticulation, transhumeral prosthesis, elbow disarticulation, transradial prosthesis, wrist disarticulation, full hand, partial hand, finger, partial finger. A transradial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow.

Upper limb prostheses can be categorized in three main categories: Passive devices, Body Powered devices, Externally Powered (myoelectric) devices. Passive devices can either be passive hands, mainly used for cosmetic purpose, or passive tools, mainly used for specific activities (e.g. leisure or vocational). An extensive overview and classification of passive devices can be found in a literature review by Maat ''et.al.''&lt;ref name="Review Passive Prosthetic Hands"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maat|first1=Bartjan|last2=Smit|first2=Gerwin|last3=Plettenburg|first3=Dick|last4=Breedveld|first4=Paul|title=Passive prosthetic hands and tools: A literature review|journal=Prosthetics and Orthotics International|date=1 March 2017|doi=10.1177/0309364617691622|pmid=28190380|pmc=5810914|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=66–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A passive device can be static, meaning the device has no movable parts, or it can be adjustable, meaning its configuration can be adjusted (e.g. adjustable hand opening). Despite the absence of active grasping, passive devices are very useful in bimanual tasks that require fixation or support of an object, or for gesticulation in social interaction. According to scientific data a third of the upper limb amputees worldwide use a passive prosthetic hand.&lt;ref name="Review Passive Prosthetic Hands" /&gt; Body Powered or cable operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm. The third category of prosthetic devices available are [[myoelectric]] arms. These work by sensing, via [[electrode]]s, when the muscles in the [[Arm|upper arm]] move, causing an artificial hand to open or close. In the prosthetics industry, a trans-radial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a "BE" or below elbow prosthesis.

'''Lower-extremity prostheses''' provide replacements at varying levels of amputation. These include hip disarticulation, transfemoral prosthesis, knee disarticulation, transtibial prosthesis, Syme's amputation, foot, partial foot, and toe. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency).

A transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee. Transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement. In general, a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80% more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; This is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee. In newer and more improved designs, hydraulics, carbon fiber, mechanical linkages, motors, computer microprocessors, and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user. In the prosthetics industry a trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

A transtibial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee. A transtibial amputee is usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation, due in large part to retaining the knee, which allows for easier movement.  Lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. In the prosthetics industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis.

Physical therapists are trained to teach a person to walk with a leg prosthesis. To do so, the physical therapist may provide verbal instructions and may also help guide the person using touch, or tactile cues. This may be done in a clinic or home. There is some research suggesting that such training in the home may be more successful if the treatment includes the use of a treadmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Highsmith|first=M.

In the United Kingdom, 75% of lower limb amputations are performed due to inadequate [[Circulatory system|circulation]] (dysvascularity).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cumming|first=Jane|last2=Barr|first2=Steve|last3=Howe|first3=Tracey E.|date=2015-01-25|title=Prosthetic rehabilitation for older dysvascular people following a unilateral transfemoral amputation|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD005260|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005260.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25618482|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350430|date = December 2018}} This condition is often associated with many other medical conditions ([[Comorbidity|co-morbidities]]) including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] that may make it a challenge to recover and use a prosthetic limb to regain mobility and independence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For people who have inadequate circulation and have lost a lower limb, there is insufficient evidence due to a lack of research, to inform them regarding their choice of prosthetic rehabilitation approaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lower extremity prostheses are often categorized by the level of amputation or after the name of a surgeon:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atlas of limb prosthetics : surgical, prosthetic, and rehabilitation principles|last=|first=|date=2002|publisher=Mosby Year Book|others=Bowker, John H., Michael, John W., American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.|isbn=978-0892032754|edition= 2nd|location=St. Louis|pages=389, 413, 429, 479, 501, 535, 885|oclc=54693136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Partial foot amputations|last=Bengt.|first=Söderberg|date=2001|publisher=Centre for Partial Foot Amputees|isbn=978-9163107566|edition= 2nd|location=Sweden|pages=21|oclc=152577368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosthetics have been mentioned throughout history. The earliest recorded mention is the warrior queen [[Vishpala]] in the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses |author=Vanderwerker, Earl E., Jr.|year= 1976|volume=15|issue=5|journal=ICIB |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Egyptians were early pioneers of the idea, as shown by the wooden toe found on a body from the [[New Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1705.htm |title=No. 1705: A 3000-Year-Old Toe |publisher=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman bronze [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]] have also been found, but their use could have been more aesthetic than medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0517|title=Bronze Single Crown-like Prosthetic Restorations of Teeth from the Late Roman Period|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=27|issue=7|pages=641–644|year=2000|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Amnon|last2=Dvorachek|first2=Michael|last3=Rotstein|first3=Ilan}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An early mention of a prosthetic comes from the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who tells the story of [[Hegesistratus]], a Greek [[Divination|diviner]] who cut off his own foot to escape his [[Sparta]]n captors and replaced it with a wooden one.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories''. 9.37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood and metal hands ===
[[Pliny the Elder]] also recorded the tale of a Roman general, [[Marcus Sergius]], whose right hand was cut off while campaigning and had an [[Iron hand (prosthesis)|iron hand]] made to hold his shield so that he could return to battle. A famous and quite refined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karlofgermany.com/Goetz.htm |title=The Iron Hand of the Goetz von Berlichingen |publisher=Karlofgermany.com |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; historical prosthetic arm was that of [[Götz von Berlichingen]], made at the beginning of the 16th century.  The first confirmed use of a prosthetic device, however, is from 950–710 BC. In 2000, research pathologists discovered a mummy from this period buried in the Egyptian necropolis near ancient Thebes that possessed an artificial big toe.  This toe, consisting of wood and leather, exhibited evidence of use.  When reproduced by bio-mechanical engineers in 2011, researchers discovered that this ancient prosthetic enabled its wearer to walk both barefoot and in Egyptian style sandals.  Previously, the earliest discovered prosthetic was an artificial [[Roman Capua Leg|leg from Capua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Finch |first1= Jacqueline |title= The Art of Medicine: The Ancient Origins of Prosthetic Medicine |journal= The Lancet |date= February 2011 |volume=377 |issue=9765 |pages= 348–349 |doi= 10.1016/s0140-6736(11)60190-6 |pmid=21341402|url=http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673611601906/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[François de la Noue]] is also reported to have had an iron hand, as is, in the 17th Century, [[Cavalier de la Salle|René-Robert Cavalier de la Salle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1887|publisher=S.

During the Middle Ages, prosthetic remained quite basic in form.

During the Renaissance, prosthetics developed with the use of iron, steel, copper, and wood. Functional prosthetics began to make an appearance in the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unyq.com/the-history-of-prosthetics/|title=The History of Prosthetics|date=2015-09-21|work=UNYQ|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology progress before the 20th century ===
An Italian surgeon recorded the existence of an amputee who had an arm that allowed him to remove his hat, open his purse, and sign his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2660173|year=1989|author1=Romm|first1=S|title=Arms by design: From antiquity to the Renaissance|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=84|issue=1|pages=158–63|doi=10.1097/00006534-198907000-00029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvement in amputation surgery and prosthetic design came at the hands of [[Ambroise Paré]]. Among his inventions was an above-knee device that was a kneeling [[peg leg]] and foot prosthesis with a fixed position, adjustable harness, and knee lock control. The functionality of his advancements showed how future prosthetics could develop.

Other major improvements before the modern era:
* [[Pieter Verduyn]]&amp;nbsp;– First non-locking below-knee (BK) prosthesis.
* [[James Potts]]&amp;nbsp;– Prosthesis made of a wooden shank and socket, a steel knee joint and an articulated foot that was controlled by catgut tendons from the knee to the ankle. Came to be known as “Anglesey Leg” or “Selpho Leg”.
* Sir [[James Syme]]&amp;nbsp;– A new method of ankle amputation that did not involve amputating at the thigh.
* [[Benjamin Palmer]]&amp;nbsp;– Improved upon the Selpho leg. Added an anterior spring and concealed tendons to simulate natural-looking movement.
* [[Dubois Parmlee]]&amp;nbsp;– Created prosthetic with a suction socket, polycentric knee, and multi-articulated foot.
* [[Marcel Desoutter]] &amp; [[Charles Desoutter]]&amp;nbsp;– First aluminium prosthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/inmotion/nov_dec_07/history_prosthetics.html | work=inMotion: A Brief History of Prosthetics | title=A Brief History of Prosthetics| date=November–December 2007| accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henry Heather Bigg, and his son Henry Robert Heather Bigg, won the Queen's command to provide "surgical appliances" to wounded soldiers after Crimea War.

London&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) began to advocate better research and development of prosthetics. Through government funding, a research and development program was developed within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Veterans Administration.

===Lower extremity modern history===
Socket technology for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution during the 1980s when John Sabolich C.P.O., invented the Contoured Adducted Trochanteric-Controlled Alignment Method (CATCAM) socket, later to evolve into the Sabolich Socket. He followed the direction of Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended plug socket, created from wood.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf | title=Normal Shape-Normal Alignment (NSNA) Above-Knee Prosthesis | author=Long, Ivan A. | journal=Clin Prosthet Orthot | year=1985 | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.&lt;ref name="Gottschalk-Kourosh-Stills"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does Socket Configuration Influence the Position of the Femur in Above-Knee Amputation? |author1=Gottschalk, Frank A. |author2=Kourosh, Sohrab |author3=Stills, Melvin |author4=McClellan, Bruce |author5=Roberts, Jim | journal=Journal of Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics | year=1989 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=94–102 | doi=10.1097/00008526-198910000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was the first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A. Blatchford &amp; Sons, Ltd., of Great Britain, in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blatchford.co.uk/about/company-history/ “Blatchford Company History”], Blatchford Group.&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998. The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed. Cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated above-knee prosthesis will be about $1 million in 45 years, given only annual cost of living adjustments.&lt;ref name=PikeAlvin/&gt;

==Patient procedure==
A prosthesis is a functional replacement for an amputated or congenitally malformed or missing limb. Prosthetists are responsible for the prescription, design and management of a prosthetic device.

In most cases, the prosthetist begins by taking a plaster cast of the patient's affected limb. Lightweight, high-strength thermoplastics are custom-formed to this model of the patient. Cutting-edge materials such as carbon fiber, titanium and Kevlar provide strength and durability while making the new prosthesis lighter. More sophisticated prostheses are equipped with advanced electronics, providing additional stability and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progoandp.com/services/prosthetics/ |title=Custom Prosthetics, Artificial Limbs LI, NY &amp;#124; Progressive O&amp;P |publisher=Progoandp.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current technology and manufacturing==
[[File:WorkNC-Knee prosthesis.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Knee prosthesis manufactured using [[WorkNC]] [[Computer Aided Manufacturing]] software]]
Over the years, there have been advancements in artificial limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as [[carbon fiber]], have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This is especially important for trans-femoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to trans-radial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html |title=How artificial limb is made&amp;nbsp;– Background, Raw materials, The manufacturing process of artificial limb, Physical therapy, Quality control |publisher=Madehow.com |date=1988-04-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journal.pone.0019508.g004 prosthetic finger.png|left|thumb|Manufacturing a prosthetic finger]]
In addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. [[CAD/CAM|Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing]] are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sapphire"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mamalis |first1=AG |last2=Ramsden |first2=JJ |last3=Grabchenko |first3=AI |last4=Lytvynov |first4=LA |last5=Filipenko |first5=VA |last6=Lavrynenko |first6=SN |title=A novel concept for the manufacture of individual sapphire-metallic hip joint endoprostheses |journal=Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=113–117 |doi=10.4024/30601.jbpc.06.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern artificial limbs are attached to the residual limb (stump) of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by [[suction]]. The residual limb either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other residual limb shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the residual limb (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the residual limb. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the residual limb or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the residual limb, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser-guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.

One problem with the residual limb and socket attachment is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the residual limb and socket or liner, and increase pockets between residual limb skin and socket or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Over time, this can lead to breakdown of the skin.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/leg/default.htm |title=Getting an artificial leg up&amp;nbsp;– Cathy Johnson |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps:&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;
# Measurement of the residual limb
# Measurement of the body to determine the size required for the artificial limb
# Fitting of a silicone liner
# Creation of a model of the liner worn over the residual limb
# Formation of [[thermoplastic]] sheet around the model&amp;nbsp;– This is then used to test the fit of the prosthetic
# Formation of permanent socket
# Formation of plastic parts of the artificial limb&amp;nbsp;– Different methods are used, including [[vacuum forming]] and [[injection molding]]
# Creation of metal parts of the artificial limb using [[die casting]]
# Assembly of entire limb

===Body-powered arms===

Current technology allows body powered arms to weigh around one-half to one-third of what a myoelectric arm does.

====Sockets====
Current body-powered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or "interfaces" can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self-suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid-range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may require the use of a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.

====Wrists====
Wrist units are either screw-on connectors featuring the UNF 1/2-20 thread (USA) or quick-release connector, of which there are different models.

====Voluntary opening and voluntary closing====
Two types of body-powered systems exist, voluntary opening "pull to open" and voluntary closing "pull to close". Virtually all "split hook" prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system.

More modern "prehensors" called GRIPS utilize voluntary closing systems. The differences are significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force, while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force.

Voluntary closing users can generate prehension forces equivalent to the normal hand, upwards to or exceeding one hundred pounds. Voluntary closing GRIPS require constant tension to grip, like a human hand, and in that property, they do come closer to matching human hand performance. Voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below 20 pounds.

====Feedback====
An additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to "feel" what is being held. Voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm. No gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held. Voluntary closing systems provide directly [[Proportional Myoelectric Control|proportional control]] and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying.

A recent study showed that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information could be provided to an amputee. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 24500407 "&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raspopovic S1, Capogrosso M, Petrini FM| title = Restoring natural sensory feedback in real-time bidirectional hand prostheses. | journal = Sci.

Researchers from École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne in Switzerland and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Italy, implanted the electrodes into the amputee's arm in February 2013. The study, published Wednesday{{When|date=May 2015}} in ''Science Translational Medicine'', details the first time sensory feedback has been restored allowing an amputee to control an artificial limb in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/05/bionic-hand-amputee-feels/5229665/ "With a new prosthetic, researchers have managed to restore the sense of touch for a Denmark man who lost his left hand nine years ago."], ''USA Today'', February 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; With wires linked to nerves in his upper arm, the Danish patient was able to handle objects and instantly receive a sense of touch through the special artificial hand that was created by Silvestro Micera and researchers both in Switzerland and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/artificial-hand-offering/986332.html "Artificial hand offering immediate touch response a success"], ''Channelnewsasia'', February 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal devices====
Terminal devices contain a range of hooks, prehensors, hands or other devices.

=====Hooks=====
Voluntary opening split hook systems are simple, convenient, light, robust, versatile and relatively affordable.

A hook does not match a normal human hand for appearance or overall versatility, but its material tolerances can exceed and surpass the normal human hand for mechanical stress (one can even use a hook to slice open boxes or as a hammer whereas the same is not possible with a normal hand), for thermal stability (one can use a hook to grip items from boiling water, to turn meat on a grill, to hold a match until it has burned down completely) and for chemical hazards (as a metal hook withstands acids or lye, and does not react to solvents like a prosthetic glove or human skin).

=====Hands=====
[[File:Myoelectric prosthetic arm.jpg|right|thumb|Actor [[Owen Wilson]] gripping the myoelectric prosthetic arm of a United States Marine]]

Prosthetic hands are available in both voluntary opening and voluntary closing versions and because of their more complex mechanics and cosmetic glove covering require a relatively large activation force, which, depending on the type of harness used, may be uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Commercial providers and materials====
Hosmer and [[Otto Bock]] are major commercial hook providers. Mechanical hands are sold by Hosmer and Otto Bock as well; the Becker Hand is still manufactured by the Becker family. Prosthetic hands may be fitted with standard stock or custom-made cosmetic looking silicone gloves. But regular work gloves may be worn as well. Other terminal devices include the V2P Prehensor, a versatile robust gripper that allows customers to modify aspects of it, Texas Assist Devices (with a whole assortment of tools) and TRS that offers a range of terminal devices for sports. Cable harnesses can be built using aircraft steel cables, ball hinges, and self-lubricating cable sheaths. Some prosthetics have been designed specifically for use in salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Onken|first1=Sarah|title=Dive In|url=http://www.cityviewnc.com/2014/01/06/20010/dive-in|website=cityviewnc.com|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower-extremity prosthetics===
[[File:AustralianParalympianOfTheYear 468.JPG|thumb|right|A prosthetic leg worn by [[Ellie Cole]]]]
Lower-extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. Concerning all ages Ephraim et al. (2003) found a worldwide estimate of all-cause lower-extremity amputations of 2.0–5.9 per 10,000 inhabitants. For birth prevalence rates of congenital limb deficiency they found an estimate between 3.5–7.1 cases per 10,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12736892|year=2003|author1=Ephraim|first1=P. L.|title=Epidemiology of limb loss and congenital limb deficiency: A review of the literature|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=84|issue=5|pages=747–61|last2=Dillingham|first2=T. R.|last3=Sector|first3=M|last4=Pezzin|first4=L. E.|last5=MacKenzie|first5=E. J.|doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(02)04932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency), and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency). In the prosthetic industry, a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a "BK" or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an "AK" or above the knee prosthesis.

Other, less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following:
# Hip disarticulations&amp;nbsp;– This usually refers to when an amputee or congenitally challenged patient has either an amputation or anomaly at or in close proximity to the hip joint.
# Knee disarticulations&amp;nbsp;– This usually refers to an amputation through the knee disarticulating the femur from the tibia.
# Symes&amp;nbsp;– This is an ankle disarticulation while preserving the heel pad.

====Socket====
The socket serves as an interface between the residuum and the prosthesis, ideally allowing comfortable weight-bearing, movement control and proprioception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11392649|year=2001|author1=Mak|first1=A. F.|title=State-of-the-art research in lower-limb prosthetic biomechanics-socket interface: A review|journal=Journal of rehabilitation research and development|volume=38|issue=2|pages=161–74|last2=Zhang|first2=M|last3=Boone|first3=D. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socket issues, such as discomfort and skin breakdown, are rated among the most important issues faced by lower-limb amputees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legro|first=M.

====Shank and connectors====
This part creates distance and support between the knee-joint and the foot (in case of an upper-leg prosthesis) or between the socket and the foot. The type of connectors that are used between the shank and the knee/foot determines whether the prosthesis is modular or not. Modular means that the angle and the displacement of the foot in respect to the socket can be changed after fitting. In developing countries prosthesis mostly are non-modular, in order to reduce cost. When considering children modularity of angle and height is important because of their average growth of 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Foot====
Providing contact to the ground, the foot provides shock absorption and stability during stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00008526-200510001-00007|title=Perspectives on How and Why Feet are Prescribed|journal=JPO Journal of Prosthetics and Orthotics|volume=17|pages=S18|year=2005|last1=Stark|first1=Gerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally it influences gait biomechanics by its shape and stiffness. This is because the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP) and the angle of the ground reaction forces is determined by the shape and stiffness of the foot and needs to match the subject's build in order to produce a normal gait pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0966-6362(93)90038-3|title=Trajectory of the body COG and COP during initiation and termination of gait|journal=Gait &amp; Posture|volume=1|pages=9–22|year=1993|last1=Jian|first1=Yuancheng|last2=Winter|first2=DA|last3=Ishac|first3=MG|last4=Gilchrist|first4=L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrysek (2010) found 16 different types of feet, with greatly varying results concerning durability and biomechanics.

====Knee joint====
In case of a trans-femoral amputation, there also is a need for a complex connector providing articulation, allowing flexion during swing-phase but not during stance.

=====Microprocessor control=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CLegProfile.jpg|frame|right|Two different models of microprocessor controlled knees (C-leg)]] --&gt;
To mimic the knee's functionality during gait, microprocessor-controlled knee joints have been developed that control the flexion of the knee. Some examples are [[Otto Bock]]’s C-leg, introduced in 1997, Ossur's Rheo Knee, released in 2005, the Power Knee by [[Ossur]], introduced in 2006, the Plié Knee from Freedom Innovations and DAW Industries’ Self Learning Knee (SLK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daw-usa.com/Pages/SLK3.html "The SLK, The Self-Learning Knee"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081600/http://www.daw-usa.com/Pages/SLK3.html# |date=2012-04-25 }}, DAW Industries. Retrieved 16 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was originally developed by Kelly James, a Canadian engineer, at the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/20/health/menshealth/20marrbox.html |title = Titanium and Sensors Replace Ahab's Peg Leg |accessdate=2008-10-30 |work= The New York Times |date= 2005-06-20 | first=Michel | last=Marriott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microprocessor is used to interpret and analyze signals from knee-angle sensors and moment sensors. The microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee. Most microprocessor controlled knee-joints are powered by a battery housed inside the prosthesis.

The sensory signals computed by the microprocessor are used to control the resistance generated by [[hydraulic cylinders]] in the knee-joint. Small valves control the amount of [[hydraulic fluid]] that can pass into and out of the cylinder, thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee.&lt;ref name=PikeAlvin&gt;Pike, Alvin (May/June 1999). "The New High Tech Prostheses". InMotion Magazine 9 (3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of a microprocessor-controlled prosthesis is a closer approximation to an amputee's natural gait. Some allow amputees to walk near walking speed or run. Variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor, which adjusts to these changes accordingly. It also enables the amputees to walk downstairs with a step-over-step approach, rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees.&lt;ref name=MartinCraigW&gt;Martin, Craig W. (November 2003) [http://www.ibrarian.net/navon/paper/Evidence_Based_Practice_Group__EBPG_.pdf?paperid=2575568 "Otto Bock C-leg: A review of its effectiveness"]. WCB Evidence Based Group&lt;/ref&gt; There is some research suggesting that people with microprocessor-controlled prostheses report greater satisfaction and improvement in functionality, residual limb health, and safety.&lt;ref name="Kannenberg 2014 1469–1496"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kannenberg|first=Andreas|last2=Zacharias|first2=Britta|last3=Pröbsting|first3=Eva|date=2014|title=Benefits of microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees to limited community ambulators: systematic review|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|volume=51|issue=10|pages=1469–1496|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2014.05.0118|issn=1938-1352|pmid=25856664}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be able to perform everyday activities at greater speeds, even while multitasking, and reduce their risk of falls.&lt;ref name="Kannenberg 2014 1469–1496"/&gt;

However, some have some significant drawbacks that impair its use. They can be susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Myoelectric===
A '''myoelectric prosthesis''' uses the electrical tension generated every time a muscle contracts, as information. This tension can be captured from voluntarily contracted muscles by electrodes applied on the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuromuscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist, elbow or foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amputees control bionic legs with their thoughts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/20/us-iceland-mind-controlled-limb-idUSKBN0O51EQ20150520|publisher=Reuters|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of the prosthesis. There is no clear evidence concluding that myoelectric upper extremity prostheses function better than body-powered prostheses.&lt;ref name=Carey2015 /&gt; Advantages to using a myoelectric upper extremity prosthesis include the potential for improvement in cosmetic appeal (this type of prosthesis may have a more natural look), may be better for light everyday activities, and may be beneficial for people experiencing [[phantom limb]] pain.&lt;ref name=Carey2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Stephanie L.|last2=Lura|first2=Derek J.|last3=Highsmith|first3=M.

Researchers at the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]] announced in September 2013 that they have developed a robotic leg that translates neural impulses from the user's thigh muscles into movement, which is the first prosthetic leg to do so. It is currently in testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2013/09/robotic-leg-emg.html |title=Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago First to Develop Thought Controlled Robotic Leg |publisher=Medgadget.com |date=September 2013 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robotic prostheses===

Robots can be used to generate objective measures of patient's impairment and therapy outcome, assist in diagnosis, customize therapies based on patient's motor abilities, and assure compliance with treatment regimens and maintain patient's records. It is shown in many studies that there is a significant improvement in upper limb motor function after stroke using robotics for upper limb rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinkensmeyer David J | year = 2009 | title = Robotic Assistance For Upper Extremity Training After Stroke | journal = Studies in Health Technology and Informatics | volume = 145 | issue =  | pages = 25–39 | pmid = 19592784 | url = http://computational.eu/emerging//book9/chapter_2.pdf | access-date = 2016-12-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228195545/http://computational.eu/emerging//book9/chapter_2.pdf# | archive-date = 2016-12-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work, it must have several components to integrate it into the body's function: [[Biosensors]] detect signals from the user's nervous or muscular systems. It then relays this information to a [[Controller (computing)|controller]] located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator, e.g., position or force, and sends it to the controller. Examples include surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. One type of these biosensors are employed in [[myoelectric prosthesis|myoelectric prostheses]].

A device known as the [[Controller (computing)|controller]] is connected to the user's nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.

An [[actuator]] mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a technique in which [[motor nerve]]s, which previously controlled [[muscle]]s on an amputated limb, are [[surgery|surgically]] rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large, intact muscle, such as the [[pectoralis major]]. As a result, when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of his missing hand, a small area of muscle on his chest will contract instead. By placing sensors over the reinnervated muscle, these contractions can be made to control the movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kuiken TA, Miller LA, Lipschutz RD, Lock BA, Stubblefield K, Marasco PD, Zhou P, Dumanian GA |title=Targeted reinnervation for enhanced prosthetic arm function in a woman with a proximal amputation: a case study |journal=Lancet |date= February 3, 2007 |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=371–80 |pmid=17276777 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22730/ |title=Blogs: TR Editors' blog: Patients Test an Advanced Prosthetic Arm |work=Technology Review |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR). This procedure is similar to TMR, except that [[sensory nerve]]s are surgically rerouted to [[skin]] on the chest, rather than motor nerves rerouted to muscle. Recently, robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from [[Human brain|the human brain]] and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb. [[DARPA]], the Pentagon's research division, is working to make even more advancements in this area. Their desire is to create an artificial limb that ties directly into the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/sn07-43.htm |title=Defense Sciences Office |publisher=Darpa.mil |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080528/http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/sn07-43.htm# |archive-date=2009-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robotic arms====
Advancements in the processors used in myoelectric arms have allowed developers to make gains in fine-tuned control of the prosthetic. The [[Boston Digital Arm]] is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the [[i-Limb hand]], invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by [[David Gow]] has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power, and key grip modes.

Another neural prosthetic is [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] [[Proto 1]]. Besides the Proto 1, the university also finished the [[Proto 2]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ric.org/aboutus/mediacenter/press/2007/o501.aspx |title=Proto 1 and Proto 2 |publisher=Ric.org |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2010-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215917/http://www.ric.org/aboutus/mediacenter/press/2007/o501.aspx# |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2013, Max Ortiz Catalan and Rickard Brånemark of the Chalmers University of Technology, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden, succeeded in making the first robotic arm which is mind-controlled and can be permanently attached to the body (using [[osseointegration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130222075730.htm |title=World premiere of muscle and nerve controlled arm prosthesis |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=February 2013 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/thought-controlled-prosthetic-arm/25216/ |title=Mind-controlled permanently-attached prosthetic arm could revolutionize prosthetics |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2016-12-28 |author=Williams, Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Jason |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/sectors/medical-and-healthcare/news/trials-imminent-for-implantable-thought-controlled-robotic-arm/1014779.article |title=Trials imminent for implantable thought-controlled robotic arm |publisher=Theengineer.co.uk |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An approach that is very useful is called arm rotation which is common for unilateral amputees which is an amputation that affects only one side of the body; and also essential for bilateral amputees, a person who is missing or has had amputated either both arms or legs, to carry out activities of daily living. This involves inserting a small permanent magnet into the distal end of the residual bone of subjects with upper limb amputations. When a subject rotates the residual arm, the magnet will rotate with the residual bone, causing a change in magnetic field distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li, Guanglin |author2=Kuiken, Todd A | year = 2008 | title = Modeling of Prosthetic Limb Rotation Control by Sensing Rotation of Residual Arm Bone | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 2134–2142 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2008.923914| pmc=3038244 | pmid=18713682}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG (electroencephalogram) signals, detected using small flat metal discs attached to the scalp, essentially decoding human brain activity used for physical movement, is used to control the robotic limbs.

====Robotic legs====
The research of Robotic legs has made some advancement over time, allowing exact movement and control. A company in Switzerland called Ossur, has created a robotic leg that moves through algorithms and sensors that automatically adjust the angle of the foot during different points in its wearer's stride. Also there are brain-controlled bionic legs that allow an individual to move his limbs with a wireless transmitter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really|title=Brain-Controlled Bionic Legs Are Finally Here|work=Popular Science|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Prosthesis design=====
The main goal of a robotic prosthesis is to provide active actuation during gait to improve the biomechanics of gait, including, among other things, stability, symmetry, or energy expenditure for amputees. There are several powered prosthetic legs currently on the market, including fully powered legs, in which actuators directly drive the joints, and semi-active legs, which use small amounts of energy and a small actuator to change the mechanical properties of the leg but do not inject net positive energy into gait.  Specific examples include The emPOWER from BionX, the Proprio Foot from Ossur, and the Elan Foot from Endolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionxmed.com/|title=Home - BionX Medical Technologies|website=www.bionxmed.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ossur.com/prosthetic-solutions/products/dynamic-solutions/proprio-foot|title=PROPRIO FOOT|last=Össur|website=www.ossur.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.endolite.com/products/elan|title=Elan - Carbon, Feet, Hydraulic - Endolite USA - Lower Limb Prosthetics|work=Endolite USA - Lower Limb Prosthetics|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various research groups have also experimented with robotic legs over the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Windrich|first=Michael|last2=Grimmer|first2=Martin|last3=Christ|first3=Oliver|last4=Rinderknecht|first4=Stephan|last5=Beckerle|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-19|title=Active lower limb prosthetics: a systematic review of design issues and solutions|journal=BioMedical Engineering OnLine|volume=15|issue=3|pages=140|doi=10.1186/s12938-016-0284-9|pmid=28105948|pmc=5249019|issn=1475-925X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central issues being researched include designing the behavior of the device during stance and swing phases, recognizing the current ambulation task, and various mechanical design problems such as robustness, weight, battery-life/efficiency, and noise-level.

==Attachment to the body==
Most prostheses can be attached to the exterior of the body, in a non-permanent way. Some others however can be attached in a permanent way. One such example are exoprostheses (see below).

===Direct bone attachment and osseointegration===
{{Main|Osseointegration}}
[[Osseointegration]] is a method of attaching the artificial limb to the body. This method is also sometimes referred to as [[exoprosthesis]] (attaching an artificial limb to the bone), or endo-exoprosthesis.

The stump and socket method can cause significant pain in the amputee, which is why the direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump. After several months the [[osseointegration|bone attaches itself]] to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following:
* Better muscle control of the prosthetic.
* The ability to wear the prosthetic for an extended period of time; with the stump and socket method this is not possible.
* The ability for transfemoral amputees to drive a car.
The main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb, such as those experienced during jogging, because of the potential for the bone to break.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

==Cosmesis==
Cosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements. With advances in modern technology, [[cosmesis]], the creation of lifelike limbs made from [[silicone]] or [[PVC]] has been made possible. Such prosthetics, including artificial hands, can now be designed to simulate the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos.
Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of U.S. dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come premade in a variety of sizes, although they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.

==Cognition==
{{Main|Neuroprosthetics}}

Unlike neuromotor prostheses, neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as [[executive function]], [[attention]], language, and memory. No neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive brain-computer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[autism]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Serruya MD, Kahana MJ 2008 149"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= Behav Brain Res |year=2008 |title= Techniques and devices to restore cognition |vauthors=Serruya MD, Kahana MJ |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.04.007 |pmid=18539345 |volume= 192 |issue= 2|pages= 149–65|pmc= 3051349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recent field of [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15764275 Assistive Technology for Cognition] concerns the development of technologies to augment human cognition.  Scheduling devices such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20090413224808/http://www.neuropage.nhs.uk/default.asp?id= Neuropage] remind users with memory impairments when to perform certain activities, such as visiting the doctor.

In addition to the standard artificial limb for everyday use, many amputees or [[congenital]] patients have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities.

Within science fiction, and, more recently, within the [[scientific community]], there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function. The morality and desirability of such technologies are being debated by [[transhumanists]], other ethicists, and others in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/ht/enhancement/main |title=Enhancements, Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics |publisher=Practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228205218/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/ht/enhancement/main# |archive-date=2016-12-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010052 |pmid=15630464 |title=Is It Ethical to Use Enhancement Technologies to Make Us Better than Well? |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=e52 |year=2004 |last1=Caplan |first1=Arthur |last2=Elliott |first2=Carl |pmc=539045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587810.001.0001 |title=Beyond Humanity? |year=2011 |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen E. |isbn=9780199587810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2012.01964.x|title=Beyond Humanity?

The first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the British scientist [[Kevin Warwick]]. In 2002, an implant was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The [[electrode array]], which contained around a hundred [[electrode]]s, was placed in the [[median nerve]]. The signals produced were detailed enough that a [[robot arm]] was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant.&lt;ref name="Warwick, K 1373"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warwick K, Gasson M, Hutt B, Goodhew I, Kyberd P, Andrews B, Teddy P, Shad A | year = 2003 | title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems | url = | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 10| pages = 1369–1373 | doi=10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369 | pmid=14568806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscar Pistorius===
In early 2008, [[Oscar Pistorius]], the "Blade Runner" of South Africa, was briefly ruled ineligible to compete in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] because his transtibial prosthesis limbs were said to give him an unfair advantage over runners who had ankles. One researcher found that his limbs used twenty-five percent less energy than those of an able-bodied runner moving at the same speed.  This ruling was overturned on appeal, with the appellate court stating that the overall set of advantages and disadvantages of Pistorius' limbs had not been considered.

Pistorius did not qualify for the South African team for the Olympics, but went on to sweep the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]], and has been ruled eligible to qualify for any future Olympics.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} He qualified for the 2011 World Championship in South Korea and reached the semifinal where he ended last timewise, he was 14th in the first round, his personal best at 400m would have given him 5th place in the finals. At the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, Pistorius became the first amputee runner to compete at an Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Klemko|title=Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/track/story/2012-08-10/4x400-relay-oscar-pistorius-south-afric/56946372/1|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69qCZG7ST?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/track/story/2012-08-10/4x400-relay-oscar-pistorius-south-afric/56946372/1|archivedate=11 August 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=10 August 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran in the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's 400 metres|400&amp;nbsp;metres race]] semifinals,&lt;ref name="BBC 20120804"&gt;{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400m at London 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18911479|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bill Chappell|title=Oscar Pistorius makes Olympic history in 400 meters, and moves on to semifinal|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/08/04/158126486/oscar-pistorius-makes-olympic-history-in-400-meters-and-moves-on-to-semifinal|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69fiw3sEg?url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/08/04/158126486/oscar-pistorius-makes-olympic-history-in-400-meters-and-moves-on-to-semifinal|archivedate=4 August 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=4 August 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Men's 400m&amp;nbsp;– semifinals|url=http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event/men-400m/phase=atm004200/index.html|accessdate=4 August 2012|work=london2012.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's 4 × 400 metres relay|4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;400&amp;nbsp;metres relay race]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Oscar Pistorius, South African 4×400m relay team finish 8th as Bahamas wins gold|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/oscar-pistorius-south-africa-relay-4x400-olympics_n_1765596.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69qCxjdgj?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/oscar-pistorius-south-africa-relay-4x400-olympics_n_1765596.html|archivedate=11 August 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012|first=Chris|last=Greenberg|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also competed in 5 events in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hawking, Pistorius open London's Paralympics: Wheelchair-bound physicist Stephen Hawking challenged athletes to 'look to the stars' as he helped open a record-setting Paralympics Games that will run for 11 days in near sold-out venues|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/hawking-pistorius-open-londons-paralympics-194425194.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJGcTrlp?url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/hawking-pistorius-open-londons-paralympics-194425194.html|archivedate=30 August 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Design considerations==
There are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis. Manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors.

===Performance===
Nonetheless, there are certain elements of socket and foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete, and these are the focus of today's high-tech prosthetics companies:
* Fit&amp;nbsp;– athletic/active amputees, or those with bony residua, may require a carefully detailed socket fit; less-active patients may be comfortable with a 'total contact' fit and gel liner
* Energy storage and return&amp;nbsp;– storage of energy acquired through ground contact and utilization of that stored energy for propulsion
* Energy absorption&amp;nbsp;– minimizing the effect of high impact on the musculoskeletal system
* Ground compliance&amp;nbsp;– stability independent of terrain type and angle
* Rotation&amp;nbsp;– ease of changing direction
* Weight&amp;nbsp;– maximizing comfort, balance and speed
* Suspension&amp;nbsp;– how the socket will join and fit to the limb

===Other===
The buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors:
* Cosmetics
* Cost
* Ease of use
* Size availability

==Cost and source freedom==

===High-cost===
In the USA a typical prosthetic limb costs anywhere between $15,000 and $90,000, depending on the type of limb desired by the patient.  With medical insurance, a patient will typically pay 10%–50% of the total cost of a prosthetic limb, while the insurance company will cover the rest of the cost.  The percent that the patient pays varies on the type of insurance plan, as well as the limb requested by the patient.&lt;ref name="Cost of a Prosthetic Limb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost of a Prosthetic Limb|url=http://health.costhelper.com/prosthetic-legs.html|website=Cost Helper Health|accessdate= 13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, much of Europe, Australia and New Zealand the entire cost of prosthetic limbs is met by state funding or statutory insurance. For example, in Australia prostheses are fully funded by state schemes in the case of amputation due to disease, and by workers compensation or traffic injury insurance in the case of most traumatic amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for your prosthesis.|url=http://www.limbs4life.org.au/funding/funding-for-your-prosthesis|website=Limbs4life|publisher=Limbs4life|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which is being rolled out nationally between 2017 and 2020 also pays for prostheses.

Transradial (below the elbow amputation) and transtibial prostheses (below the knee amputation) typically cost between US [[United States dollar|$]]6,000 and $8,000, while transfemoral (above the knee amputation) and transhumeral prosthetics (above the elbow amputation) cost approximately twice as much with a range of $10,000 to $15,000 and can sometimes reach costs of $35,000. The cost of an artificial limb often recurs, while a limb typically needs to be replaced every 3–4 years due to [[wear and tear]] of everyday use.  In addition, if the socket has fit issues, the socket must be replaced within several months from the onset of pain. If height is an issue, components such as pylons can be changed.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/07/05/cost_of_prosthetics_stirs_debate/ "Cost of Prosthetics Stirs Debate"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 5 July 2005. Retrieved 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does the patient need to pay for their multiple prosthetic limbs, but they also need to pay for physical and occupational therapy that come along with adapting to living with an artificial limb.  Unlike the reoccurring cost of the prosthetic limbs, the patient will typically only pay the $2000 to $5000 for therapy during the first year or two of living as an amputee.  Once the patient is strong and comfortable with their new limb, they will not be required to go to therapy anymore. Throughout one's life, it is projected that a typical amputee will go through $1.4 million worth of treatment, including surgeries, prosthetics, as well as therapies.&lt;ref name="Cost of a Prosthetic Limb"/&gt;

===Low-cost===
{{See also|3D printing}}
Low-cost above-knee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function. This function is often achieved with crude, non-articulating, unstable, or manually locking knee joints. A limited number of organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), create devices for developing countries. Their device which is manufactured by CR Equipments is a single-axis, manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf |title=ICRC: Trans-Femoral Prosthesis&amp;nbsp;– Manufacturing Guidelines |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Low cost prosthetic limbs.jpg|thumb|Low-cost above-knee prosthetic limbs: ICRC Knee (left) and LC Knee (right)]]

A plan for a low-cost artificial leg, designed by Sébastien Dubois, was featured at the 2007 International Design Exhibition and award show in Copenhagen, Denmark, where it won the [[Index: Award]]. It would be able to create an energy-return prosthetic leg for US [[United States dollar|$]]8.00, composed primarily of [[fiberglass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexaward.dk/2007/default.asp?id=706&amp;show=nomination&amp;nominationid=163&amp;playmovie=wmv INDEX:2007 INDEX: AWARD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202173652/http://www.indexaward.dk/2007/default.asp?id=706&amp;show=nomination&amp;nominationid=163&amp;playmovie=wmv |date=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one's residual limb to the ground.

The introduction of the [[Seattle Foot]] ([[Seattle Limb Systems]]) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an [[Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot]] (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.

Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.

With [[3D printing|3D printers]], it is possible to manufacture a single product without having to have metal [[Molding (process)|molds]], so the costs can be drastically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagata |first=Kazuaki |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/10/national/science-health/robot-arm-startup-taps-3-d-printers-in-quest-to-make-prosthetics-affordable/#.VeCJ9_btlBd |title=Robot arm startup taps 3-D printers in quest to make prosthetics affordable |publisher=Japantimes.co.jp |date=2015-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jaipur leg|Jaipur Foot]]'', an artificial limb from [[Jaipur]], [[India]], costs about US$40.

===Open-source robotic prothesis===
{{See also|Open-source hardware|Modular design|3D printing|Thingiverse}}
There is currently an [[Open-design movement|open-design]] Prosthetics forum known as the "[[Open Prosthetics Project]]".  The group employs collaborators and volunteers to advance Prosthetics technology while attempting to lower the costs of these necessary devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://OpenProsthetics.org |title=Open Prosthetics Website |publisher=Openprosthetics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open Bionics]] is a company that is developing open-source robotic prosthetic hands. It uses 3D printing to manufacture the devices and low-cost 3D scanners to fit them, with the aim of lowering the cost of fabricating custom prosthetics. A review study on a wide range of printed prosthetic hands, found that although 3D printing technology holds a promise for individualised prosthesis design, it is not necessarily cheaper when all costs are included. The same study also found that evidence on the functionality, durability and user acceptance of 3D printed hand prostheses is still lacking.&lt;ref name="Review 3D-printed hand prostheses"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kate|first1=Jelle ten|last2=Smit|first2=Gerwin|last3=Breedveld|first3=Paul|title=3D-printed upper limb prostheses: a review|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]|date=3 April 2017|volume=12|issue=3|pages=300–314|doi=10.1080/17483107.2016.1253117|pmid=28152642|issn=1748-3107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-cost prosthetics for children==
{{See also|open-source hardware|3D printing}}
In the USA an estimate was found of 32,500 children (&lt;21 years) that suffer from major paediatric amputation, with 5,525 new cases each year, of which 3,315 congenital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1946626|year=1991|author1=Krebs|first1=D.

A.|doi=10.1097/01241398-199205000-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr et al. (1998) investigated amputations caused by landmines for Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and Mozambique among children (&lt;14 years), showing estimates of respectively 4.7, 0.19, 1.11 and 0.67 per 1000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carr, D.B. |year=1998|title=Pain and Rehabilitation from Landmine Injury|url=http://e-safe-anaesthesia.org/e_library/10/Pain_and_rehabilitation_from_landmine_injuries_Update_2000.pdf|volume=6|issue=2|pages=91|journal=Update in Anaesthesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohan (1986) indicated in India a total of 424,000 amputees (23,500 annually), of which 10.3% had an onset of disability below the age of 14, amounting to a total of about 43,700 limb deficient children in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, D.

Few low-cost solutions have been created specially for children. Underneath some of them can be found.
[[File:Artificial limbs for a thalidomide child, 1961-1965. (9660575567).jpg|thumbnail|Artificial limbs for a juvenile [[thalidomide]] survivor 1961–1965]]

===Pole and crutch===
This hand-held pole with leather support band or platform for the limb is one of the simplest and cheapest solutions found. It serves well as a short-term solution, but is prone to rapid contracture formation if the limb is not stretched daily through a series of range-of motion (RoM) sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Strait, E. (2006) [http://www.oandp.org/publications/resident/pdf/DevelopingCountries.pdf ''Prosthetics in Deceloping Countries'']. oandp.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamboo, PVC or plaster limbs===
This also fairly simple solution comprises a plaster socket with a bamboo or PVC pipe at the bottom, optionally attached to a prosthetic foot. This solution prevents contractures because the knee is moved through its full RoM. The David Werner Collection, an online database for the assistance of disabled village children, displays manuals of production of these solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, David. [http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe002/dwe00201.html Disabled Village Children]. dinf.ne.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjustable bicycle limb===
This solution is built using a bicycle seat post up side down as foot, generating flexibility and (length) adjustability. It is a very cheap solution, using locally available materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, V. (2004) [http://www.ispo.ca/files/bicycle-prosthesis.pdf A victim assistance solution]. School of Industrial Design, Carleton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sathi Limb===
It is an endoskeletal modular lower limb from India, which uses thermoplastic parts. Its main advantages are the small weight and adaptability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Monolimb===
Monolimbs are non-modular prostheses and thus require more experienced prosthetist for correct fitting, because alignment can barely be changed after production. However, their durability on average is better than low-cost modular solutions.

== Cultural and social theory perspectives ==
A number of theorists have explored the meaning and implications of prosthetic extension of the body. [[Elizabeth Grosz]] writes, "Creatures use tools, ornaments, and appliances to augment their bodily capacities. Are their bodies lacking something, which they need to replace with artificial or substitute organs?...Or conversely, should prostheses be understood, in terms of aesthetic reorganization and proliferation, as the consequence of an inventiveness that functions beyond and perhaps in defiance of pragmatic need?"&lt;ref&gt;Grosz, Elizabeth (2003). "Prosthetic Objects" in ''The State of Architecture at the Beginning of the 21st Century''. pp. 96–97. The Monacelli Press. {{ISBN|1580931340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elaine Scarry]] argues that every artifact recreates and extends the body. Chairs supplement the skeleton, tools append the hands, clothing augments the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World|last=Scarry|first=Elaine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scarry's thinking, "furniture and houses are neither more nor less interior to the human body than the food it absorbs, nor are they fundamentally different from such sophisticated prosthetics as artificial lungs, eyes and kidneys. The consumption of manufactured things turns the body inside out, opening it up ''to'' and ''as'' the culture of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Lupton and Miller (1992). "Streamlining: The Aesthetics of Waste" in Taylor, M. and Preston, J. (eds.) 2006. ''Intimus: Interior Design Theory Reader''. pp. 204–212. {{ISBN|978-0-470-01570-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Wigley]], a professor of architecture, continues this line of thinking about how architecture supplements our natural capabilities, and argues that "a blurring of identity is produced by all prostheses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wigley, Mark |title=Prosthetic Theory: The Disciplining of Architecture|journal=Assemblage|issue=15|pages=6–29|doi=10.2307/3171122 |jstor=3171122|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this work relies on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s earlier characterization of man's relation to objects as one of extension.

'''Rounding''' a [[numerical value]] means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation; for example, replacing ${{formatnum:23.4476}} with ${{formatnum:23.45}}, or the fraction 312/941 with 1/3, or the expression {{radic|2}} with {{formatnum:1.414}}.

Rounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to [[report]] and [[communicate]] than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid [[overprecision|misleadingly precise]] reporting of a computed number, [[measurement]] or [[estimate]]; for example, a quantity that was computed as {{formatnum:123456}} but is known to be [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about {{formatnum:123500}}".

On the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some [[round-off error]] in the reported result.  Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations – especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or [[fixed-point arithmetic]]; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] representation with a fixed number of [[significant digit]]s.  In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally [[Propagation of uncertainty|accumulate]], and in certain [[ill-conditioned]] cases they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "[[#Table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]".

Rounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s.

A wavy [[equals sign]] (&lt;big&gt;'''[[≈]]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;!-- unicode U+2248 --&gt;: ''approximately equal to'') is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 0.75 ≈ 1. This sign was introduced by [[Alfred George Greenhill]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Lankham, [[Bruno Nachtergaele]], [[Anne Schilling]]: ''Linear Algebra as an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics.'' World Scientific, Singapur 2016, {{ISBN|978-981-4730-35-8}}, S. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideal characteristics of rounding methods include:

# Rounding should be done by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.
# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.
#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].
# To be considered rounding, the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] will be a subset of the [[Domain of a function|domain]]. Additionally, the range will have [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt;or less. The classical range is the integers, '''[[Integer|Z]]'''
# Rounding should preserve [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] domain) this translates to removing [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].
# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.

But, because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many methods exist.

As a general rule, rounding is [[Idempotence|idempotent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulisch|first1=Ulrich|date=July 1977|title=Mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=C-26|pages=610–621|doi=10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., once a number has been rounded, rounding it again will not change its value. In practice, rounding functions are also [[Monotonic function|monotonic]].

== Rounding to integer ==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument "round()" procedure. These are true functions with the exception of those that are random-based.

=== Directed rounding to an integer ===
These four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number {{var|x}} to the rounded value {{var|y}} are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[Extended real number line|+∞]], or −∞). Directed rounding is used in [[Interval arithmetic]] and is often required in financial calculations.

If {{var|x}} is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero.  If {{var|x}} is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if {{var|x}} is integer, {{var|y}} is just {{var|x}}.

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]] in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author=Nicholas J. Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0-89871-521-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the examples below, {{math|sgn(''x'')}} refers to the [[sign function]] applied to the original number, {{math|''x''}}.

==== Rounding down ====
* '''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the largest integer that does not exceed {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{floor}(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding up ====
* '''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''',  or '''round towards plus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the smallest integer that is not less than {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{ceil}(x) = \left\lceil x \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding towards zero ====
* '''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the integer part of {{var|x}}, without its fraction digits.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{truncate}(x) = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding away from zero ====
* '''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is {{var|x}}; else {{var|y}} is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that {{var|x}} is between 0 and {{var|y}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rounding to the nearest integer===
Rounding a number {{var|x}} to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when {{var|x}} is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5.

If it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down by the same amount.

When rounding a large set of [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] numbers with [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]] fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the [[expectation (mathematics)|expected]] (average) value of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when we remove numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set. 

In practice [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] numbers are typically used which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.

==== Round half up ====
The following tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards positive infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines.{{citation needed|reason=This is surprising. A confusion with ''round half away from zero''?|date=June 2017}} That is, half-way values of {{var|x}} are always rounded up.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lfloor x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x - 0.5 \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{\lfloor 2x \rfloor}{2} \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

For example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

However, some programming languages (such as Java, Python) define their ''half up'' as ''[[#Round half away from zero|round half away from zero]]'' here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=java.math.RoundingMode|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP|publisher=Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=decimal — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes|publisher=Python Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in [[2's complement]] and similar representations.

==== Round half down ====
One may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards negative infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lceil x - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{\lceil 2x \rceil}{2} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

==== Round half towards zero ====
One may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the conventional ''round half away from zero''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|y}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias towards zero.

==== Round half away from zero ====
The other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This can be more efficient on binary computers because only the first omitted bit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up (on a 1) or down (on a 0). This is one method used when rounding to [[significant figures]] due to its simplicity.

This method, also known as '''commercial rounding''',  treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

==== Round half to even ====
A tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias ''and'' without bias toward/away from zero is '''round half to even'''.   By this convention, if the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the even integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, as does +24.5; while −23.5 becomes −24, as does −24.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', '''odd–even rounding''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603082624/http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf Engineering Drafting Standards Manual] (NASA), X-673-64-1F, p90&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bankers' rounding'''.

This is the default rounding mode used in [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] computing functions and operators (see also [[Nearest integer function]]), and the more sophisticated mode used when rounding to significant figures.

By eliminating bias, repeated rounded addition or subtraction of independent numbers will give a result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly. See [[Random walk#One-dimensional random walk|random walk]] for more.

However, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.

==== Round half to odd ====
A similar tie-breaking rule is '''round half to odd'''.  In this approach, if the fraction of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the odd integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, as does +22.5; while −23.5 becomes −23, as does −22.5.

This method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero.

This variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With ''round half to even'', a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small {{em|denormal}} value would round to a normal non-zero value.  Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for even-based number systems (such as binary and decimal).{{clarify|reason=The ''problem'' would be avoided only for halfway numbers. So, how can this be useful in practice? Any practical example?|post-text=(see [[Talk:Rounding#Round half to odd|talk]])|date=September 2017}}

=== Random-based rounding of an integer ===
==== Alternating tie-breaking ====
One method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

* Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; and so on. (Alternatively the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a [[random seed]].)

If occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence "counting" then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.

==== Random tie-breaking ====

* If the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, choose {{var|y}} randomly among {{nowrap|{{var|x}} + 0.5}} and {{nowrap|{{var|x}} − 0.5}}, with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

Like round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd {{var|y}} values. The advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on 0.5 fractional part does not have to be "remembered".
==== Stochastic rounding ====
Rounding as follows to one of the closest straddling integers with a probability dependent on the proximity is called [[stochastic]] rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.&lt;ref name=stochastic&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision|arxiv=1502.02551 |first1=Suyog|last1=Gupta |first2=Ankur|last2=Angrawl |first3=Kailash|last3=Gopalakrishnan |first4=Pritish|last4=Narayanan |page=3 |date=9 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Round} (x) = \begin{cases}
 \lfloor x \rfloor &amp; \text { with probability } 1 - (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) \\
 \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 &amp; \text { with probability } {x - \lfloor x \rfloor}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.

Stochastic rounding is accurate in a way that a rounding [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can never be. For example, say you started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in [[machine learning]] where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively.&lt;ref name=stochastic /&gt; Stochastic rounding is a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.

== Rounding to other values ==
=== Rounding to a specified multiple ===
The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc.

In general, rounding a number {{var|x}} to a multiple of some specified positive value {{var|m}} entails the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToMultiple}(x, m) = \mathrm{round}(x/m) \times m&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rounding {{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing 2.1784/0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;217.84, then rounding that to 218, and finally computing 218&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.18.

When rounding to a predetermined number of [[significant figure|significant digits]], the increment {{var|m}} depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment {{var|m}} is normally a finite fraction in whatever [[number system]] is used to represent the numbers.  For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal number|decimal number system]] (that is, {{var|m}} is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary number system]] ({{var|m}} is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument "round()" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument "roundToMultiple()" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value {{var|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

=== Logarithmic rounding ===
==== Rounding to a specified power ====
Rounding to a specified ''power'' is very different from rounding to a specified ''multiple''; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2.  The steps, in general, to round a positive number {{var|x}} to a power of some specified integer {{var|b}} greater than 1, are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToPower}(x, b) = b^{\mathrm{round}(\log_b x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Many of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.

==== Scaled rounding ====
This type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified power|rounding to a specified power]]. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.

For example, resistors are supplied with [[preferred number]]s on a logarithmic scale. For example, for resistors with 10% accuracy they are supplied with nominal values 100,  121,  147,  178,  215 etc. If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then log(147)=2.167, log(165)=2.217 and log(178)=2.250. The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 178 therefore a 178 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.

Whether a value {{math|''x'' ∈ (''a'', ''b'')}} rounds to {{var|a}} or {{var|b}} depends upon whether the squared value {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is greater than or less than the product {{math|''ab''}}.  The value 165 rounds to 178 in the resistors example because {{math|1=165&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 27225}} is greater than {{math|1=147 × 178 = 26166}}.

=== Floating-point rounding ===
In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value {{var|x}} into a value {{var|y}} with a specified number of {{em|significant}} digits.  In other words, {{var|y}} should be a multiple of a number {{var|m}} that depends on the magnitude of {{var|x}}.  The number {{var|m}} is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor {{var|s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and an integer base {{var|b}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when "rounding away from zero", or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if {{var|x}} is negative), when "rounding towards zero". The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to nearest'' is always the appropriate infinity.

=== Rounding to a simple fraction ===
In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number {{var|x}} to a "neat" fraction — that is, the nearest fraction {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|m}}/{{var|n}} whose numerator {{var|m}} and denominator {{var|n}} do not exceed a given maximum.  This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit {{var|m}}.  This problem is related to [[Farey sequence]]s, the [[Stern–Brocot tree]], and [[Continued fraction#Best rational approximations|continued fractions]].

=== Rounding to an available value ===
Finished [[lumber]], writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then "round" to some standard size using phrases such as "round down to nearest standard value", "round up to nearest standard value", or "round to nearest standard value".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf "Zener Diode Voltage Regulators"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/tester-3.html "Build a Mirror Tester"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a set of [[preferred value]]s is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest [[preferred value]] to any given value can be seen as a form of [[#Scaled rounding|scaled rounding]]. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trump, Christine Schneider.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rounding in other contexts ==
=== Dithering and error diffusion ===
When digitizing [[continuous signal]]s, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, [[dithering]], and a related technique, [[error diffusion]], are normally used. A related technique called [[pulse-width modulation]] is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.

Error diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.

As a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|0.9204}}, {{math|0.7451}}, and {{math|0.3091}} occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}.  In this case the cumulative sums, {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|1=1.8881 = 0.9677 + 0.9204}}, {{math|1=2.6332 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451}}, and {{math|1=2.9423 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451 + 0.3091}}, are each rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1.89}}, {{math|2.63}}, and {{math|2.94}}.  The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1=0.92 = 1.89 − 0.97}}, {{math|1=0.74 = 2.63 − 1.89}}, and {{math|1=0.31 = 2.94 − 2.63}}.

=== Monte Carlo arithmetic ===
Monte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in [[Monte Carlo method]]s where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate how stable the computation is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/mca/CSD-970014.ps.gz|title=Monte Carlo Arithmetic: a framework for the statistical analysis of roundoff errors|last1=Parker|first1=D Stott|last2=Eggert|first2=Paul R.|date=28 March 2000|publisher=IEEE Computation in Science and Engineering|last3=Pierce|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exact computation with rounded arithmetic ===
It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with integer domain and range.  For example, if we know that an integer {{var|n}} is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting {{var|n}} to a floating-point value {{var|z}}, computing the approximate square root {{var|x}} of {{var|z}} with floating point, and then rounding {{var|x}} to the nearest integer {{var|y}}.  If {{var|n}} is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in {{var|x}} will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value {{var|y}} will be the exact square root of {{var|n}}.  This is essentially why [[Slide rule|slide rules]] could be used for exact arithmetic.
=== Double rounding ===
{{Anchor|Sticky rounding|Rounding to odd}}
Rounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding.&lt;ref&gt;Another case where double rounding always leads to the same value as directly rounding to the final precision is when the radix is odd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borman|first1=Phil|last2=Chatfield|first2=Marion|title=Avoid the perils of using rounded data|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|date=10 November 2015|volume=115|pages=506–507|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2015.07.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708515300753}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.

In ''Martinez v. Allstate'' and ''Sendejo v. Farmers'', litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain |author=Deborah R. Hensler |pages=255–293 | isbn=0-8330-2601-1 |publisher=RAND| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computer languages and the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard dictate that in straightforward calculations the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with [[x87]] floating point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a [[strictfp]] qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.

In some algorithms, an intermediate result is computed and rounded and then, after more computation, must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding error can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding precision for the intermediate computation and/or by using a proven rounding method for intermediate and final rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=J Strother|last2=Lynch|first2=Tom|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Matt|date=1996|title=A mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the kernel of the AMD5K86 floating-point division algorithm|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/divide_paper.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=47|citeseerx=10.1.1.43.3309|doi=10.1109/12.713311|accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00080427v2/document |title=Emulation of a FMA and correctly-rounded sums: proved algorithms using rounding to odd |last1=Boldo |first1=Sylvie |last2=Melquiond |first2=Guillaume |date=2008 |website=HAL - Inria |format=PDF |doi=10.1109/TC.2007.70819 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21718#c25|title=21718 – real.c rounding not perfect|author=|date=|website=gcc.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Table-maker's dilemma ===
[[William Kahan]] coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} correctly rounded for {{em|every}} two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary [[transcendental function]]s mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it {{em|correctly}} to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kahan |first=William |title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[IEEE 754|IEEE floating-point standard]] guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, [[fused multiply–add]], square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.

Using the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] and [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |id={{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print) --&gt; |chapter=Chapter 12: Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programming packages offer correct rounding. The [[MPFR|GNU MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in double precision:
* [[IBM]]'s libultim, in rounding to nearest only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libultim.3|title=libultim – ultimate correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sun Microsystems]]'s libmcr, in the 4 rounding modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libmcr.3|title=libmcr – correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CRlibm, written in the old Arénaire team (LIP, [[ENS Lyon]]). It supports the 4 rounding modes and is proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027224938/http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm|archivedate=2016-10-27|title=CRlibm – Correctly Rounded mathematical library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist [[computable number]]s for which a rounded value can never be determined no matter how many digits are calculated. Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the [[halting problem]]. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but [[unprovable]], then the result of rounding the following value up to the next integer cannot be determined: 10&lt;sup&gt;−{{var|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; where {{var|n}} is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0 if there is no such number. The result is 1 if such a number exists and 0 if no such number exists. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

=== Interaction with string searches ===
Rounding can adversely affect a string search for a number.  For example, {{math|''π''}} rounded to four digits is "3.1416" but a simple search for this string will not discover "3.14159" or any other value of {{math|''π''}} rounded to more than four digits.  In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for "3.1415", which is {{math|''π''}} truncated to four digits, will discover values of {{math|''π''}} truncated to more than four digits.

== History ==
The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division.  Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. "YBC 7289 clay tablet". 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rounded approximations to [[pi|π]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient—see [[base 60#Examples|base 60 examples]].

The ''round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940.  The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory.  In the 1906 fourth edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=05170001&amp;view=50&amp;frames=0&amp;seq=48|title=Probability and theory of errors|author=|date=|website=historical.library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Simpson Woodward]] called this "the computer's rule" indicating that it was then in common use by [[human computer]]s who calculated mathematical tables. [[Churchill Eisenhart]] indicated the practice was already "well established" in data analysis by the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Production and Management Engineering|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=187–223|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedtechniqu00colu|author=Churchill Eisenhart|editors=Eisenhart, Hastay and Wallis|accessdate=30 January 2014|chapter=Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the term ''bankers' rounding'' remains more obscure.  If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find.  To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts''&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that "half-way" amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of [[interval arithmetic]].

Currently, tendency to round around 5 or 2 is used in the number of research. To be more precise [[age heaping]] was used in the number of studies by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]], to evaluate the numeracy level of the ancient populations. He came up with [[ABCC index]], which enables the comparison of the [[numeracy]] among regions possible without any historical sources where the population [[literacy]] was measured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capita |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=2009 |volume=69 |pages=783-808}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Rounding functions in programming languages ==
Most [[programming language]]s provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways.  The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero).  This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an [[integer (computing)|integer]] [[variable (programming)|variable]], or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array data type|array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard [[library (computing)|libraries]] of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and towards zero).  The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer.  Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[Double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary.  This approach may avoid spurious [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]] since floating-point types have a larger range than integer types.  Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300.  In addition, many languages provide a [[printf]] or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision'').  On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

On the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and in their [[Interface description language|IDL]] interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[JavaScript]] or [[ECMAScript]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification|author=|date=|website=ecma-international.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; interface bindings).

== Other rounding standards ==
Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

===US weather observations===
In a guideline issued in mid-1966,&lt;ref&gt;OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm |date=1999-04-20 }}, Washington, DC., 104 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the "round half up" tie-breaking rule.  For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1.  Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was "round half away from zero".

=== Negative zero in meteorology ===
{{main|Signed zero#Scientific uses}}

Some [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write "&amp;minus;0" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and &amp;minus;0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer.  This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the [[Celsius]] scale, where below zero indicates freezing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== byte values ===
Because digital information is stored in binary format, computer memory is usually produced in sizes which are a power of 2.  So a common size is 1024 bytes (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), and this can be referred to as 1 [[kilobyte]].  Similarly, {{formatnum:1048576}} (2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) can be referred to as 1 [[megabyte]].  This may or may not be considered rounding.  More information on the different representations is on the entry for [[kilobyte]].

The '''Seljuk stucco figures''' are [[stucco]] ([[plaster]]) figures found in the region of the [[Seljuk Empire]], from its "golden age" between the 11th and 13th centuries. They decorated the inner walls and friezes of Seljuk palaces, together with other ornamented stucco ornaments, concealing the wall behind them. The figures were painted bright-colored and often gilded. They represented royal figures and were symbols of power and authority. 

==Islamic art of Seljuk==
The Seljuks were a [[Turkish people|Turkic]] dynasty of [[Central Asia]]n nomadic origins, who became the new rulers of the eastern Islamic world after defeating the [[Ghaznavids]] in the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]], and the [[Buyid dynasty]]. Following these victories, the Seljuks established themselves as the new patrons of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and [[Sunni Islam]]. In only half-a-century, the Seljuks managed to create a vast empire encompassing modern [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and much of [[Anatolia]]. Under the Seljuks, Iran enjoyed a period of cultural prosperity. Multitudes of architecture and arts were developed during the period, and influenced later artistic developments in the region and the surrounding.{{sfn|Yalman|2001}}

In ceramics, fine motifs were created in underglaze painting, luster decorations, and polychrome painting. Metal objects were decorated with [[inlay]]s of silver and gold. The Seljuks developed many figurative motifs with frequent depiction of animals, men, and women.&lt;ref name="dk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/seljuks |title=The Seljuks and their Successors |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |publisher=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anthropomorphic representation of figures are not rare at all in the Muslim culture. Whereas iconic image in holy places e.g. mosques are strictly forbidden, in secular places, depiction of figures are common.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

==Seljuk palaces==
All the Seljuk palaces are now in ruins. Excavations indicate that these palaces had once been decorated with tiles and with stucco wall [[relief]]s of geometric patterns and figures. In Lashgari Bazar, a ruin of former Ghaznavid period palace, polychrome [[fresco]]es depicting 44 soldiers were found decorating the lower floor of the audience hall. They all have similar round faces and almond-shaped eyes, traditionally associated with the [[Turkish people|Turks]] of Central Asia.{{sfn|Öney|1984|pp=133-5}}  

The stucco figures would have decorated similar royal palaces in the audience hall or the royal court. They were found decorating large palaces of the Seljuk sultans, or smaller royal courts of the local vassals or successors.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt; The stucco figures may be part of larger stucco geometric ornamentation which conceals the base wall behind it. One example of stucco figures in complete form comes from the late 12th century [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], which depicts the enthroned Seljuk Sultan Tughril II (1194) surrounded by his officers. Similar examples were found in [[Bast, Afghanistan]], in [[Samarkand]], and in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="kianush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/seljuks.htm |title=THE SELJUKS 11th - 13th Century |last=Kianush |first=K. |date=1999 |website=IRANSAGA |publisher=Art Arena |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were painted in bright colors of red, blue, black, and gilded with gold. The dark room in the palace where they were placed means that this figure needs to stand out as much as possible.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Persian - Standing Warrior Holding a Sword - Walters 241.jpg|thumb|left|Stucco figures of a warrior discovered in Iran. This is painted with red, blue, black, and gilded with gold.]]
Stucco or plaster is a soft, cement-like water-based material that is easy to carve when dry and [[mold]] when still wet. Its lightness makes it easy to affix to walls. Many 12th-century stucco figures survived in pristine condition because of the preserving dryness of the desert where they were found. Seljuk stucco figures were painted in bright colors of blue (powdered [[lapis lazuli]]), red (powdered [[ruby]]), and black colors, and were gilded with gold.&lt;ref name="metwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/451909 |title=Standing Figure with Jeweled Headdress |date=2017 |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The figures were representations of power. In a royal palace setting, they represent figures related to the power of the empire, e.g. royal guards, royal viziers, courtiers or [[emir|amir]]. Warrior figures were depicted clutching swords. They wear rich colored caftans, trousers, [[tiraz|tiraz bands]] and long boots. Royal figures were depicted wearing crowns. The two figures in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] are wearing crowns, one figure is wearing the winged crown, an ancient symbol of authority which was first recorded in a 3rd century [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] coins. All of the Seljuk stucco figures have round faces with typical high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes, known as the Turkic moon face, which reflect the indicating the Turkic and Mongol ethnic type.&lt;ref name="dk"/&gt; The stucco figures were usually displayed in a pomp and circumstance setting, enhancing the actual ceremonies that took place in the room where the figures were set.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

'''Sexual addiction''', also known as '''sex addiction''', is characterized as a state of [[compulsive]] participation or engagement in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], particularly [[sexual intercourse]], despite negative consequences.&lt;ref name="NHM addiction-reward-reinforcement"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 364–365, 375 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= The defining feature of addiction is compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;compulsive eating, shopping, gambling, and sex–so-called "natural addictions"–&amp;nbsp;...

Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders.

[[Animal research]] has been established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate [[drug addiction]] in laboratory animals; however, {{As of|2018|lc=yes|post=,}} sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]] medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) publishes and periodically updates the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), a widely recognized compendium of mental health diagnostics.&lt;ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience|vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|year=2009|isbn=9780071481274|veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=364–368|chapter=Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders|quote=The defining feature of addiction is compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences.&amp;nbsp;...Addictive drugs are both rewarding and reinforcing. A reward is a stimulus that the brain interprets as intrinsically positive. A reinforcing stimulus is one that increases the probability that behaviors paired with it will be repeated. Not all reinforcers are rewarding—for example, a negative or punishing stimulus might reinforce avoidance behaviors.&amp;nbsp;... Familiar pharmacologic terms such as tolerance, dependence, and sensitization are useful in describing some of the time-dependent processes that underlie addiction.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;br /&gt;''Dependence'' is defined as an adaptive state that develops in response to repeated drug administration, and is unmasked during ''withdrawal'', which occurs when drug taking stops. Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria.  While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction because they do not occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine).  The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena.  Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfortunate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical reviews and position statements===
In November 2016, the [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] (AASECT), the official body for sex and relationship therapy in the United States, issued a position statement on Sex Addiction that states that AASECT, "...does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aasect.org/position-sex-addiction|title=AASECT Position on Sex Addiction - AASECT:: American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists|website=Aasect.org|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counselling ===
As of 2017, none of the official regulatory bodies for [[Sex therapy|Psychosexual Counselling]] or [[Relationship counseling|Sex and Relationship therapy]], have accepted sex addiction as a distinct entity with associated treatment protocols. Indeed, some practitioners regard sex addiction as a potentially harmful diagnosis and draw parallels with gay conversion therapy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, treatment for sex addiction is more often provided by addiction professionals than psychosexual specialists.

According to a systematic review from 2014, prevalence rates of sexual addiction and related sexual disorders ranges from 3%&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;6%.&lt;ref name="Systematic review - yet another DSM fail"/&gt; Some studies suggest that sex addicts are disproportionately male, at 80%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.1843magazine.com/features/can-you-really-be-addicted-to-sex&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sex addiction as a term first emerged in the mid-1970s when various members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] sought to apply the principles of [[twelve-step program|12-steps]] toward sexual recovery from serial infidelity and other unmanageable compulsive sex behaviors that were similar to the powerlessness and un-manageability they experienced with alcoholism.&lt;ref name="SLAABIGBOOK"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine Fellowship |title=Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous |isbn=0-9615701-1-3 |date=June 1986 |publisher=Augustine Fellowship |oclc=13004050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including [[Sex Addicts Anonymous]], [[Sexaholics Anonymous]], [[Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous]], and [[Sexual Compulsives Anonymous]].&lt;!-- are these [[WP:CAPS]] wiolations, like 12-Step was? --&gt;

Animal research involving rats that exhibit compulsive sexual behavior has identified that this behavior is mediated through the same molecular mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug addiction.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ΔFosB reward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph and sex addiction" /&gt; Sexual activity is an [[intrinsic reward]] that has been shown to act as a [[positive reinforcer]], strongly activate the [[reward system]], and induce the accumulation of [[ΔFosB]] in part of the [[striatum]] (specifically, the [[nucleus accumbens]]).&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ΔFosB reward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph and sex addiction" /&gt; Chronic and excessive activation of certain pathways within the reward system and the accumulation of ΔFosB in a specific group of neurons within the nucleus accumbens has been directly implicated in the development of the compulsive behavior that characterizes addiction.&lt;ref name="ΔFosB reward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurobiology of addiction August 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koob GF, Volkow ND | title = Neurobiology of addiction: a neurocircuitry analysis | journal = Lancet Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 760–773 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27475769 | doi = 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)00104-8 | quote = Drug addiction represents a dramatic dysregulation of motivational circuits that is caused by a combination of exaggerated incentive salience and habit formation, reward deficits and stress surfeits, and compromised executive function in three stages. The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/intoxication stage involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala. Molecular genetic studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that act in neurocircuitry associated with the development and maintenance of addiction that might mediate initial vulnerability, maintenance, and relapse associated with addiction.&amp;nbsp;... Substance-induced changes in transcription factors can also produce competing effects on reward function.&lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt; For example, repeated substance use activates accumulating levels of ΔFosB, and animals with elevated ΔFosB exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, leading to the hypothesis that ΔFosB might be a sustained molecular trigger or switch that helps initiate and maintain a state of addiction.&lt;sup&gt;141,142&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

These newly constructed networks function very efficiently via new pathways as soon as drugs of abuse are further taken&amp;nbsp;... In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3.

This depends on ΔFosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for ΔFosB.

Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group. Together, these findings support a critical role for DeltaFosB expression in the NAc in the reinforcing effects of sexual behavior and sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance.&amp;nbsp;... both drug addiction and sexual addiction represent pathological forms of neuroplasticity along with the emergence of aberrant behaviors involving a cascade of neurochemical changes mainly in the brain's rewarding circuitry. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestler" /&gt; Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olsen CM | title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 1109–1122 |date=December 2011  | pmid = 21459101 | pmc = 3139704 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010 | quote =  Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&amp;nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&amp;nbsp;...

In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. This syndrome is characterized by a medication-induced increase in (or compulsive) engagement in non-drug rewards such as gambling, shopping, or sex (Evans et al, 2006; Aiken, 2007; Lader, 2008)."}}&lt;!--The following link is outside the template to make it hyperlinked while appearing to be part of the quote.--&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/table/T1/?report=objectonly Table 1]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ΔFosB reward" /&gt; Thus, ΔFosB is also the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well,&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph and sex addiction" /&gt; and sexual addictions in particular, since ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward.&lt;ref name="ΔFosB reward"/&gt; Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual reward possess cross-sensitization effects and act on common biomolecular mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity which are mediated through ΔFosB.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amph and sex addiction"&gt;&lt;!--Supplemental primary source--&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pitchers KK, Vialou V, Nestler EJ, Laviolette SR, Lehman MN, Coolen LM | title = Natural and drug rewards act on common neural plasticity mechanisms with ΔFosB as a key mediator | journal = J.

Sexual behavior is highly rewarding (Tenk et al., 2009), and sexual experience causes sensitized drug-related behaviors, including cross-sensitization to amphetamine (Amph)-induced locomotor activity (Bradley and Meisel, 2001; Pitchers et al., 2010a) and enhanced Amph reward (Pitchers et al., 2010a). Moreover, sexual experience induces neural plasticity in the NAc similar to that induced by psychostimulant exposure, including increased dendritic spine density (Meisel and Mullins, 2006; Pitchers et al., 2010a), altered glutamate receptor trafficking, and decreased synaptic strength in prefrontal cortex-responding NAc shell neurons (Pitchers et al., 2012). Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis (Pitchers et al., 2010a), and glutamate receptor trafficking (Pitchers et al., 2012).

The controversy surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, in a clinical setting. As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans;drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt; Moreover, some research suggests compulsive engagement in sexual behavior despite negative consequences in animal models.Since current diagnostic models use drug-related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions,&lt;ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw" /&gt; these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting.&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt; Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently "insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders".&lt;ref name=dsm-5/&gt; A 2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the "lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."&lt;ref name="Systematic review - yet another DSM fail" /&gt;

'''Shwartzman phenomenon''', also known as '''Shwartzman reaction''', is a rare reaction of a body to particular types of [[toxins]], called [[endotoxins]], which cause [[thrombosis]] in the affected [[Biological tissue|tissue]].  A clearing of the thrombosis results in a [[reticuloendothelial blockade]], which prevents re-clearing of the thrombosis caused by a repeat introduction of the toxin.  That will cause tissue [[necrosis]].  Shwartzman phenomenon is usually observed during delivery or abortion, when foreign bodies are introduced into the tissues of the female [[reproductive system]].

The Shwartzman phenomenon is named for [[Gregory Shwartzman]], the doctor at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City]] who was the first to develop the concept of [[immune system]] hypersensitivity in the 1920s.
This reaction was experimented using ''Neisseria meningitidis'' endotoxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountsinaifpa.org/patient-care/practices/allergy-and-clinical-immunology/about-us/firsts-in-clinical-immunology|title=Mount Sinai Faculty Practice Associates - Firsts in Clinical Immunology|accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''''''sustainable''' habitat''' is an [[ecosystem]] that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced.  Thus the habitat can continue into future tie without external infusions of resource. Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[habitat]] that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature, if it is to be successful. Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms, physical resources and functions. Organisms from many different [[biome]]s can be brought together to fulfill various ''ecological niches''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The term often refers to sustainable [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s, which typically involve some form of [[green building]] or [[environmental planning]].

==Overview==
In creating the sustainable habitats, [[environmental scientist]]s, designers, engineers and [[architecture|architects]] must consider no element as a [[waste]] product to be disposed of somewhere off site, but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on. Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing [[pollution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''University of Puget Sound''' (commonly referred to as '''UPS''' or simply '''Puget Sound''') is a private [[liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. Puget Sound offers [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Music]], [[Master of Arts in Teaching]], [[Master of Education]], [[Master of Occupational Therapy]], and [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] degrees. The college draws approximately 2,600 students from 44 states and 16 countries. It offers 1,200 courses each year in more than 50 traditional and interdisciplinary areas of study.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/ |title=About Puget Sound |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by what is now the [[United Methodist Church]], Puget Sound is governed today by an independent board of trustees. The college maintains a relationship and affiliation with the United Methodist Church based on shared history and values held in common, including the importance of access to a high-quality education, academic freedom, social justice, environmental stewardship, and global focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/united-methodist-church-affiliation/ |title=United Methodist Church Affiliation |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2017 |accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Puget Sound was founded by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1888 in downtown Tacoma. The idea for a college in Tacoma originated with [[Charles Henry Fowler]], who had previously been the president of [[Northwestern University]]. Fowler was in Tacoma for a Methodist conference when he spoke of his vision of a Christian institution of learning in the area. The conference released a report:

{{quote|We commit ourselves...heartily to the building up within the bounds of the conference of an institution of learning which shall by its ample facilities...command the respect and patronage of Methodist people within the bounds of the territory...and so by united and prayerful efforts advance to the establishment of a school of learning which shall be a praise in all the land.}}

Two cities vied for the location of the school: [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. The committee eventually decided on Tacoma. A charter was drawn up and filed in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] on March 17, 1888. This date marks the legal beginning of the school. At this time, the school's legal title was "The [[Puget Sound]] University".&lt;ref&gt;Klahowya 1913 - University of Puget Sound Yearbook - Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1890, UPS opened its doors, taking in 88 students.

The beginnings of the school were marked by moral conviction: students were warned against intoxicating liquors, visits to saloons, gambling, tobacco use, and obscene drawings or writings on the college grounds. The university also had a financially tumultuous beginning. There was no endowment and the school often struggled for funds to pay the professors. It moved locations three times in 13 years and, at one time, the school was merged with [[Portland University]] (former campus is now the [[University of Portland]]). It opened up a year later (1899) back in Tacoma on the 9th and G Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=342805050&amp;size=o Walter Davis, "University of Puget Sound," in ''Told By the Pioneers'', Works Progress Administration, 3 vols. 1937-38; scanned copy archived at the Flickr page of the University of Puget Sound Department of Politics and Government]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, the school was "reborn" and re-incorporated as a different entity, different trustees, and a different name: the "University of Puget Sound".

[[File:UPS - Warner Gym 01.jpg|thumb|right|Warner Gym, one of the original 1924 buildings]]
The character of the school changed dramatically during the presidency of Edward H. Todd (1913–1942), who worked tirelessly to bring financial and academic stability. During his tenure, the "Million Dollar Campaign" was started, raising $1,022,723 for buildings, equipment, and endowment. With this money, the campus moved in 1924&lt;ref&gt;1924 Tamanawas&lt;/ref&gt; to its current location in the residential [[North Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington|North End of Tacoma]], with five buildings, setting a stylistic tone for the institution. In 1914 the university was renamed the "College of Puget Sound".

President R. Franklin Thompson (1942–1973) led a massive physical and institutional expansion: During this era almost all of the university's buildings were constructed. In 1960, the university's name changed from the "College of Puget Sound" back to the "University of Puget Sound", as it is known today.

Phillip M. Phibbs presided from 1973 to 1992 and endeavored to change the tone of Puget Sound. In 1980, the university divested its attachment with the Methodist Church, and an independent board of trustees assumed full fiscal responsibility of the university. Also during this time, the university began to focus on undergraduate education excellence, phasing out all off-campus programs except the law school and most graduate programs. During this time the library collections were broadened and the faculty greatly expanded.

With the advent of President Susan Resneck Pierce (1992–2003), the law school was promptly sold to [[Seattle University]], in a move that was calculated to focus the university's resources on its undergraduate campus. During her tenure, the university completed almost $100 million of new construction and renovation. [[Collins Memorial Library]] and four academic buildings were renovated, and Wyatt Hall was constructed to house the growing class and office space needs of the Humanities Department. Trimble Residence Hall was constructed, bringing on-campus student residency to 65%. SAT scores rose from 1067 to 1253 and the endowment more than tripled.

Puget Sound's president from 2003 to early 2016 was Ronald R. Thomas, affectionately called "Ron Thom" by many students, a scholar of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[literature]], and the former vice-President of [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]].

In February 2016, the university announced the selection of Dr. Isiaah Crawford to be its next president, upon Thomas' retirement. President Crawford assumed office on July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/office-of-the-president/biography/|title=About the President|last=|first=|date=2016-02-26|website=|publisher=University of Puget Sound|accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UPS - Harned &amp; Thompson Halls along Union Avenue 01.jpg|thumb|right|Harned and Thompson Halls, along Union Avenue. Harned Hall is at center, with wings of Thompson Hall on either side.]]

Thompson Hall, home of the sciences at the university, underwent a major renovation, including the construction of a new wing (Harned Hall, completed 2006) on the building's western side against Union Avenue and extensive renovations to the current wings and courtyard to allow for upgraded labs and facilities. The entire project was completed in mid 2008. The entire complex is now known locally as "The Science Center at Puget Sound." The now completely enclosed courtyard contains a striking [[Plexiglas]] structure where a coffee shop, Oppenheimer Cafe, is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/news-and-events/campus-news/details/344/ |title=University of Puget Sound Announces Dedication of Harned Hall |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2013 Puget Sound opened Thomas Hall, a residence hall for upper-division students featuring 11 "houses" organized around five academic-residential programs: the Humanities Program, environmental outdoor leadership, international experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and the Honors Program. The hall is home for 135 students, and includes a seminar room, four studies, and an event/meeting space for approximately 150 people, accommodating special events, guest lectures, performances and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/new-residence-hall/ |title=Commencement Hall |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The campus is located in [[North Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington|North Tacoma, Washington]] in a primarily residential setting a few minutes' walk from downtown Proctor and the [[Sixth Avenue (Tacoma)|Sixth Avenue]] district.

The campus is made up of mainly brick buildings in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]]- [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] architectural style. Buildings are mostly arranged into quads. The three main quads are the North Quad and South Quad, which contain residence halls, and Karlen Quad, which contains Jones Hall, Collins Memorial Library and the Music Building. The library was designed by Tacoma architect [[Silas E. Nelsen]] in 1954. It was later renovated.

President Thomas recently wrote a piece explaining his opinion that new buildings should maintain the gothic style that the university is known for.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ronald R. [http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/mission--goals/sacred-spaces/ UPS Master Plan: Sacred Spaces]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic buildings===
Harned Hall, named for alumnus and local real estate developer H.C. "Joe" Harned, was dedicated on September 29, 2006. The building is {{convert|51000|sqft|m2}} and cost $25 million to construct. It was designed and built to meet the [[Green building#US Green Building Council|US Green Building Council]]'s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Standard. The building features labs for [[biology]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[environmental science]], and [[physics]], a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} courtyard with a crystalline glass gazebo in the center, a [[Foucault pendulum]] designed by Alan Thorndike, as well as [[Gray whale]] skeleton named Willy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/science-center/science-on-display/ |title=Science on Display |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UPS - Wyatt Hall 03.jpg|thumb|right|Wyatt Hall]]
After Harned Hall was completed, the university began a $38 million renovation of Thompson Hall, the "old" science building. Harned and Thompson Halls form a square with a courtyard in the middle, and are collectively named the Science Center. Thompson Hall has an area of {{convert|121000|sqft|m2}} and was originally constructed in 1968. The renovation was completed in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Office of University Relations. [http://www.ups.edu/documents/CaseforThompsonHall.pdf The Science Center at Puget Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyatt Hall is the second newest academic building on campus, dedicated in 2003. It houses the English, History,  Foreign Languages &amp; Literature, Politics &amp; Government, Philosophy, Honors, Science Technology &amp; Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/x3013.xml Department of Science Technology &amp; Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219234159/http://www.ups.edu/x3013.xml |date=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classics, and Religion departments. Many of the classrooms in the building are seminar style, meaning a circle of tables that students sit at to encourage discussion between students and the professor, rather than a lecture. The building features glass art by [[Dale Chihuly]] that represents the ivy leaves covering the campus buildings.

The Wheelock Student Center, known as the "SUB" (Student Union Building) is the main hub of life on campus. It features a rotunda used for lectures and catered events, KUPS (the campus radio station), the cafeteria and dining area, Diversions Cafe (a student-run coffee shop), and The Cellar (a student-run pizza parlor).

[[File:UPS - McIntyre Hall 01.jpg|thumb|left|McIntyre Hall]]
Other buildings include McIntyre Hall, home of the School of Business and Leadership, the Departments of Economics, Sociology and Anthropology, and [[International Political Economy]]; Howarth Hall, home of the School of Education, Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Career and Employment Services, and more; Jones Hall, home of theatre arts, communication studies, and several administrative offices, including the Office of the President; and the Music Building (which is the only building on campus without a name). Kittredge Hall, the original student union building, now houses the art department and Kittredge Gallery. The Gallery is now affiliated with Tacoma Art Museum.

Collins Memorial Library&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/library Collins Memorial Library]&lt;/ref&gt; houses over 400,000 books and over 130,000 periodicals, is a partial federal government repository, and has substantial microform holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/x19192.xml Collins Library Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928084124/http://www.ups.edu/x19192.xml |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library was named after former trustee Everill S. Collins. The current Library building was built in 1954. A larger addition was completed in 1974. In 2000, a major renovation brought new technology and media resources into the Library's spaces, making it one of the most popular campus gathering places for students.

Construction for the William T. and Gail T. Weyerhaeuser Center for Health Sciences began in spring 2010. At {{convert|42500|sqft|m2}}, the center provides the resources and flexibility needed to support new areas of study in the fields of health and behavioral sciences. Specially designed to encourage cross-disciplinary interaction, the center houses Puget Sound's undergraduate departments in exercise science and psychology, graduate programs in occupational and physical therapy, and interdisciplinary program in neuroscience. Designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson/Seattle, Weyerhaeuser Hall conforms to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/weyerhaeuser-hall/ |title=The William T. and Gail T.

===Residential buildings===

[[File:UPS - Schiff Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Schiff Residence Hall]]Harrington, Schiff, Anderson/Langdon, Smith, and Oppenheimer halls make up what is called the "North Quad", and Todd/Phibbs, Regester, Seward, Trimble, and Thomas Hall make up the "South Quad." Theme Row, which runs to the south end of campus, contains around 20 different theme houses that students may apply to live in.  The Music House is the longest standing house, originating in 1989. After the Music House, the Outhaus and the Track and Cross Country Theme House are the two longest standing houses. There are also about 55 non-theme university-owned houses available.

Currently around 65% of students live on campus. Students are required to live on campus for their first two years of enrollment at the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pugetsound.edu/admission/faq/faq-student-life/ FAQ - Student Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the university upgraded residential Internet bandwidth by more than two-fold, to 100 [[Mbit/s]]. During that year, a new connection to the Washington State K-20 Educational Network was also installed, bringing the university's aggregate [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to 150 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.pugetsound.edu/TSmaintenance/?p=872 Puget Sound Technology Services Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Further bandwidth upgrades have brought student bandwidth to 250 Mbit/s for the 2012-13 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ups.edu/technologyservices/2012/04/11/residential-bandwidth-increases-to-250-mbps/ Puget Sound Technology Services Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The university offers more than 50 traditional and nontraditional areas of study in the liberal arts and sciences, as well as graduate programs in [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], and education.&lt;ref name="harned"&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/x2234.xml Dedication of new science building, Harned Hall, set for September 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121110857/http://www.ups.edu/x2234.xml |date=2005-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The student to faculty ratio is 12 to 1.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

==Athletics==
[[File:UPS - Peyton Field scoreboard 01.jpg|thumb|Scoreboard, Peyton Field]]

The Puget Sound athletics teams are known as the "Loggers" with "Grizz the Logger" as their mascot. The Loggers participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[Northwest Conference]], competing with [[George Fox University]], [[Lewis and Clark College]], [[Linfield College]], [[Pacific University]], [[Pacific Lutheran University]], [[Whitman College]], [[Whitworth University]], and [[Willamette University]].

===Varsity sports===
The University offers 23 different varsity sports teams: Men's [[Baseball]], Men's and Women's [[Basketball]], Men's and Women's [[Sport rowing|Crew]], Men's and Women's [[Cross country running|Cross Country]], Men's [[American football|Football]], Men's and Women's [[Golf]], Women's [[Lacrosse]], Men's and Women's [[Soccer]], Women's [[Softball]], Men's and Women's [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]], Men's and Women's [[Tennis]], Men's and Women's Indoor and Outdoor [[Track &amp; Field]], and Women's [[Volleyball]].  On a minor note, former national soccer team coach [[Bruce Arena]] got his coaching start at Puget Sound in 1976 as head of the men's soccer team.

===Club sports===

There are both men's and women's club soccer teams, as well as men's club lacrosse (which competes in the [[Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League]]). The university also has a men's club [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] team known as the "Postmen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/a/upsultimate.com/www/ |title=UPS Ultimate |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a women's club Ultimate team known as "Clear Cut".

The university is well known for its successful men's rugby club. The club has achieved regional and national success over the past three seasons under coach Mark Sullivan. In 2012 the club was ranked 10th in the nation for small college rugby and traveled to Cal Maritime University in Vallejo, California for the regional tournament. The success of the men's rugby club is attributed to the hard work of the players and continual dedication of their coaches. Also, an intense rivalry has developed between the UPS rugby club and the Seattle University rugby club. Known as the Seatac Cup, UPS has achieved eight straight victories over their rivals. In 2012, the victory over Seattle University clinched the Loggers' playoff spot.

The UPS Loggers hockey team was founded in 2005 and is currently an [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] division II team.  The team's most prominent victories include defeating the University of Washington Huskies in a 3-game series in the 2006-2007 season, and the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the 2007-2008 season.  Loggers hockey is subsidized by ASUPS (the Associated Students of UPS) student body and ticket sales for home games.  Home games are currently played at the Sprinker Ice Arena in south Tacoma.  Players come from the student body, and mostly consist of students hailing from Canada, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and states on the East Coast.

===Achievements===

Several sports teams have achieved some degree of success in recent years:
*The men's basketball team won three straight Northwest Conference championships beginning in 2004, with an average .826 winning percentage over the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. In 2005, the [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] Loggers defeated the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] Highlanders of the [[University of California, Riverside]], making it their first Division I defeat since the 1970s. In the 2009 regular season, the Loggers went an undefeated 16-0 in Northwest Conference play, becoming the first team in conference history to do so, capturing the conference title in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/mbasketball.xml University of Puget Sound :: Basketball (M)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502170129/http://www.ups.edu/mbasketball.xml |date=2006-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From 1992 to 1995 the UPS women's Cross-Country team were national champions. This tremendous 4-year run earned coach Sam Ring coach of the year honors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[NAIA national women's cross country championship|NAIA Women's Cross-Country Records Page]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The women's soccer team took second place in the nation in 2004 and ended the 2005 season ranked fifth nationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/w_soccer_RB/2008/wsoc%20DIII%202008.pdf Division 3 Women's Records, page 14]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The women's swim team won the Northwest Conference championship for eleven consecutive years, from 1997 through 2007, before finally finishing second to [[Whitworth University]] in 2008.  This remains a Northwest Conference record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/wswimming.xml University of Puget Sound Women's Swimming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126155740/http://www.ups.edu/wswimming.xml |date=2006-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Logger women reclaimed their title in 2009.
*The women's basketball team made the [[NCAA Women's Division III Basketball Championship|Division III Elite 8]] in the 2007 season after upsetting #12 ranked [[McMurry University]] and #2 ranked [[Howard Payne University]]. They finished #10 overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/wbasketball.xml University of Puget Sound Women's Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303234130/http://www.ups.edu/wbasketball.xml |date=2007-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Traditions and events===
In 2013 Puget Sound celebrated its 125th anniversary with a series of special events, anniversary programs, and shared memories by Loggers past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/125 |title=125th Anniversary: Celebrating University of Puget Sound |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801043114/http://www.pugetsound.edu/125/ |archive-date=2014-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating the milestone of 125 years in the community, Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland declared March 17, 2013, to be "University of Puget Sound Day." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/news-and-events/campus-news/details/1140/ |title=City of Tacoma Declares March 17, 2013 "University of Puget Sound Day" |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LogJam! is a campuswide celebration that ends the first week of fall classes. Tables are set around the perimeter of Todd Field and the Event Lawn, and clubs and teams set up to recruit potential members.

Foolish Pleasures is an annual student film festival showing films written, directed, acted, and produced by students.

[[Midnight breakfast]] is a celebration in the student union building, which occurs each semester on the last day of classes.

====The Hatchet====
The [[Hatchet]] is the official symbol of sports teams at the University of Puget Sound. It was first discovered in 1906 when students were digging up a barn at the old campus. They decided to carve their class year into it. This became a tradition of sorts, as the seniors would hand the hatchet to the juniors on senior recognition day. This turned into a competition where each class would try to possess the hatchet for as long as possible. It disappeared for 15 years until it was anonymously mailed to former President R. Franklin Thompson. Thompson displayed it in a trophy case in Jones Hall, where it mysteriously disappeared again, only to resurface at a [[homecoming]] game in 1988. In 1998, the hatchet's return was negotiated through an intermediary, and it was permanently displayed in a display case in the Wheelock Student Center. It was stolen in 1999 during a false fire alarm in one of the dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;ASUPS, [http://asups.ups.edu/welcome/history/default.aspx The Tradition of the UPS Hatchet]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2006 (homecoming) a student rappelled into the football field at halftime, brandishing "the hatchet". It was later revealed by the student newspaper ''The Trail'' that this hatchet is a replica of the actual hatchet, commissioned by the former student government administration without the knowledge of the student senate. The replica hatchet was painstakingly carved to look exactly like the original, using over 150 photos as a guide.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The original hatchet was finally returned to President Ronald Thomas in 2008 by two anonymous alumni and was displayed at Homecoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/office-of-communications/arches/archive/back-issues/arches-archive/winter-2009/the-hatchet-men/ |title=The hatchet men |author=Ron Thomas |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=Winter 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainability====
The campus has a notable recent history of [[sustainability]]. On February 10, 2005, President Ronald R. Thomas signed the [[Talloires Declaration]], committing the University to certain standards regarding sustainability. The Sustainability Advisory Committee, consisting of one faculty co-chair, one staff co-chair, and a mix of faculty, staff and student volunteers, organizes the majority of sustainability efforts on campus. These efforts have included:

*''[[Fair trade coffee]]'': The student-run Diversions Café serves only organically-grown, [[fair trade]] coffee. In 2005, {{convert|8975|lb}} of coffee was consumed by students, faculty, and the campus community. University of Puget Sound was the first college in the [[Northwest United States|Northwest]] to offer fair trade coffee exclusively.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/facts.xml P.S. Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911180522/https://www.ups.edu/facts.xml |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sustainable Move-Out'': Starting in 2005, the University organized a sustainable move-out program during finals week. Mixed-material [[recycling]] dumpsters were placed near all [[residence hall]]s, allowing students to recycle rather than simply throwing all unwanted items away.
*''Sustainability Mugs'': Upon entering the college in 2005, all students were presented with a "sustainability mug" imprinted with the UPS logo. Students were encouraged to re-use the mug to get coffee instead of using paper cups.
*''No-Waste Picnic'': A 2005 picnic welcoming incoming freshmen and their families to the campus produced a surprising ONE bag of trash for over 1700 people. This was accomplished by using recyclable paper and plastic products.

In 2007, President Thomas signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment on behalf of the university.

===Fraternities and sororities===
[[File:UPS - Sigma Chi 01.jpg|thumb|right|Sigma Chi house, University of Puget Sound]]
UPS is home to four [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] and five sororities. 20% of male students and 29% of female students are involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske Guide to Colleges 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Represented fraternities include, [[Phi Delta Theta]] (1848/1952), [[Sigma Chi]] (1855/1950), and recently reinstated [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] (1856/2010) and [[Beta Theta Pi]] (1839/2013). Represented sororities and women's fraternities include [[Pi Beta Phi]] (1867), [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] (1870), [[Alpha Phi]] (1872), [[Gamma Phi Beta]] (1874), and [[Delta Delta Delta]] (1888).
Puget Sound has a "deferred recruitment", which means that fraternities, sororities, and their members are not allowed to have any official contact with freshmen outside of class, athletics or club activities until the organized recruitment events in the first two weeks of the spring semester. Freshmen may not join a chapter until January. In the fall, chapters are permitted to give "snap bids" to upperclassmen, as well as participate in an organized fall recruitment open only to upperclassmen. A ceremony called "Crossover" took place annually on the third weekend of spring semester. Members of the Greek community partake in an entire day of celebration to honor the new members as they run across the field to their selected fraternity.

The university is one of just five independent colleges in the Northwest granted a charter by [[Phi Beta Kappa]], which claims to be the nation's most prestigious academic honor society.

Previously, several other organizations, including [[Sigma Nu]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[ Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] were represented on campus, however those chapters have all closed for a variety of reasons.

'''''Vagina dentata''''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[tooth]]ed [[vagina]]'') describes a [[folklore|folk tale]] in which a woman's vagina is said to contain teeth, with the associated implication that [[sexual intercourse]] might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. The topic of "vagina dentata" may also cover a rare medical condition affecting the vagina, in which case it is more accurately termed a ''vaginal [[dermoid cyst]]''.

==In folklore==
Such folk stories are frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage [[rape]].&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;

[[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] relays one such myth in which "a fish inhabits the vagina of the Terrible Mother; the hero is the man who overcomes the Terrible Mother, breaks the teeth out of her vagina, and so makes her into a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Erich| last=Neumann| year=1955| title=The Great Mother| page=168| location=Princeton | publisher=Princeton University Press|author2=translated by Ralph Manheim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend also appears in the mythology of the [[Chaco (tribe)|Chaco]] and [[The Guianas|Guiana]] tribes of South America. In some versions, the hero leaves one tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leach | first = Maria | title = Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend | publisher = Funk &amp; Wagnalls | location = New York | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-308-40090-9 | page = 1152 | chapter = vagina dentata | others = entry by Erminie W.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, the ''[[asura]]'' [[Andhaka]], son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] (but not aware of it), is killed by Shiva when he tries to force the disguised Shiva into surrendering Parvati. Andhaka's son Adi, also an ''asura'', takes the form of Parvati to seduce and kill Shiva with a toothed vagina in order to avenge Andhaka, but is also slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger |title=Śiva: The Erotic Ascetic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnfZ_MBErlQC&amp;pg=PA188 |accessdate=21 April 2013 |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London &amp; New York |isbn=0-19-520250-3 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ainu and Shinto legends===
The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] legend is that a sharp-toothed [[demon]] hid inside the [[vagina]] of a young woman and  [[emasculated]] two young men on their wedding nights.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/07/kanamara-matsuri-2014_n_5105892.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri 2014: What You Should Know About Japan's Penis Festival (NSFW PHOTOS)|publisher=huffingtonpost.ca|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the woman sought help from a blacksmith who fashioned an iron [[phallus]] to break the demon's teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, B.

The legendary iron phallus is considered that enshrined at the Kanayama [[Shinto]] Shrine in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Japan]], and there the popular [[Kanamara Matsuri|Festival of the Steel Phallus]] {{nihongo3|(かなまら祭り)}} is held each spring.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/_mobile/celebs/entertainment/festival-steel-phallus-japan|title=Dammit, we missed The Festival of the Steel Phallus in Japan this weekend - Cosmopolitan|publisher=cosmopolitan.co.uk|accessdate=2014-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125132/http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/_mobile/celebs/entertainment/festival-steel-phallus-japan|archive-date=2014-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/07/japan-penis-festival-kanamara-matsuri_n_5106378.html|title=Japan's Annual Penis Festival Is As Phallic As You'd Expect (PHOTOS)|author=Dominique Mosbergen|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-04-11|date=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeslive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/2014/04/10/japanese-festival-celebrates-the-penis|title=Japanese festival celebrates the penis - Times LIVE|author=Times LIVE|publisher=timeslive.co.za|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/slideshow/20140325-ten-exciting-events-not-to-miss-in-april|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331232907/http://www.bbc.com/travel/slideshow/20140325-ten-exciting-events-not-to-miss-in-april |archive-date=2014-03-31 |dead-url=yes|title=BBC - Travel - Slideshow - Ten events not to miss in April|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[prostitutes]] considered that praying at that shrine protected them against [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/04/04/kanamara-matsuri-penis-festival_n_5087119.html|title=Kanamara Matsuri: When Does Japan's Penis Festival Start?

===Māori mythology===
In [[Māori mythology]], the [[trickster]] [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]] tries to grant mankind [[immortality]] by reversing the [[birth]] process, turning into a [[worm]] and crawling into the goddess of [[night]] and [[death]] [[Hine-nui-te-pō]]'s vagina and out through her mouth while she sleeps. His trick is ruined when a [[pīwakawaka]] laughs at the sight of his entry, awakening Hine-nui-te-pō, who bites him to death with her [[obsidian]] vaginal teeth.

==Metaphorical usage==
In her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1991), [[Camille Paglia]] wrote:
:The toothed vagina is no sexist hallucination: every penis is made less in every vagina, just as mankind, male and female, is devoured by mother nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Paglia|Paglia, Camille]] (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]]''. NY: Vintage. p. 47. {{ISBN|9780679735793}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Wimp Factor'', Stephen J. Ducat expresses a similar view, that these myths express the threat sexual intercourse poses for men who, although entering triumphantly, always leave diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Medical==
In rare instances, [[dermoid cyst]]s (a type of tumor) may grow in the vagina. Dermoid cysts are formed from the outer layers of embryonic skin cells. These cells are able to mature into many different types of tissues, and these cysts are able to form anywhere the skin is or where the skin folds inwards to become another organ, such as in the ear or the vagina. However, when dermoid cysts occur in the vagina, they are covered by a layer of normal vaginal tissue and therefore appear as a lump, not as recognizable teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is vaginal dermoid cyst a rare occurrence or a misnomer?

'''Vincenzo Mirabella Alagona''' ([[Syracuse, Sicily]] 1570 - [[Modica]], 1624) was an Italian historian, archaeologist and architect, best known for his work ''Plans of Ancient Syracuse''.

== Family life==
Vincenzo Mirabella, son of Michele Mirabella and Giovanna Alagona,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; was born into a patrician family of French origin which had moved to Sicily in the early fourteenth century. As a young man he dedicated himself to the study of Greek, Latin and Italian literature as well as mathematics, music, history and poetry. He played an active part in civic life, holding office as ''magister nundinarum'' (Master of the Assizes) in 1593, Treasurer of the University in 1613-14 and Jurat, the highest office in the city, in 1616-17.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inc-cin.org/assets/pdf/articles/numismates-mirabella.pdf accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lucrezia Platamone, daughter of Antonio and Giovanna Zumbo, who brought him a substantial dowry and further connections to the leading families of Syracuse. He does not appear to have had any children with her.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in a house in Syracuse in front of the [[Church of St. Thomas in the Pantheon]], in a street which bears his name today.

==Architecture and building==
On a number of occasions he contributed to the development of Syracuse: in 1608 he was involved in the expansion of the cathedral square as representative of the church attorneys; he planned the [[Theatine]] Church of San Andrea built in 1610;{{efn|group=note|[http://www.antoniorandazzo.it/chiese%20demolite/sant-andrea-teatini.html San Andrea dei Teatini]}} in 1620 he provided technical advice to the Senate of Syracuse about the construction of a stone bridge over the [[Anapo]] to connect the city with Modica. From the early 1620s he moved to Modica to direct the building works for [[Santa Maria delle Grazie]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inc-cin.org/assets/pdf/articles/numismates-mirabella.pdf accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|group=note|[http://www.santuariomadonnadellegrazie.net/ Website of the Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie]}} Of his work on this building, only the western doorway remains, decorated with a fragmentary [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] supported by two columns mounted on high pedestals and crowned with a decorated arch with an intricate design.

==Literary and historical works==
He published his first book, a collection of [[madrigal]]s, in 1604. In recognition of his earlier works he was enrolled in the [[Accademia degli Oziosi]] in [[Naples]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1614 he became the first Sicilian to become a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siracusaweb.com/main/siracusa/personaggi/vincenzo-mirabella.html accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; (his membership was proposed by [[Giambattista della Porta]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006436&amp;searchAssoc=Assoc accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; where he met [[Galileo Galilei]], with whom he corresponded.{{efn|group=note|[http://colombo.imss.fi.it/IMSS/?q=author:%22Mirabella%2C%20Vincenzo%2C%201570-1624.%22 ] | Letter from Vincenzo Mirabella to Galileo Galilei (7 July 1614) }}{{efn|group=note|[http://colombo.imss.fi.it/IMSS/?q=author:%22Mirabella%2C%20Vincenzo%2C%201570-1624.%22 ] | Letter from Vincenzo Mirabella to Galileo Galilei (19 August 1614) }} Passionate about the country's history and archaeology, he wrote a ''History of Syracuse'', but did not manage to have it published, and the manuscript was eventually lost.

[[File: Michelangelo Caravaggio 010.jpg|thumb|right|Caravaggio's 'Burial of St. Lucy']]
From October to December 1608 he accompanied the painter [[Caravaggio]] on visits to the archaeological remains of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].  On a trip with him to a disused quarry, Caravaggio coined the name '[[Ear of Dionysius]]' for it and later used it as a setting for his famous work the '[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St.Lucy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Warwick (ed.), Caravaggio: Realism, Rebellion, Reception, University of Delaware Press, 2006 p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casa di Vincenzo Mirabella 1.jpg|thumb|The interior of Mirabella's house]]
Vincenzo Mirabella assembled the objects he excavated into a diverse archaeological collection, which he exhibited in the rooms of his palace in Ortygia, at the current Via Mirabella nº23, which he steadily transformed into his own museum. At his death, his heirs donated parts of this collection to the Museu Patrio of Syracuse, which later became the [[Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi]].

==Description of the Plan of Ancient Syracuse==
His most important work, and the only one still extant today, was published in Naples in 1613 in Naples  - '' 'La dichiarazione della pianta delle antiche Siracuse e di alcune scelte medaglie di esse e dei principi che quelle possedettero' '' ''('Description of the plan of ancient Syracuse and of selected medals of that place and of the characteristics they possessed')''.{{efn|group=note|[https://archive.org/details/dichiarazionidel00mira Digital edition of 'La dichiarazione della pianta delle antiche Siracuse']}} The work was dedicated to [[Philip III of Spain]], who ruled Sicily at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ragusanews.com/articolo/48165/moriva-a-modica-390-anni-fa-vincenzo-mirabella-nobiluomo-siciliano accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The text was accompanied by a topographic plan of Syracuse, divided into nine panels,{{efn|group=note|[http://www.antoniorandazzo.it/siracusani/mirabella-due.html maps and illustrations from 'Description of the plan of ancient Syracuse']}} which bore a detailed hypothetical description of the city from [[Ortygia]] to the [[Euryalus fortress]], and from the source of the river [[Ciane]] to the house of [[Archimedes]], with a gazetteer of places of historical and archaeological interest. It was supplemented with biographies of Archimedes, [[Theocritus]], [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and [[Tisias]].  This work was the fruit of his studies of classical authors - [[Thucydides]], [[Plutarch]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Cicero]], [[Livy]], [[Strabo]] and [[Pomponius Mela]], as well as of the archaeological endeavours he undertook at his own expense. He was also the first to excavate the [[catacombs]] of Syracuse, which he illustrated in a panel of his book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The first (1613) edition of ''Pianta delle antiche Siracuse'' was quickly sold out. It was reprinted in [[Palermo]] in 1717 with the title ''Descrizione delle quattro città dell'Antica Siracusa'', edited by Giovan Battista Aiccardo. Another edition of the map, recently rediscovered, is in the ''Thesaurus Antiquitatum et Historiarum Siciliae'' of Giovanni Giorgio Graevio, edited by Vander Aa in 1725 in ''Lugduni Batavorum'' ([[Leiden]]). There is also a 1989 edition, ''Pianta delle Antiche Siracuse'', edited by Cesare Samà and published by Arnoldo Lombardi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siracusaweb.com/main/siracusa/personaggi/vincenzo-mirabella.html accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and memorial==
Vincenzo Mirabella died of the plague in Modica in 1624.  He was buried in the church of the Madonna delle Grazie, with this epitaph on his tomb:

{{Citazione|''“D.O.M. - D. Vincentius Mirabella et Alagona, patritius syracusanus, studio vetustatis, liberalium artium peritia ac splendore virtutum vir insignis, ubique clarissimus, et inter Linceos honorifice cooptatus, qui antiquam Patriae glorian e tenebris erutam ac luci restitutam, cum sui nominis laude posteritati fecit immortalem. Motycae decedens post Deiparae Virginis festum, cujus ergo advenerat, in eius templo, cura sua praecipue olim extructo, mortalitatis exuvias deposuit. Anno Domini 1624, aetatis suae 54.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ragusanews.com/articolo/48165/moriva-a-modica-390-anni-fa-vincenzo-mirabella-nobiluomo-siciliano accessed 12/7/2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Citazione|''Don Vincenzo Mirabella e Alagona, patrician of Syracuse, student of antiquity, expert in the liberal arts, man of signal virtues and splendour, most renowned in every place, Linceian Academician, who restored from darkness to light the ancient glory of his homeland, rendering it immortal.
