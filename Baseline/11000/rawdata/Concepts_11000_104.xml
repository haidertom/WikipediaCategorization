'''''Abatement ab initio''''' is a [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] that states that the death of a defendant who is appealing a criminal [[conviction]] [[Vacated judgment|vacates]] the conviction.  Abatement ab initio was the subject of two [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions, [[Durham v. United States (1971)|Durham v. United States]] (1971) and [[Dove v. United States]] (1976). The former extended the doctrine to cases where [[certiorari]] was pending and not yet granted, and the latter excluded [[discretionary appeal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/21760-abatement-ab-initio-and-a-crime-victims-right-to Abatement AB Initio and a Crime Victim’s Right to Restitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abatement ab initio was used to overturn the convictions of [[John Salvi]], [[Kenneth Lay]], and [[Aaron Hernandez]].

'''''Ajātivāda''''' is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the [[Brahman|Absolute]] is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|unreal]], and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'',{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} applying the philosophical concept of "ajāta" to the inquiry of Brahman,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} showing that Brahman wholly transcends the conventional understanding of being and becoming. The concept is also found in Madhyamaka Buddhism, as the theory of nonorigination.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Ajātivāda:
* "A" means "not", or "non" as in Ahimsa, non-harm
* "Jāti" means "creation" or "origination{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}
* "Vāda" means "doctrine"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Taken together "ajātivāda" means "the Doctrine of no-origination"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} or non-creation.

The concept of "ajāta" was borrowed by Gaudapada from Madhyamika Buddhism,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term [[Anutpada|"anutpāda"]]:{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" also means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Gaudapada===
{{See also|Prajnaparamita}}

"Ajātivāda" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada borrowed the concept of "ajāta" from Nagajurna's  Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are [[Śūnyatā|without self-substance]]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}} Another well-known use is in [[Bankei Yōtaku|Bankei's]] "Unborn".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=316}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} In the ''Mandukya Karika'', Gaudapada's commentary on the ''Mandukya Upanishad'', Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===Ramana Maharshi===
{{Main|Ramana Maharshi}}

Ramana Maharshi gave a translation in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] of Gaudapada’s ''Mandukya Upanishad Karika'', chapter two, verse thirty-two:
{{quote|There is no creation, no destruction, no bondage, no longing to be freed from bondage, no striving to be free [from bondage], nor anyone who has attained [freedom from bondage]. Know that this is the ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/08/ajata.html David Godman, ''Ajata'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|David Godman: "This rendering appears as ‘Stray verse nine’ in Collected Works and as ‘Bhagavan 28’ in Guru Vachaka Kovai. Variations of this verse can also be found in the [[Amritabindu Upanishad]] (verse 10), Atma Upanishad (verse 30) and Vivekachudamani (verse 574)."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;}}}}

According to David Godman, the ajata doctrine implies that since the world was never created, there are also no [[jiva]]s within it who are striving for or attaining liberation. Ramana Maharshi regarded this as "the ultimate truth."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;

==Levels of truth==
{{See also|Two truths doctrine|Trikaya|Essence-Function}}

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} namely ''saṃvṛti-satya'', "the empirical truth",&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520880/samvrti-satya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''saṃvṛti-satya'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramārtha-satya'', "ultimate truth".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti" /&gt; According to Plott, 
{{quote|"Ajativada is nothing but [an] extreme and exhaustive application of an extreme version of the distinction between the paramartha satya and the samvrtti satya."{{sfn|Plott|1980|p=283}}}}

The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully expressed by the [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka-school]]. In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' it is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=296, 298, verse 24:8-10}}}}

Shankara uses [[Advaita Vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
# {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
# {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

It is at the level of the highest truth (''paramārtha'') that there is no origination.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} Gaudapada states that, from the absolute standpoint, not even "non-dual" exists.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

==Advaita Vedanta and Madhyamaka Buddhism==
Many scholars, states Richard King, designate Madhyamaka Buddhism as ''Ajativada''.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}} The concept ''Ajati'', he adds, exists in both Vedanta and Buddhism, but they are different in the following way:
{{quote|1. [[Anutpada|"There is no birth."]] (Madhyamaka), and
2. "There is an [[Brahman|Unborn]]." (Advaita Vedānta.){{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}}}

Ajativada in Madhyamaka refers to its doctrine that things neither originate nor is there cessation.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}} This is also called the theory of non-origination of Madhyamaka.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anyonyābhāva''', is one of the four [[Abhāva]]s. According to [[Acharya Samant Bhadra]], as related in [[Aptamimansa]], the absence (non-existence) of the present modification of one particular matter [[Matter|substance]] in the present modification of any other matter substance is called ''Anyonyābhāva'', e.g. the present bitter taste of [[lemon]] is not present in the present sweetness of [[sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;The Four Abhāvas http://www.jainworld.com/education/tatvagyan1/lesson07.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ascribed characteristics''', as used in the [[social sciences]], refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|last=Ferrante|first=Joan|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|publisher=Cenage|year=|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by "nature" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by "nurture" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), See: [[Nature versus nurture|Nature versus Nurture]].

== Use Within Demography ==

Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different than another by the creation of a country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel|title=Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows Demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of [[Race (human categorization)|Race]], [[Gender]] and [[Ethnicity]]. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are [[Social construction of gender|Social Constructs]], '''ASCRIBED''' to groups or individuals for Stratification &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs|title=Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender roles : a sociological perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda|isbn=9780205899685|edition=Sixth|location=Boston|oclc=892213147|date = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With these [[Theory|theories]] in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products weather perceived or not. Discussed below are Race, Gender, [[Social status|Social Status]] / [[Caste]] and Hiring / Promotion.

=== Race ===
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of [[racism]] can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse and Discrimination: Rhetorics Of Racism and Antisemitism|last=Resigl|first=Martin|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Race does not entirely have a 

=== Gender ===
[https://www.uu.nl/staff/fvantubergen/0 Frank van Tubergen] studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics effect their [[Social capital|Social Capital]] in the article ''Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Tubergen|first=Frank|last2=Al-Modaf|first2=Obaid Ali|last3=Almosaed|first3=Nora F.|last4=Al-Ghamdi|first4=Mohammed Ben Said|title=Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics|journal=Social Networks|volume=45|pages=45–54|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2015.10.007|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in [[Saudi Arabia]] citing specifically that it was "due to fewer non-family connections". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find [[homosexuality]] morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Q|last2=Wilson|first2=G.D|year=2003|title=Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio: evidence for organising effects of sex hormones or developmental instability?|url=|journal=International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=28|pages=288–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sexual orientation]].). Both Groups do however use the term all the same, simply '''ascribing''' different definitions to those individuals.

=== Social Status / Caste ===
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is [[India]], and its [[Caste system in India|Caste System]]. In its essence, it was a system that ascribed sweepers the lowest status, making this one group literally untouchable. Although India officially states that discrimination against lower castes is illegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf][http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf CRIME AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO SCs / STs]'''Government of India, National Crime Records Bureau''' (2011), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Hiring / Promotion ===

[[Ronald P. Dore]] was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese Economy. His view will be expressed here. In his largest work, ''British Factory, Japanese Factory''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British factory, Japanese factory : the origins of national diversity in industrial relations|last=Dore|first=Ronald|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024953|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=20130326}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion, in the Japanese firm Hitachi, over a particular time were based chiefly on "achievement" or chiefly on "ascribed characteristics". The context of the discussion implied that achievement-based decisions are good, while those based on ascribed characteristics are bad. His discussion admits explicitly and, implicitly, that there are several complications to moral judgement that include:

* Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strenze|first=Tarmo|date=2007-09-01|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606001127|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "the power to command...may be much more likely to be bred in upper class families" to the extent that "the power to command" is viewed as a measure of merit. Promotion decisions favoring high merit would not be entirely distinguishable from making promotion decisions favoring high class thus, it can be difficult, to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons.
* It is possible to, "irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics", or even do so intentionally. For example, by converting to a new religion or getting married. 
* It is reasonable to view even some ascribed characteristics as factors that should affect employee compensation. In Hitachi, for example, pay is positively correlated both with performance and with age. The latter is an ascribed characteristic, but Dore suggests that it is a perfectly reasonable consideration, especially since expenses such as childcare, tend to increase over the duration of employment at Hitachi.

Dore also points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards, he viewed an applicant's success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. Thus, he noted that hiring decisions at Hitachi, during the time of his study, were "regulated by very strict qualification standards" and not very significantly influenced by ascribed characteristics. When he turned to evaluate opportunities for advancement within the firm, however, Dore noted that "educational qualifications...limit the range of posts which one can achieve". Meaning even if one's level of achievement increases, one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. Therefore, in investigating opportunities for promotions, educational achievement " the two become another form of ascribed characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hearn|first=James C.|title=Attendance at higher-cost colleges: Ascribed, socioeconomic, and academic influences on student enrollment patterns|journal=Economics of Education Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–76|doi=10.1016/0272-7757(88)90072-6|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications.

'''Asha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʃ|ə}}; also '''arta''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ə}}; [[Avestan language|Avestan]]:''𐬀𐬴𐬀‎‎'' ''aṣ̌a/arta'') is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept with a complex and highly nuanced range of meaning. It is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of 'truth' and 'right(eousness)', 'order' and 'right working'.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_27"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1961_34ff"&gt;{{harvnb|Zaehner|1961|pp=34ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For other connotations, see [[#Meaning|meaning]] below. It is of cardinal importance&lt;ref name="DG_1963_46"&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to Zoroastrian theology and doctrine. In the moral sphere, ''aša/arta'' represents what has been called "the decisive confessional concept of Zoroastrianism".&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_cit_Lommel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lommel|1930|p=48}} qtd. in&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{harvnb|Boyce|1987|p=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of Avestan ''aša'' is ''𐬛𐬭𐬎𐬘‎ druj'', "deceit, falsehood".

Its [[Old Persian]] equivalent is ''arta-''.{{Ref_label|OP_Arta|c|none}} In [[Middle Iranian languages]] the term appears as ''ard-''.{{Ref_label|MI_Ard|a|none}}

The word is also the proper name of the divinity '''Asha''', the [[Amesha Spenta]] that is the [[hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] or "genius"&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_323"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of "Truth" or "Righteousness". In the [[Younger Avesta]], this figure is more commonly referred to as '''Asha Vahishta''' (''Aša Vahišta'', ''Arta Vahišta''), "Best Truth".{{Ref_label|Best_Possession|b|none}} The [[Middle Persian]] descendant is ''Ashawahist'' or ''Ardwahisht''; [[New Persian]] ''Ardibehesht'' or ''Ordibehesht''. In the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by the prophet himself, it is seldom possible to distinguish between moral principle and the divinity. Later texts consistently use the 'Best' epithet when speaking of the Amesha Spenta, only once in the Gathas is 'best' an adjective of ''aša/arta''.

==Etymology==
Avestan ''{{lang|ae|aša}}'' and its [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] equivalent ''[[rta|{{IAST|ṛtá}}]]'' both derive from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*ṛtá-'' "truth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asa-means-truth-in-avestan |title=AṦA (Asha "Truth") – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn continues [[PIE|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*{{PIE|h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;r-to-}}'' "properly joined, right, true", from the root ''*{{PIE|h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ar}}''.
The word is attested in [[Old Persian]] as ''{{lang|peo-Latn|arta}}''.

It is unclear whether the [[Avestan phonology#sh-rt|Avestan variation between ''aša'' and ''arta'']] is merely orthographical. Benveniste suggested ''š'' was only a convenient way of writing ''rt'' and should not be considered phonetically relevant.&lt;ref name="Miller_1968_274"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1968|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gray, ''š'' is a misreading, representing – not /ʃ/ - but /rr/, of uncertain phonetic value but "probably" representing a [[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]] ''r''.&lt;ref name="Grey_1941_102_103"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1941|pp=102–103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller suggested that ''rt'' was restored when a scribe was aware of the [[morpheme]] boundary between the /r/ and /t/ (that is, whether the writer maintained the ''–ta'' suffix).&lt;ref name="Miller_1968_275"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1968|p=274,275}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|Miller_note|h|none}}

Avestan ''druj'', like its Vedic Sanskrit cousin ''druh'', appears to derive from the PIE root ''*{{PIE|dhreugh}}'', also continued in Persian دروغ / ''d[o]rūġ'' "lie", German ''Trug'' "fraud, deception". Old Norse ''draugr'' and Middle Irish ''airddrach'' mean "spectre, spook". The Sanskrit cognate ''druh'' means "affliction, afflicting demon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=druj-|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/druj|publisher=ENCYCLOPÆDIA IRANICA|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Avestan, '' druj-'' has a secondary derivation, the adjective ''drəguuaṇt-'' (Later Avestan '' druuaṇt-''), "partisan of deception, deceiver" for which the superlative ''draojišta-'' and perhaps the comparative ''draoj(ii)ah-'' are attested (Kellens, 2010, pp. 69 ff.).

==Meaning==
''Aša'' "cannot be precisely rendered by some single word in another tongue" &lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_27"/&gt; but may be summarized as follows:

It is, first of all, 'true statement'. This 'true statement', because it is true, corresponds to an objective, material reality that embraces all of existence. Recognized in it is a great cosmic principle since all things happen according to it.&lt;ref name="DG_1963_47"&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|DG_original|j|none}} 
"This cosmic [...] force is imbued also with morality, as verbal Truth, 'la parole conforme', and Righteousness, action conforming with the moral order."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1970_29"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1970|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correspondence between 'truth', reality and an all-encompassing cosmic principle is not far removed from [[Heraclitus|Heraclitus']] conception of [[Logos]].&lt;ref name="DG_1963_48_49"&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|pp=48–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As "truth"===
Both Avestan ''aša/arta'' and Vedic ''ŗtá-'' are commonly translated as "truth" as this best reflects both the original meaning of the term as well as the opposition to their respective antonyms. The opposite of Avestan ''aša/arta'' is ''druj-'', "lie." Similarly, the opposites of Vedic ''{{IAST|ṛtá-}}'' are ''{{IAST|ánṛta-}}'' and ''druh'', likewise "lie".

That "truth" is also what was commonly understood by the term as attested in Greek myth of: ''Isis and Osiris'' 47, [[Plutarch]] calls the divinity Αλήθεια  ''[[Aletheia]]'', "Truth."&lt;ref name="Plutarch_47"&gt;{{harvnb|Babbitt|1936|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As "existence"===
The adjective corresponding to the noun ''aša/arta'', "truth", is Avestan ''haithya-'' (''haiθiia-''), "true", the opposite of which is also ''druj-''. Avestan ''haithya-'' derives from Indo-Iranian ''*sātya'' that in turn derives from Indo-European ''*sat-'' "being, existing". The Sanskrit cognate ''sátya-'' means "true" in the sense of "really existing." This meaning is also preserved in Avestan, for instance in the expression ''haiθīm var''ə''z'', "to make true" as in "to bring to realization."&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1987_695"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1987|p=695.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning of "reality" may be inferred from the component parts of the ''aša/arta'': from (root) ''ŗ'' with a [[substantive|substantivizing]] ''-ta'' suffix. The root ''ŗ'' corresponds to Old Avestan ''ar''ə''ta-'' and Younger Avestan ə''r''ə''ta-'' "established", hence ''aša/arta'' "that which is established."&lt;ref name="Miller_1968_274"/&gt;

The synonymy of ''aša'' and "existence" overlaps with the stock identification of Ahura Mazda as the creator (of existence itself). Truth is existence (creation) inasmuch as falsehood is non-existence (uncreated, anti-created). Also, because ''aša'' is everything that ''druj-'' is not (or vice versa), since ''aša'' is, ''druj-'' is not. Details are have  [[Angra Mainyu#In Zoroastrian tradition|Angra Mainyu]].

This notion is already expressed in the Avesta itself, such as in the first ''Yasht'', dedicated to Ahura Mazda, in which the "fifth name is the whole good existence of Mazda, the seed of Asha" (&lt;!-- ''pukhdha vispa vohu Mazdadhata asha-chithra''--&gt; ''Yasht'' 1.7). Similarly, in the mythology of ''Gandar''ə''βa'', the 'yellow-heeled' dragon of the ''druj-'' that emerges from the deep to destroy the "living world (creation) of Aša" (&lt;!-- merekhshano gaetha astvaitish ashahe --&gt;''Yasht'' 19.41)

In the ethical goals of Zoroastrianism ("good thoughts, good words, good deeds"), Vohu Manah is active in good thoughts, Sraosha in good words and Aša in good deeds. (''Denkard'' 3.13-14). Aša is thus "represented as active and effective."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_390"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1987|p=390}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As "right working"===
Subject to context, ''aša/arta-'' is also frequently translated as "right working" or "[that which is] right". The word then (''cf.'' Bartholomae's&lt;ref name="Bartholomae_1904_229_259"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartholomae|1904}}, coll. 229-259.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Friedrich Geldner|Geldner]]'s&lt;ref name="Geldner_1908_1ff"&gt;{{harvnb|Geldner|1908|p=1ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; translations as German language "''Recht''") has the same range of meaning of "right" as in the English language: truth, righteousness, rightfulness, lawfullness, conformity, accord, order (cosmic order, social order, moral order). &lt;!-- Bartholomae, p. 96: "1) Gesetz, Recht, heiliges Recht 2) was das Gesetz (usw.) verlangt, religiöse Pflicht." --&gt;

These various meanings of "right" are frequently combined, such as "the inexorable law of righteousness,"&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_510"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=510}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or as "the eternal fitness of things that are in accord with the divine order."&lt;ref name="WilliamsJackson_1913_200"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams Jackson|1913|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As (the hypostasis of) regularity and "right working", ''aša/arta-'' is present when Ahura Mazda fixed the course of the sun, the moon and the stars (''Yasna'' 44.3), and it is through ''aša'' that plants grow (''Yasna'' 48.6).

"Right working" also overlaps with both Indo-European ''*ár-'' "to (properly) join together" and with the notion of existence and realization (to make real). The word for "established", ''ar''ə''ta-'', also means "proper". The antonymic ''anar''ə''ta-'' (or ''anar''ə''θa-'') means "improper''&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_165"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Zoroastrian tradition, prayers must be enunciated with care for them to be effective. The Indo-Iranian formula ''*sātyas mantras'' (''Yasna'' 31.6: ''haiθīm mathrem'') "does not simply mean 'true Word' but formulated thought which is in conformity with the reality' or 'poetic (religious) formula with inherent fulfillment (realization)'".&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1987_695"/&gt;

It perhaps has also suggestions of harmoniousness or cooperativeness

===In comparison to Vedic usage===
The kinship&lt;ref name="Duchesne-Guillemin_1963_43_47"&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|pp=43–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; between Old Iranian ''aša-/arta-'' and Vedic ''ŗtá-'' is evident in numerous formulaic phrases and expressions that appear in both the [[Avesta]] and in the [[RigVeda]].&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1987_cit_Schlerath_1968"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1987|p=694}} cit.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{harvnb|Schlerath|1968|pp=168–182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the ''*ŗtásya path-'', "path of truth", is attested multiple times in both sources: Y 51.13, 72.11; RV 3.12.7, 7.66.3. Similarly "source of truth," Avestan ''aša khá'' and Vedic ''{{IAST|khâm ṛtásya}}'' (Y 10.4; RV 2.28.5)

The adjective corresponding to Avestan ''aša/arta-'' is ''haiθiia-'' "true". Similarly, the adjective corresponding to Vedic ''ŗtá-'' "truth" is ''sátya-'' "true". &lt;!-- do more? eg Its forms areta, 'proper,' and anareta or anaretha, 'improper,' are likewise found.50 --&gt; The opposite of both ''aša/arta-'' and ''haithya-'' is ''druj-'' "lie" or "false". In contrast, in the Vedas the opposite of both ''ŗtá-'' and ''sátya-'' is ''druj-'' and ''ánŗta-'', also "lie" or "false".

However, while the Indo-Iranian concept of truth is attested throughout Zoroastrian tradition, ''ŗtá-'' disappears in post-Vedic literature and is not preserved in post-Vedic texts. On the other hand, ''sátya-'' and ''ánrta-'' both survive in classical Sanskrit.

The main theme of the Rig Veda, "the truth and the gods", is not evident in the Gathas.&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1987_694"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1987|p=694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic parallels between ''aša/arta'' and ''ŗtá-'', however, exist such aa in ''Yasht'' 10, the Avestan hymn to [[Mithra]]. There, Mithra, who is the hypostasis and the preserver of covenant, is the protector of ''aša/arta''.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_186"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- disgusting Nybergianisms:&lt;ref name="Widengren_1965_15"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1965|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt; RigVedic [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] is likewise preserver of ''ŗtá-''.&lt;!-- RV 3.59 --&gt;

==Fire as the agent of Truth==
Asha Vahishta is closely associated with [[fire worship|fire]]. Fire is "grandly conceived as a force informing all the ''other'' [[Amesha Spentas]], giving them warmth and the spark of life."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_389"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1987|p=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Yasht'' 17.20, [[Angra Mainyu]] clamours that Zoroaster burns him with Asha Vahishta. In ''Vendidad'' 4.54-55, speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is detected by the consumption of "water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt."

This analogy of truth that burns and detecting truth through fire is already attested in the very earliest texts, that is, in the Gathas and in the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]''. In ''Yasna'' 43-44, Ahura Mazda dispenses justice through radiance of His fire and the strength of aša. Fire "detects" sinners "by hand-grasping" (''Yasna'' 34.4). An individual who has passed the fiery test (''garmo-varah'', [[trial by ordeal|ordeal by heat]]), has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (''Yasna'' 30.7). Altogether, "there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1989_1"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1989|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the post-Sassanid ''Dadestan i denig'' (I.31.10), at the final judgement a river of molten metal will cover the earth. The righteous, as they wade through this river, will perceive the molten metal as a bath of warm milk. The wicked will be scorched. For details on aša's role in personal and final judgement, see [[#In eschatology and sotereology|''aša'' in eschatology]], below.

Fire is moreover the "auxiliary of the truth," "and not only, as in the ordeal, of justice and of truth at the same time."&lt;ref name="DG_1963_47"/&gt; In ''Yasna'' 31.19, "the man who thinks of ''aša'', [...] who uses his tongue in order to speak correctly, [does so] with the aid of brilliant fire". In ''Yasna'' 34-44 devotees "ardently desire [Mazda's] mighty fire, through aša." In ''Yasna'' 43-44, Ahura Mazda "shall come to [Zoroaster] through the splendour of [Mazda's] fire, possessing the strength of (through) aša and good mind (=Vohu Manah)." That fire "possesses strength through ''aša''"&lt;!--''aša-ahojah'', Gray--&gt; is repeated again in ''Yasna'' 43.4. In ''Yasna'' 43.9, Zoroaster, wishing to serve fire, gives his attention to ''aša''. In ''Yasna'' 37.1, in a list of what are otherwise all physical creations, ''aša'' takes the place of fire.

Asha Vahishta's association with ''atar'' is carried forward in the post-Gathic texts, and they are often mentioned together. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, each of the Amesha Spentas represents one aspect of creation and one of seven primordial elements that in Zoroastrian tradition are the basis of that creation. In this matrix, ''aša/arta'' is the origin of fire, Avestan ''[[atar]]'', which permeates through all Creation. The correspondence then is that ''aša/arta'' "penetrates all ethical life, as fire penetrates all physical being."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1970_29"/&gt; &lt;!-- Though only fully developed in the Pahlavi texts, this cosmogonical identification is already alluded to in both the Gathic and younger Avestan texts. --&gt;

In the liturgy Asha Vahishta is frequently invoked together with fire. (''Yasna'' l.4, 2.4, 3.6, 4.9, 6.3, 7.6, 17.3, 22.6, 59.3, 62.3&lt;!-- , Nyashes 5.9 --&gt; etc.). In one passage, fire is a protector of ''aša'': "when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened" (''Yasht'' 13.77)

In later Zoroastrian tradition, Asha Vahishta is still at times identified with the fire of the household hearth.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_170"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In eschatology and soteriology==
In addition to the role of fire [[#Fire as the agent of Truth|as the agent of Truth]], fire, among its various other manifestations, is also "the fire of judicial ordeal, prototype of the fiery torrent of judgement day, when all will receive their just deserts 'by fire and by Aša' (''Y'' 31.3)."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_389"/&gt;

In the Avesta, the "radiant quarters" of ''aša'' is "the best existence", i.e. Paradise (cf. ''Vendidad'' 19.36), entry to which is restricted to those who are recognized as "possessing truth" (''[[ashavan|ašavan]]'').&lt;ref name="Gershevitch_1945_483"&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1955|p=483}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to this doctrine is ''Yasna'' 16.7: "We worship the radiant quarters of ''Aša'' in which dwell the souls of the dead, the [[Fravashi|Fravašis]] of the ''ašavan''s; the best existence (=Paradise) of the ''ašavan''s we worship, (which is) light and according all comforts."&lt;ref name="Gershevitch_1945_483"/&gt;

'Aša' derives from the same Proto-Indo-European root as '[[Airyaman]]', the divinity of healing who is closely associated with Asha Vahishta. At the last judgement, the common noun ''airyaman'' is an epithet of the ''[[saoshyant|saoshyans]]'', the saviours that bring about the final renovation of the world. The standing epithet of these saviour figures is &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''astvat''ә''r''ә''ta''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which likewise has ''arta'' as an element of the name.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_165"/&gt; These saviours are those who follow Ahura Mazda's teaching "with acts inspired by aša" (''Yasna'' 48.12). Both Airyaman and Asha Vahishta (as also Atar) are closely associated with [[Sraosha]] "[Voice of] Conscience" and guardian of the [[Chinvat bridge]] across which souls must pass.

According to a lost Avestan passage that is only preserved in a later (9th century) Pahlavi text, towards the end of time and the final renovation, Aša and Airyaman will together come upon the earth to do battle with the Az,&lt;!-- to be confused with Azi=snake --&gt; the demon of greed (''Zatspram'' 34.38-39).

The third ''Yasht'', which is nominally addressed to Asha Vahishta, is in fact mostly devoted to the praise of the ''[[airyaman ishya]]'' (''airy''ә''mā īšyo'', "Longed-for ''airyaman''"), the fourth of the four great Gathic prayers. In present-day Zoroastrianism it is considered to invoke Airyaman just as the ''[[Ashem Vohu]]'', is the second of the four great Gathic prayers, is dedicated to Aša. All four prayers (the first is the [[Ahuna Vairya]], the third is the Yenghe Hatam) have judgement and/or salvation as a theme, and all four call on the Truth.

It is Airyaman that – together with fire – will "melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river" (''Bundahishn'' 34.18). In Zoroastrian tradition, metal is the domain of Xshathra [Vairya], the Amesha Spenta of "[Desirable] Dominion", with whom Aša is again frequently identified. Dominion is moreover "a form of truth and results from truth."&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1987_696"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1987|p=696}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Denkard'' 8.37.13, Asha Vahishta actually takes over Airyaman's healer role as the healer of all spiritual ills and Airyaman then only retains the role of healer of corporeal ills. Although Airyaman has no dedication in the Siroza, the invocations to the divinities of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], Airyaman is twice invoked together with Aša. (''Siroza'' 1.3 and 2.3)

''Aogemadaecha'' 41-47 prototypes death as a journey that has to be properly prepared for: As mortals acquires material goods as they go through life, so also should they furnish themselves with spiritual stores of righteousness. They will then be well provisioned when they embark on the journey from which they will not return.

Aša's role is not limited to judgement: In ''Bundahishn'' 26.35, Aša prevents demons from exacting too great a punishment to souls consigned to hell. Here, Aša occupies the position that other texts assign to [[Mithra]], who is traditionally identified with fairness.

For the relationship between Aša, eschatology and [[Nowruz]], see [[#In the Zoroastrian calendar|in the Zoroastrian calendar]], below.

Although there are numerous eschatological parallels between Aša and [[Ashi|Aši]] "recompense, reward" (most notably their respective associations with Sraosha and Vohu Manah), and are on occasion even mentioned together (''Yasna'' 51.10), the two are not etymologically related. The feminine abstract noun ''aši/arti'' derives from ''ar-'', "to allot, to grant." Aši also has no Vedic equivalent.

==In relationship to the other Amesha Spentas==
In Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology, which—though alluded to in the Gathas—is only systematically described in Zoroastrian tradition (e.g. ''Bundahishn'' 3.12), ''aša'' is the second (cf. ''Yasna'' 47.1) of the six primeval creations realized ("created by His thought") by Ahura Mazda. It is through these six, the [[Amesha Spenta]]s that all subsequent creation was accomplished.

In addition to Asha Vahishta's role as an Amesha Spenta and hence one of the primordial creations through which all other creation was realized, Truth is one of the "organs, aspects or emanations" of Ahura Mazda through which the Creator acts and is immanent in the world.&lt;ref name="Gershevitch_1964_12"&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1964|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Vohu Manah regularly stands first in the list of the Amesha Spenta (and of Ahura Mazda's creations), in the Gathas Asha Vahishta is the most evident of the six, and also the most commonly associated with Wisdom (Mazda). In the 238 verses of these hymns, Aša appears 157 times. Of the other concepts, only ''[[Vohu Manah]]'' "Good Purpose" appears nearly as often (136 occurrences). In comparison, the remaining four of the great sextet appear only 121 times altogether.

Although a formal hierarchy is not evident in the Gathas, the group of six "divides naturally into three [[dyad (sociology)|dyads]]."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_389"/&gt; In this arrangement, Aša is paired with Vohu Manah. This reflects the frequency in which the two appear (together) in the Gathas and is in turn reflected in Zoroastrian tradition. In ''Bundahishn'' 26.8, Vohu Manah stands at the left hand of God, while Aša stands at the right.

==In divine epithets==

===Of Ahura Mazda===
Yasht 1, the hymn dedicated to Ahura Mazda, provides a list of 74 "names" by which the Creator is invoked.{{Ref_label|Darmesteter_Yt1|f|none}} In the numbered list of ''Yasht'' 1.7, 'Asha Vahishta' "Best Truth" is the fourth name.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_166"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also Gray:102 --&gt; A later verse, ''Yasht'' 1.12, includes 'Ašavan'&lt;ref name="Gray_1926_101"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1926|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Possessing Truth" and 'Ašavastəma' "Most Righteous".&lt;ref name="Gray_1926_102"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1926|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yasna'' 40.3, Ahura Mazda is ''ašaŋāč'' "having ''aša'' following".&lt;ref name="Gray_1926_101"/&gt;

===Of other divinities===
One of [[Haoma]]'s stock epithets is ''ašavazah-'' "furthering ''aša''" (''Yasht'' 20.3; ''Yasna'' 8.9, 10.1.14, 11.10 et al.). [[Atar]] "possesses strength through ''aša''" (''aša-ahojah'', Yasna 43.4).

==In the Zoroastrian calendar==
In the Zoroastrian calendar, the third day of the month and the second month of the year are dedicated to and named after ''aša'' and Asha Vahishta (calledارديبهشت ''Ordibehesht'' in [[Modern Persian]] both in [[Iranian Calendar]] and Yazdgerdi calendar).

A special service to ''aša'' and Aša, known as the '[[Yasna|''Jashan'']] of Ardavisht', is held on the day on which month-name and day-name dedications intersect. In the ''Fasli'' and ''Bastani'' variants of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], this falls on April 22.

Rapithwin, one of the five ''gah''s (watches) of the day, under the protection of Aša. (''Bundahishn'' 3.22) This implies that all prayers recited between noon and three invoke Aša. Noon is considered to be the "perfect" time, at which instant the world was created and at which instant time will stop on the day of the final renovation of the world.

In the winter months, the [[daeva|''daev''ic]] time of year, Rapithwin is known as the ''Second Havan'' (the first Havan being from dawn to noon), and with the first day of spring, March 21, Rapithwin symbolically returns. This day, March 21, is [[Nowruz]].

Nowruz, the holiest of all [[Zoroastrian festivals]] is dedicated to Aša. It follows immediately after Pateti, the day of introspection and the Zoroastrian equivalent of All-Souls Day. Nowruz, Zoroastrianism's New Year's Day, is celebrated on the first day of spring, traditionally understood to be the day of rebirth, and literally translated means "New Day". The first month of the year of the Zoroastrian calendar is Farvadin, which is dedicated to and named after the [[Fravashi|Fravašis]], the guardian spirits of the dead.

"The underlying idea of the dedication" of the second month of the year to Asha Vahishta "may be revivification of the earth after the death of winter."&lt;ref name="Gray_1904_197"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1904|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
On [[Kushan]] coins, Asha Vahishta "appears as Ašaeixšo, with a diadem and nimbus, like Mithra in the same series."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_390"/&gt;

==In proper names==
"''Arta-'' (Mid. Iranian ''ard-''), representing either the Av. divinity Aša or the principle ''aša'', occurs frequently as an element in Iranian personal names."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1987_390"/&gt;

Schmitt (654)-655 --&gt; or "dominion of ''arta''."

Middle Iranian ''ard-'' is also suggested to be the root of names of the current day Iranian cities of [[Ardabil]], [[Ardekan]], [[Mashhad-e Ardehal|Ardehal]] and [[Ardestan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''drvant''). It could then also be a continuation of the principle that ''ašavan'' is not only an intrinsic property of divinities, but also applies to everything that pertains to the domain of Ahura Mazda and/or Aša, and thus everything that is not ''dr''ə''gvant''/''drvant''.

== History ==
In 1962 [[Douglas C. Engelbart]] released the report "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|title = Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|date = October 1962|accessdate = 2015-04-20|website = SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223 • Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Washington DC, Contract AF 49(638)-1024 • SRI Project No. 3578 (AUGMENT,3906,).|publisher = [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|last = Engelbart|first = Douglas C|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|archive-date = 2011-05-04|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced, and laid the groundwork for, augmented cognition. In this paper, Engelbart defines "augmenting human intellect"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as "increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Modern augmented cognition began to emerge in the early 2000s. Advances in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological sciences during the 1990s set the stage for the emerging field of augmented cognition – this period has been termed the "[[Decade of the Brain]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major advancements in [[functional magnetic resonance imaging |functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] and [[electroencephalography|electroencephalography (EEG)]] have been pivotal in the emergence of augmented cognition technologies which seek to monitor the user's cognitive abilities. As these tools were primarily used in controlled environments, their further development was essential to pragmatic augmented cognition applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== DARPA's Augmented Cognition Program ===
The [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] has been one of the primary funding agencies for augmented cognition investigators. A major focus of DARPA's augmented cognition program (AugCog) has been developing more robust tools for monitoring cognitive state and integrating them with computer systems. The program envisions "order of magnitude increases in available, net thinking power resulting from linked human-machine dyads [that] will provide such clear informational superiority that few rational individuals or organizations would challenge under the consequences of mortality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|date = June 1, 2004|access-date = 2015-04-19|issn = 1044-7318|pages = 127–130|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|first = Dylan|last = Schmorrow|first2 = Dennis|last2 = McBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = M. L. | year = 2010 | title = VIEWS | url = | journal = Ergonomics In Design | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program began in 2001, and has since be renamed to Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (US) Committee on Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2009. Appendix D, Research on Managing Information Overload in Soldiers Under Stress. Available from:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207983/&lt;/ref&gt; By leveraging such tools, the program seeks to provide warfighters with enhanced cognitive abilities, especially under complex or stressful war conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2002, the program vision is divided into four phases:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Phase 1: Real-time cognitive state detection
* Phase 2: Real-time cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 3: Autonomous cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 4: Operation demonstration and transition
Proof of concept was carried out in two phases: near real time monitoring of the user's cognitive activity, and subsequent manipulation of the user's cognitive state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society ===
The Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society held its first conference in July 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the society's first conference, attendees from a diverse background including academia, government, and industry came together to create an agenda for future research. The agenda focused on near-, medium-, and long-term research and development goals in key augmented cognition science and technology areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, where the society first established itself, continues to host the society's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://2014.hci.international/vamr|title = Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 April 2015|website = HCI International|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translation engines ===
Thad Starner, and the [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] Research Group at Georgia Tech, have been researching systems for the recognition of ASL. Telesign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://research.cc.gatech.edu/ccg/?q=projects/telesign|title = Telesign|date = 2015-04-19|accessdate = 2015-04-19|website = Telesign|publisher = Georgia Tech Contextual Computing Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-way translation system from ASL to [[English language|English]], was shown to have a 94% accuracy rate on a vocabulary with 141 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1853/28993|title = Towards a One-Way American Sign Language Translator|last = |first = |date = May 2004|journal = Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2004.

== Controversy ==

=== Privacy concerns ===
The increasing sophistication of brain-reading technologies has led many to investigate their potential applications for lie detection. Legally required brain scans arguably violate “the guarantee against self-incrimination” because they differ from acceptable forms of bodily evidence, such as fingerprints or blood samples, in an important way: they are not simply physical, hard evidence, but evidence that is intimately linked to the defendant's mind. Under US law, brain-scanning technologies might also raise implications for the Fourth Amendment, calling into question whether they constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroscience, Ethics, and National Security: The State of the Art|last = Tennison|first = Michael|date = March 2012|journal = PLOS Biology |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001289|pmid = 22448146|last2 = Moreno|first2 = Jonathon |pmc=3308927|volume=10|pages=e1001289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human augmentation ===
Many of the same arguments in the debate around [[human enhancement]] can be analogized to augmented cognition. Economic inequality, for instance, may serve to exacerbate societal advantages and disadvantages due to the limited availability of such technologies.

Fearing the potential applications of devices like Google Glass, certain gambling establishments (such as Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas) banned its use even before it was commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|title = Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|date = May 8, 2013|accessdate = |website = IGN|publisher = |last = Clark|first = Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in an [[organism]], usually [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]], in which individuals of a particular species group close to one another for beneficial purposes. Clumping can be caused by the abiotic environment surrounding an organism. [[Barnacles]], for example, group together on rocks that are exposed for the least amount of time during the low tide.&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|last=Karleskint|first=George|title=Introduction to Marine Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBXTCQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=clumping+of+sessile+organisms&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|date=26 April 2012|page=22|publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, clumping in sessile animals starts when one organism binds to a hard substrate, such as rock, and other members of the same species attach themselves afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boucot|first=A.J|title=Evolutionary Paleobiology of Behavior and Coevolution|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFPgBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=clumping+of+sessile+organisms&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbivorous [[snails]] are known to clump around where sufficient algae are present.&lt;ref name =george /&gt; The clumping of [[mussels]] (shown right) has been found to be influenced by competition with other species.

In [[topology]], a mathematical discipline, '''combining dimensions''' into a [[manifold]] consists of taking ''n'' dimensions and visualizing them in a smaller ''m'' dimension. Similar concepts apply when studying [[spacetime]] and [[Calabi–Yau manifolds]]. For example, in [[string theory]], six dimensions are combined into a two dimensional manifold for simple visualization.

In [[economics]], '''discrete choice''' models, or '''qualitative choice models''', describe, explain, and predict choices between two or more [[discrete variable|discrete]] alternatives, such as entering or not entering the [[labor market]], or choosing between modes of [[transport]]. Such choices contrast with standard consumption models in which the quantity of each good consumed is assumed to be a [[continuous variable]]. In the continuous case, calculus methods (e.g. first-order conditions) can be used to determine the optimum amount chosen, and demand can be modeled empirically using [[regression analysis]]. On the other hand, discrete choice analysis examines situations in which the potential outcomes are discrete, such that the optimum is not characterized by standard first-order conditions. Thus, instead of examining “how much” as in problems with continuous choice variables, discrete choice analysis examines “which one.” However, discrete choice analysis can also be used to examine the chosen quantity when only a few distinct quantities must be chosen from, such as the number of vehicles a household chooses to own &lt;ref name="cars"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kenneth E. Train |last=Train |first=K. |year=1986 |title=Qualitative Choice Analysis: Theory, Econometrics, and an Application to Automobile Demand |location= |publisher=MIT Press }} [http://emlab.berkeley.edu/books/choice.html Chapter 8].&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of minutes of telecommunications service a customer decides to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. |last=Train |year=1987 |last2=McFadden |first2=D. |last3=Ben-Akiva |first3=M. |title=The Demand for Local Telephone Service: A Fully Discrete Model of Residential Call Patterns and Service Choice |journal=Rand Journal of Economics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=109–123 |jstor=2555538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[logistic regression]] and [[probit regression]] can be used for empirical analysis of discrete choice.

Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood methods.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrete choice models theoretically or empirically model choices made by people among a finite set of alternatives. The models have been used to examine, e.g., the choice of which car to buy,&lt;ref name="cars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Train |first=K. |last2=Winston |first2=C. |year=2007 |title=Vehicle Choice Behavior and the Declining Market Share of US Automakers |journal=[[International Economic Review]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1469–1496 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2007.00471.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; where to go to college,&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=W.

Discrete choice models are also used to examine choices by organizations, such as firms or government agencies. In the discussion below, the decision-making unit is assumed to be a person, though the concepts are applicable more generally. [[Daniel McFadden]] won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize]] in 2000 for his pioneering work in developing the theoretical basis for discrete choice.

Discrete choice models statistically relate the choice made by each person to the attributes of the person and the attributes of the alternatives available to the person. For example, the choice of which car a person buys is statistically related to the person’s income and age as well as to price, fuel efficiency, size, and other attributes of each available car. The models estimate the probability that a person chooses a particular alternative. The models are often used to forecast how people’s choices will change under changes in demographics and/or attributes of the alternatives.

Discrete choice models specify the probability that an individual chooses an option among a set of alternatives. The probabilistic description of discrete choice behavior is used not to reflect individual behavior that is viewed as intrinsically probabilistic. Rather, it is the lack of information that leads us to describe choice in a probabilistic fashion. In practice, we cannot know all factors affecting individual choice decisions as their determinants are partially observed or imperfectly measured. Therefore, discrete choice models rely on stochastic assumptions and specifications to account for unobserved factors related to a) choice alternatives, b) taste variation over people (interpersonal heterogeneity) and over time (intra-individual choice dynamics), and c) heterogeneous choice sets. The different formulations have been summarized and classified into groups of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baltas|first1=George|last2=Doyle|first2=Peter|title=Random utility models in marketing research: a survey|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=51|issue=2|pages=115–125|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00058-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

* Marketing researchers use discrete choice models to study [[Consumer theory|consumer demand]] and to predict competitive business responses, enabling choice modelers to solve a range of business problems, such as [[pricing]], [[New product development|product development]], and [[Demand curve|demand estimation]] problems.&lt;ref name="cars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

== Common features of discrete choice models ==

Discrete choice models take many forms, including: Binary Logit, Binary Probit, Multinomial Logit, Conditional Logit, Multinomial Probit, Nested Logit, Generalized Extreme Value Models, Mixed Logit, and Exploded Logit. All of these models have the features described below in common.

=== Choice set ===

The choice set is the set of alternatives that are available to the person. For a discrete choice model, the choice set must meet three requirements:

# The set of alternatives must be [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], meaning that the set includes all possible alternatives. This requirement implies that the person necessarily does choose an alternative from the set.
# The alternatives must be [[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]], meaning that choosing one alternative means not choosing any other alternatives. This requirement implies that the person chooses only one alternative from the set.
# The set must contain a ''finite'' number of alternatives. This third requirement distinguishes discrete choice analysis from forms of regression analysis in which the dependent variable can (theoretically) take an infinite number of values.

As an example, the choice set for a person deciding which mode of [[transport]] to take to work includes driving alone, carpooling, taking bus, etc. The choice set is complicated by the fact that a person can use multiple modes for a given trip, such as driving a car to a train station and then taking train to work. In this case, the choice set can include each possible combination of modes. Alternatively, the choice can be defined as the choice of “primary” mode, with the set consisting of car, bus, rail, and other (e.g. walking, bicycles, etc.). Note that the alternative “other” is included in order to make the choice set exhaustive.

Different people may have different choice sets, depending on their circumstances. For instance, the [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] automobile was not sold in Canada as of 2009, so new car buyers in Canada faced different choice sets from those of American consumers. Such considerations are taken into account in the formulation of discrete choice models.

=== Defining choice probabilities ===

A discrete choice model specifies the probability that a person chooses a particular alternative, with the probability expressed as a function of observed variables that relate to the alternatives and the person. In its general form, the probability that person ''n'' chooses alternative ''i'' is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; P_{ni} \equiv  \Pr( \text{Person } n \text{ chooses alternative } i)  = G(x_{ni}, \;x_{nj, j \neq i}, \; s_n, \;\beta), &lt;/math&gt;
where

: &lt;math&gt;x_{ni} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of attributes of alternative ''i'' faced by person ''n'',

: &lt;math&gt;x_{nj, j \neq i} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of attributes of the other alternatives (other than ''i'') faced by person ''n'',

: &lt;math&gt; s_n &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of characteristics of person ''n'', and

: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a set of parameters giving the effects of variables on probabilities, which are estimated statistically.

In the mode of [[transport]] example above, the attributes of modes (''x&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''), such as travel time and cost, and the characteristics of consumer (''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), such as annual income, age, and gender, can be used to calculate choice probabilities. The attributes of the alternatives can differ over people; e.g., cost and time for travel to work by car, bus, and rail are different for each person depending on the location of home and work of that person.

'''Properties:'''
* ''P&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is between 0 and 1
* &lt;math&gt;\forall n:\; \sum_{j=1}^J  P_{nj} = 1, &lt;/math&gt;  where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.
* (Expected fraction of people choosing ''i'' ) &lt;math&gt;  = {1 \over N} {\sum_{n=1}^N P_{ni}}, &lt;/math&gt; where N is the number of people making the choice.

Different models (i.e., models using a different function G) have different properties. Prominent models are introduced below.

=== Consumer utility ===
Discrete choice models can be derived from [[utility theory]]. This derivation is useful for three reasons:

# It gives a precise meaning to the probabilities ''P&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''
# It motivates and distinguishes alternative model specifications, e.g., the choice of a functional form for ''G''.
# It provides the theoretical basis for calculation of changes in consumer surplus (compensating variation) from changes in the attributes of the alternatives.

''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility (or net benefit or well-being) that person ''n'' obtains from choosing alternative ''i''. The behavior of the person is utility-maximizing: person n chooses the alternative that provides the highest utility. The choice of the person is designated by dummy variables, ''y&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', for each alternative:

: &lt;math&gt; y_{ni} = \begin{cases}
1 &amp;  U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj} \quad  \forall j \neq i\\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider now the researcher who is examining the choice. The person’s choice depends on many factors, some of which the researcher observes and some of which the researcher does not. The utility that the person obtains from choosing an alternative is decomposed into a part that depends on variables that the researcher observes and a part that depends on variables that the researcher does not observe. In a linear form, this decomposition is expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; U_{ni}= \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} &lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;z_{ni} &lt;/math&gt;  is a vector of observed variables relating to alternative ''i'' for person ''n'' that depends on attributes of the alternative, ''x&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'',  interacted perhaps with attributes of the person, ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that it can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;z_{ni}=z(x_{ni}, s_n) &lt;/math&gt;  for some numerical function ''z'',
*&lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; is a corresponding vector of coefficients of the observed variables, and
*&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ni} &lt;/math&gt; captures the impact of all unobserved factors that affect the person’s choice.

The choice probability is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_{ni}&amp; = \Pr(y_{ni} = 1) \\
       &amp;= \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj}, \right )  \\
      &amp; = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} &gt;  \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj}, \right ) \\
      &amp; = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} \varepsilon_{nj}- \varepsilon_{ni} &lt; \beta z_{ni}- \beta z_{nj}, \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Given ''β'', the choice probability is the probability that the random terms, {{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;nj&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (which are random from the researcher’s perspective, since the researcher does not observe them) are below the respective quantities &lt;math&gt;\forall j \neq i: \beta z_{ni} - \beta z_{nj}.&lt;/math&gt; Different choice models (i.e. different specifications of G) arise from different distributions of ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i'' and different treatments of ''β''.

=== Properties of discrete choice models implied by utility theory ===

==== Only differences matter ====

The probability that a person chooses a particular alternative is determined by comparing the utility of choosing that alternative to the utility of choosing other alternatives:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{ni}= \Pr(y_{ni} = 1) = \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj} \right )  = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} U_{ni} - U_{nj} &gt; 0 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

As the last term indicates, the choice probability depends only on the difference in utilities between alternatives, not on the absolute level of utilities. Equivalently, adding a constant to the utilities of all the alternatives does not change the choice probabilities.

==== Scale must be normalized ====

Since utility has no units, it is necessary to normalize the scale of utilities. The scale of utility is often defined by the variance of the error term in discrete choice models. This variance may differ depending on the characteristics of the dataset, such as when or where the data are collected. Normalization of the variance therefore affects the interpretation of parameters estimated across diverse datasets.

== Prominent types of discrete choice models ==
Discrete choice models can first be classified according to the number of available alternatives.
: * Binomial choice models (dichotomous): 2 available alternatives
: * Multinomial choice models ([[polytomous choice|polytomous]]): 3 or more available alternatives

Multinomial choice models can further be classified according to the model specification:
: * Models, such as standard logit, that assume no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives
: * Models that allow correlation in unobserved factors among alternatives

In addition, specific forms of the models are available for examining rankings of alternatives (i.e., first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.) and for ratings data.

Details for each model are provided in the following sections.

=== Binary choice ===

==== {{anchor|basic logit}} A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====

{{main article|Logistic regression}}

''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility (or net benefit) that person n obtains from taking an action (as opposed to not taking the action). The utility the person obtains from taking the action depends on the characteristics of the person, some of which are observed by the researcher and some are not. The person takes the action, {{nowrap|''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0. The unobserved term, ''ε&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',  is assumed to have a [[logistic distribution]]. The specification is written succinctly as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}  U_n = \beta s_n + \varepsilon_n  \\ y_n = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; U_n &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; U_n \leqslant 0 \end{cases} \\ \varepsilon \sim \text{Logistic} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad  P_{n1} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta s_n)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== {{anchor|basic probit}} B. Probit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====
{{Main article|Probit model}}

The description of the model is the same as [[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''A''']], except the unobserved terms are distributed [[Normal distribution|standard normal]] instead of [[Logistic distribution|logistic]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_n = \beta s_n + \varepsilon_n  \\  y_n = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; U_n &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; U_n \leqslant 0 \end{cases} \\ \varepsilon \sim \text{Standard normal} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{n1}  = \Phi(\beta s_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Cumulative normal|cumulative distribution function of standard normal]].

==== {{anchor|logit varying over alternatives}} C. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives ====

''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility person ''n'' obtains from choosing alternative ''i''. The utility of each alternative depends on the attributes of the alternatives interacted perhaps with the attributes of the person. The unobserved terms are assumed to have an [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]] distribution.&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" &gt;The density and cumulative distribution function of the extreme value distribution are given by &lt;math&gt;f(\varepsilon_{nj}) = \exp (-\varepsilon_{nj}) \exp (-\exp (-\varepsilon_{nj}))&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;F(\varepsilon_{nj}) = \exp (-\exp (-\varepsilon_{nj})).&lt;/math&gt; This distribution is also called the [[Gumbel distribution|Gumbel]] or type I extreme value distribution, a special type of [[Extreme value distribution|generalized extreme value distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases} U_{n1} = \beta z_{n1} + \varepsilon_{n1} \\ U_{n2} = \beta z_{n2} + \varepsilon_{n2} \\ \varepsilon_{n1}, \varepsilon_{n2} \sim \text{iid extreme value} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow  \quad P_{n1}= \frac{\exp(\beta z_{n1})} {\exp(\beta z_{n1})+\exp(\beta z_{n2})} &lt;/math&gt;

We can relate this specification to [[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model ''' A ''']] above, which is also binary logit. In particular, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt; can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n1} =\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta (z_{n1}-z_{n2}))}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if two error terms are [[iid]] [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt; their difference is distributed [[Logistic function|logistic]], which is the basis for the equivalence of the two specifications.

==== {{anchor|probit varying over alternatives}} D. Probit with variables that vary over alternatives ====
The description of the model is the same as [[#C. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives|model '''C''']], except the difference of the two unobserved terms are distributed [[Normal distribution|standard normal]] instead of [[Logistic function|logistic]].

Then the probability of taking the action is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n1} = \Phi(\beta (z_{n1}-z_{n2})),&lt;/math&gt; 
where Φ is the [[Cumulative normal|cumulative distribution function of standard normal]].

Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood methods.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

=== Multinomial choice without correlation among alternatives ===

==== {{anchor|multinomial logit}} E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====
{{Main article|Multinomial logit}}

The utility for all alternatives depends on the same variables, ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', but the coefficients are different for different alternatives:

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
*Since only differences in utility matter, it is necessary to normalize &lt;math&gt;\beta_i =0 &lt;/math&gt; for one alternative. Assuming &lt;math&gt; \beta_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;,
*{{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are  [[iid]]  [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]]&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt;
The choice probability takes the form
: &lt;math&gt;P_{ni}= {\exp(\beta_i s_n) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta_j s_n)},&lt;/math&gt;
where J is the total number of alternatives.

==== {{anchor|multinomial logit varying over alternatives|conditional logit}} F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit) ====

The utility for each alternative depends on attributes of that alternative, interacted perhaps with attributes of the person:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_{ni} = \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} \\ \varepsilon_{ni} \sim \text{iid extreme value} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{ni} = {\exp(\beta z_{ni}) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.

Note that [[#E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''E''']] can be expressed in the same form as model '''F''' by appropriate respecification of variables. Define &lt;math&gt;w_{nj}^k=s_n \delta_{jk} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] and ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''  are from [[#E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''E''']]. Then, model '''F''' is obtained by using

:&lt;math&gt;z_{nj}  = \left \{ w^1_{nj}, \cdots, w^J_{nj} \right \}  \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \left \{ \beta_1, \cdots,\beta_J \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.

=== {{anchor|multinomial correlated alternatives}} Multinomial choice with correlation among alternatives ===

A standard logit model is not always suitable, since it assumes that there is no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives. This lack of correlation translates into a particular pattern of substitution among alternatives that might not always be realistic in a given situation. This pattern of substitution is often called the  [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives|Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property]] of standard logit models. See the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#Criticisms of the IIA assumption|Red Bus/Blue Bus]] example in which this pattern does not hold,&lt;ref name=benakiva-lerman-1985&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Akiva |first=M. |last2=Lerman |first2=S. |year=1985 |title=Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand |series=Transportation Studies |location=Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the path choice example.&lt;ref name=benakiva-bierlaire-1999&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Ben-Akiva |first2=M. |last2=Bierlaire |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://roso.epfl.ch/mbi/handbook-final.pdf |chapter=Discrete Choice Methods and Their Applications to Short Term Travel Decisions |editor-first=R.

The following sections describe Nested Logit, GEV, Probit, and Mixed Logit models in detail.

==== {{anchor|nested logit}} G. Nested Logit and  Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models ====

The model is the same as [[#F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit)|model '''F''']] except that the unobserved component of utility is correlated over alternatives rather than being independent over alternatives.

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''βz&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
* The marginal distribution of each ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt; but their joint distribution allows correlation among them.
*The probability takes many forms depending on the pattern of correlation that is specified. See  [[Generalized extreme value distribution|Generalized Extreme Value]].

==== {{anchor|multinomial probit}} H. Multinomial probit ====
{{Main article|Multinomial probit}}

The model is the same as [[#G. Nested Logit and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV models)|model '''G''']] except that the unobserved terms are distributed jointly [[Normal distribution|normal]], which allows any pattern of correlation and [[heteroscedasticity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_{ni} = \beta z_{ni} +\varepsilon_{ni} \\ \varepsilon_n \equiv (\varepsilon_{n1},\cdots,\varepsilon_{nJ}) \sim N(0,\Omega)  \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{ni} = \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}\beta z_{ni}+\varepsilon_{ni} &gt; \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj} \right )  = \int I\left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}\beta z_{ni}+\varepsilon_{ni} &gt; \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj} \right ) \phi(\varepsilon_n | \Omega) \;d \varepsilon_n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \phi(\varepsilon_n | \Omega) &lt;/math&gt; is the joint normal density with mean zero and covariance &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt;.

The integral for this choice probability does not have a closed form, and so the probability is approximated by quadrature or [http://elsa.berkeley.edu/choice2/ch5.pdf simulation].

When &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix (such that there is no correlation or [[heteroscedasticity]]), the model is called independent probit.

==== {{anchor|mixed logit}} I. Mixed logit ====
{{Main article|Mixed logit}}

Mixed Logit models have become increasingly popular  in recent years for several reasons. First, the model allows ''β''  to be random in addition to ''ε''.  The randomness in ''β'' accommodates random taste variation over people and correlation across alternatives that generates flexible substitution patterns.  Second, the advent in simulation has made approximation of the model fairly easy. In addition, [[Daniel McFadden|McFadden]] and [[Kenneth E. Train|Train]] have shown that any true choice model can be approximated, to any degree of accuracy by a mixed logit with appropriate specification of explanatory variables and distribution of coefficients.&lt;ref name="mt-mnl" /&gt;

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''βz&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
*&lt;math&gt;\beta \sim f(\beta | \theta) &lt;/math&gt; for any distribution &lt;math&gt; \it f &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the set of distribution parameters (e.g. mean and variance) to be estimated,
*{{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∼ }} [[iid]] [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt;
The choice probability is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ni}= \int_\beta L_{ni} (\beta)  f(\beta | \theta) \, d\beta,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; L_{ni} (\beta) = {\exp(\beta z_{ni}) \over {\sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})}}&lt;/math&gt; 
is logit probability evaluated at &lt;math&gt; \beta, &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; the total number of alternatives.

The integral for this choice probability does not have a closed form, so the probability is approximated by simulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/choice2/ch6.pdf]. Also see [[Mixed logit]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model applications ===

The models described above are adapted to accommodate rankings and ratings data.

==== Ranking of alternatives ====
In many situations, a person's ranking of alternatives is observed, rather than just their chosen alternative. For example, a person who has bought a new car might be asked what he/she would have bought if that car was not offered, which provides information on the person's second choice in addition to their first choice. Or, in a survey, a respondent might be asked:

::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: Rank the following cell phone calling plans from your most preferred to your least preferred.
:: * $60 per month for unlimited anytime minutes, two-year contract with $100 early termination fee
:: * $30 per month for 400 anytime minutes, 3 cents per minute after 400 minutes, one-year contract with $125 early termination fee
:: * $35 per month for 500 anytime minutes, 3 cents per minute after 500 minutes, no contract or early termination fee
:: * $50 per month for 1000 anytime minutes, 5 cents per minute after 1000 minutes, two-year contract with $75 early termination fee

The models described above can be adapted to account for rankings beyond the first choice. The most prominent model for rankings data is the exploded logit and its mixed version.

===== {{anchor|exploded logit}} J. Exploded logit =====

Under the same assumptions as for a standard logit ([[#F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit)|model '''F''']]), the probability for a ranking of the alternatives is a product of standard logits. The model is called  "exploded logit" because the choice situation that is usually represented as one logit formula for the chosen alternative is expanded ("exploded") to have a separate logit formula for each ranked alternative. The exploded logit model is the product of standard logit models with the choice set decreasing as each alternative is ranked and leaves the set of available choices in the subsequent choice.

Without loss of generality, the alternatives can be relabeled to represent the person's ranking, such that alternative 1 is the first choice, 2 the second choice, etc. The choice probability of ranking J alternatives as 1, 2, …, J is then

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\text{ranking } 1, 2, \ldots , J) = {\exp(\beta z_1) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})} {\exp(\beta z_2) \over \sum_{j=2}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})} \ldots {\exp(\beta z_{J-1}) \over \sum_{j=J-1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})}&lt;/math&gt;

As with standard logit, the exploded logit model assumes no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives. The exploded logit can be generalized, in the same way as the standard logit is generalized, to accommodate correlations among alternatives and random taste variation. The "mixed exploded logit" model is obtained by probability of the ranking, given above, for ''L&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the mixed logit model ([[#I. Mixed Logit|model '''I''']]).

This model is also known in econometrics as the ''rank ordered logit model'' and it was introduced in that field by Beggs, Cardell and [[Jerry Hausman|Hausman]] in 1981.&lt;ref name = "bch"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beggs |first=S. |last2=Cardell |first2=S. |last3=Hausman |first3=J. |year=1981 |title=Assessing the Potential Demand for Electric Cars |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(81)90056-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "combes" /&gt; One application is the Combes et al. paper explaining the ranking of candidates to become professor.&lt;ref name = "combes"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pierre-Philippe |last=Combes |first2=Laurent |last2=Linnemer |first3=Michael |last3=Visser |title=Publish or Peer-Rich?

==== Ratings data ====

In surveys, respondents are often asked to give ratings, such as:

::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: Please give your rating of how well the President is doing.
:: 1: Very badly
:: 2: Badly
:: 3: Okay
:: 4: Well
:: 5: Very well

Or,
::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: On a 1-5 scale where 1 means disagree completely and 5 means agree completely, how much do you agree with the following statement. "The Federal government should do more to help people facing foreclosure on their homes."

A multinomial discrete-choice model can examine the responses to these questions ([[#G. Nested Logit and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models|model '''G''']], [[#H. Multinomial Probit|model '''H''']], [[#I. Mixed Logit|model '''I''']]). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural to think that the respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.

===== {{anchor|ordered logit}} K. Ordered logit =====
{{Main article|Ordered logit}}

Let ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent the strength of survey respondent ''n''’s feelings or opinion on the survey subject. Assume that there are cutoffs of the level of the opinion in choosing particular response. For instance, in the example of the helping people facing foreclosure, the person chooses
* 1, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; a
*  2, if a &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; b
*  3, if b &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; c
*  4, if c &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; d
*  5, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; d,
for some real numbers ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''.

Defining &lt;math&gt; U_n = \beta z_n + \varepsilon, \; \varepsilon \sim&lt;/math&gt; [[Logistic function|Logistic]], then the probability of each possible response is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr(\text{choosing }  1) &amp; = \Pr(U_n &lt;a) = \Pr(\varepsilon &lt; a - \beta z_n) = {1 \over 1+\exp(-(a - \beta z_n))} \\
\Pr(\text{choosing }  2) &amp; = \Pr(a &lt; U_n &lt; b) =\Pr(a- \beta z_n &lt; \varepsilon  &lt; b - \beta z_n) = {1 \over 1+\exp(-(b - \beta z_n))} - {1 \over 1+\exp(-(a - \beta z_n))} \\
&amp; \cdots \\
\Pr(\text{choosing } 5) &amp; = \Pr(U_n  &gt;  d) = \Pr(\varepsilon  &gt;  d - \beta z_n) = 1 - {1 \over 1+\exp(-(d - \beta z_n))}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters of the model are the coefficients ''β'' and the cut-off points {{nowrap|''a − d''}}, one of which must be normalized for identification. When there are only two possible responses, the ordered logit is the same a binary logit ([[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''A''']]), with one cut-off point normalized to zero.

===== {{anchor|ordered probit}} L. Ordered probit =====
{{Main article|Ordered probit}}

The description of the model is the same as [[#K. Ordered Logit|model '''K''']], except the unobserved terms have [[normal distribution]] instead of [[Logistic function|logistic]].

The choice probabilities are (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr(\text{choosing } 1) &amp;= \Phi (a - \beta z_n)  \\
\Pr(\text{choosing } 2) &amp;= \Phi (b - \beta z_n) -  \Phi (a - \beta z_n) \\
&amp;\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== {{anchor|dynamic discrete choice}} Dynamic discrete choice models ==
Discrete choice models of [[Dynamic programming|dynamic programming]], more commonly called ''dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models'', generalize [[Utility theory|utility theory]] upon which discrete choice models are based. Rather than assuming observed choices are the result of static utility maximization, observed choices in DDC models are assumed to result from an agent's maximization of the [[Present value|present value]] of utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| first1     = Michael P.
| last1      = Keane
| first2     = Kenneth I.

| date       = 2009
| doi 	     = 10.1016/j.red.2008.07.001
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of DDC models is to estimate the [[Structural estimation|structural parameters]] of the agent's decision process. Once these parameters are known, the researcher can then use the estimates to simulate how the agent would behave in a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] state of the world. (For example, how a prospective college student's enrollment decision would change in response to a tuition increase.)

=== {{anchor|mathematical representation}} Mathematical representation ===
Agent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'s [[Bellman_equation#A_dynamic_decision_problem|maximization problem]] can be written mathematically as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
V\left(x_{n0}\right)=\max_{\left\{d_{nt}\right\}_{t=1}^{T}}\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{t^{\prime}=t}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{J}\beta^{t^{\prime}-t}\left(d_{nt}=i\right)U_{nit}\left(x_{nt},\varepsilon_{nit}\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;,

where 
* &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; are [[State variable|state variables]], with &lt;math&gt;x_{n0}&lt;/math&gt; the agent's [[Initial condition|initial condition]]
* &lt;math&gt;d_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; represents &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'s decision from among &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; discrete alternatives
* &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \left(0,1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Discounting#Discount_factor|discount factor]]
* &lt;math&gt;U_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Utility theory|flow utility]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; receives from choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and depends on both the state &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; and unobserved factors &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Time horizon|time horizon]]
* The expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\left(\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; is taken over both the &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;'s in &lt;math&gt;U_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the agent is uncertain about future transitions in the states, and is also uncertain about future realizations of unobserved factors.

==== {{anchor|simplifying assumptions}} Simplifying assumptions and Notation ====
It is standard to impose the following simplifying assumptions and notation of the dynamic decision problem:

'''1. Flow utility is additively separable and linear in parameters'''

The flow utility can be written as an additive sum, consisting of deterministic and stochastic elements. The deterministic component can be written as a linear function of the [[Structural estimation|structural parameters]].

&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{5}
U_{nit}\left(x_{nt},\varepsilon_{nit}\right) &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; u_{nit}          &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \varepsilon_{nit} &amp; \\
                                             &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; X_{nt}\alpha_{i} &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \varepsilon_{nit} &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. The optimization problem can be written as a [[Bellman equation]]'''

Define by &lt;math&gt;V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right)&lt;/math&gt; the ''ex ante'' value function for individual &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; just before &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; is revealed:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right) = \mathbb{E} \max_{i} \left\{ u_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \varepsilon_{nit} + \beta \int_{x_{t+1}} V_{nt+1}\left(x_{nt+1}\right) dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right) \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the expectation operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is over the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'s, and where &lt;math&gt;dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right)&lt;/math&gt; represents the probability distribution over &lt;math&gt;x_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; conditional on &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation over state transitions is accomplished by taking the integral over this probability distribution.

It is possible to decompose &lt;math&gt;V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right)&lt;/math&gt; into deterministic and stochastic components:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right) = \mathbb{E} \max_{i} \left\{ v_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \varepsilon_{nit} \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is the value to choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and is written as

&lt;math&gt;
v_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) = u_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \beta \int_{x_{t+1}} \mathbb{E} \max_{j} \left\{ v_{njt+1}\left(x_{nt+1}\right) + \varepsilon_{njt+1} \right\} dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where now the expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is taken over the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{njt+1}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''3. The optimization problem follows a [[Markov decision process]]'''

The states &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt; follow a [[Markov chain]]. That is, attainment of state &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the state &lt;math&gt;x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;x_{t-2}&lt;/math&gt; or any prior state.


==== {{anchor|conditional value function}} Conditional value functions and choice probabilities ====
The value function in the previous section is called the '''conditional value function''', because it is the value function conditional on choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Writing the conditional value function in this way is useful in constructing formulas for the choice probabilities.

To write down the choice probabilities, the researcher must make an assumption about the distribution of the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;'s. As in static discrete choice models, this distribution can be assumed to be [[iid]]  [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]], [[Generalized extreme value distribution|Generalized Extreme Value]], [[Multinomial probit]], or [[Mixed logit]].

For the case where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is multinomial logit (i.e. drawn [[iid]] from the [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value distribution]]), the formulas for the choice probabilities would be:

&lt;math&gt;P_{nit}= {\exp\left(v_{nit}\right) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp\left(v_{njt}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Estimation ===
Estimation of dynamic discrete choice models is particularly challenging, due to the fact that the researcher must solve the backwards recursion problem for each guess of the structural parameters.

The most common methods used to estimate the structural parameters are [[Maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[Method of simulated moments]]. 

Aside from estimation methods, there are also solution methods. Different solution methods can be employed due to complexity of the problem. These can be divided into '''full-solution methods''' and '''non-solution methods'''.


==== {{anchor|full solution}} Full-solution methods ====

The foremost example of a full-solution method is the [[John_Rust#The_Nested_Fixed_Point_(NFXP)_algorithm|Nested Fixed Point (NFXP) algorithm]] developed by [[John Rust]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The NFXP algorithm is described in great detail in its documentation manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent work by Che-Lin Su and [[Kenneth Judd]] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

| first1     = Che-Lin

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; implements another approach (dismissed as intractable by Rust in 1987), which uses [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization]] of the likelihood function, and is referred to as mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC).
Specifically, the likelihood function is maximized subject to the constrains imposed by the model, and expressed in terms of the additional variables that describe the model's structure. This approach requires powerful optimization software such as [[Artelys_Knitro|Artelys Knitro]] because of high dimensionality of the optimization problem.
Once it is solved, both the structural parameters that maximize the likelihood, and the solution of the model are found. 

In the later article&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1      = Iskhakov
| first1     = Fedor
| last2      = Lee
| first2     = Jinhyuk

| url 	     = https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12605
| doi        = 10.3982/ECTA12605 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Rust and coauthors show that the speed advantage of the MPEC compared to NFXP is not significant. Yet, because the computations required by MPEC do not rely on the structure of the model, its implementation is much less labor intensive.

==== {{anchor|non solution}} Non-solution methods ====

An alternative to full-solution methods is non-solution methods. In this case, the researcher can estimate the structural parameters without having to fully solve the backwards recursion problem for each parameter guess. Non-solution methods require more assumptions, but the additional assumptions are in many cases realistic and at the very least can save the researcher's time by not having to solve the model. 

The leading non-solution method is conditional choice probabilities, developed by V. Joseph Hotz and Robert A. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[biochemistry]], an '''Eadie–Hofstee diagram''' (also '''Woolf–Eadie–Augustinsson–Hofstee''' or '''Eadie–Augustinsson plot''') is a graphical representation of [[enzyme kinetics]] in which [[reaction rate]] is plotted as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the ratio between rate and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] [[concentration]]:

:&lt;math&gt;v = -K_M { v \over [S] } + V_\max&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' represents reaction rate, ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Michaelis–Menten constant]], [''S''] is the substrate concentration, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum reaction rate.

It can be derived from the Michaelis–Menten equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v = {{V_\max{} [S]} \over {K_M + [S]}}&lt;/math&gt;

invert and multiply with &lt;math&gt;V_\max&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {V_\max \over v} = {{V_\max{}(K_M+[S])}\over{V_\max{}[S]}} = {{K_M+[S]}\over{[S]}}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\max = {{{vK_M} \over {[S]}} + {{v[S]} \over {[S]}}} = {{vK_M}\over {[S]}} + v&lt;/math&gt;

Isolate v:

:&lt;math&gt;v = -K_M{v \over {[S]}} + V_\max&lt;/math&gt;

A plot of v against ''v''/[S] will hence yield ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; as the y-intercept, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; as the x-intercept, and ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the negative  slope. Like other techniques that linearize the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]], the Eadie-Hofstee plot was used historically for rapid identification of important kinetic terms like ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, but has been superseded by [[nonlinear regression]] methods that are significantly more accurate and no longer computationally inaccessible.  It is also more robust against error-prone data than the [[Lineweaver–Burk plot]], particularly because it gives equal weight to data points in any range of substrate concentration or reaction rate. (The Lineweaver–Burk plot unevenly weights such points.)  Both plots remain useful as a means to present data graphically.

One drawback from the Eadie–Hofstee approach is that neither [[ordinate]] nor [[abscissa]] represent [[independent variable]]s: both are dependent on reaction rate. Thus any experimental error will be present in both axes. Also, experimental error or [[Propagation of uncertainty|uncertainty will propagate]] unevenly and become larger over the [[abscissa]] thereby giving more weight to smaller values of ''v''/[S]. Therefore, the typical measure of goodness of fit for [[linear regression]], the correlation coefficient ''R'', is not applicable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Eco-investing''' or '''green investing''', is a form of [[socially responsible investing]] where investments are made in companies that support or provide [[environmentally friendly]] products and practices. These companies encourage (and often profit from) new technologies that support the transition from carbon dependence to more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henshaw |first=Mark |title=Eco Investor Guide |publisher=Eco Investor Guide, Inc. |year=2010 |url=http://www.ecoinvestorguide.com/wp-content/uploads/EcoInvestorGuide.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industries' environmental impacts become more apparent, green topics have not only taken center stage in pop culture, but the financial world as well. In the 1990s many investors “began to look for those companies that were better than their competitors in terms of managing their environmental impact.” While some investors still focus their funds to avoid only “the most egregious polluters,” the emphasis for many investors has switched to changing “the way money is used,” and using “it in a positive, transformative way to get us from where we are now ultimately to a truly sustainable society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keane |first=Robert F. |title=The Green Advisor: SRI &amp; Green Investing Grow Up |publisher=Investment Advisor |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.advisorone.com/2009/11/01/the-green-advisor-sri-green-investing-grow-up |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard – launched by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance to monitor private investments in green companies – estimated that over $1.248 trillion has been invested in solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/hydro and other green sectors since 2007. This number represents investments from [[North America]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]], as well at other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard Finds Over $1 Trillion Invested in Green Since 2007 |publisher=Green Money Journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.greenmoneyjournal.com/article.mpl?newsletterid=51&amp;articleid=749 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco/Green Investing versus Socially Responsible Investing==
While many eco-investments may be considered socially responsible investments, and vice versa, the two are not mutually inclusive. [[Socially responsible investing]] is the practice of investing only in those companies which satisfy certain moral or ethical criteria. This may include companies with an interest in the environment, but also supports various other social and religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Socially Responsible Investing |publisher=Investor Glossary |url=http://www.investorglossary.com/socially-responsible-investing.htm |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-investing narrows in on the interests of sustainable environmental issues. Specifically, eco-investments focus on companies who work on renewable energy and clean technologies.

==Eco-investing sectors==
There are several sectors that fall under the eco-investing umbrella. [[Renewable energy]] refers to both solar, wind, tidal current,wave and conventional hydro technology. This includes companies that build [[solar panel]]s or [[wind turbine]]s, or the raw materials and services that contribute to these technologies&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt; It also refers to Energy Storage – companies that develop and use technologies to store large amounts of energy, particularly renewable energies. A good example of this is the fuel cells used in [[hybrid car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Technology &amp; Alternative Fuels |publisher=Demand Media, Inc. |url=http://www.greencar.com/alternative-fuels-green-technology.php |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under the renewable energy sector are Biofuels. This group includes companies that use or supply biological resources (like algae, corn or waster wood) to create energy or fuel. Other technologies that are included in the renewable energy group are: Geothermal (companies who use or convert heat to electric energy) and Hydroelectricity (companies who harness water energy to make electricity).&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Buildings and Efficiency sector refers to companies that manufacture green building materials or energy-efficient services in the world of engineering and architecture. Green building materials include energy-efficient glass, insulation, and lighting among others. Recycling companies and energy conservation companies also fall under this sector.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Eco Living sector refers to companies that offer sustainable goods and services for healthy living. This includes organic farming, green pesticides, health care and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

Green investment has significantly grown in the UK and there are now 136 funds listed on the [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library Worldwise Investor fund library] under the themes: Agriculture, Carbon, Clean Energy, Forestry, Environmental, Multi-thematic and Water. All of these funds account for around [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/knowledge/reports?fd=%2527%2582%25F9%25B8%257F%25C5%2500%25BB%25E3%25B61sXm%25F1%259E%2584%252FK%2591%250E-%25F2%25B1x0L%25DFW%25B9%25C2Z%250Bf%2589%2501%25CCY%25C1%25D1%259A%2594%25E7%25C92s%25C5 £21.8bn] in the UK.

'''Enthalpy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|θ|əl|p|i|audio=en-US-enthalpy.ogg}}, a property of a [[thermodynamic system]], is equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |title=Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=2018-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817085918/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/E/E02141.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book. Enthalpy, H |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy.

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]]. Other historical conventional units still in use include the [[British thermal unit|British thermal unit (BTU)]] and the [[calorie]].

Enthalpy comprises a system's [[internal energy]], which is the energy required to create the system, plus the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] required to make room for it by displacing its [[environment (systems)|environment]] and establishing its volume and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark W. |last=Zemansky |date=1968 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |chapter=Chapter 11 |edition=5th |page=275 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthalpy is defined as a [[state function]] that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity.

Enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ''H''. The Δ''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes.

'''For processes under constant pressure''', Δ''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] p ΔV done by the system on its surroundings (which is &gt; 0 for an expansion and &lt; 0 for a contraction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. J. |last1=Van Wylen |first2=R. E. |last2=Sonntag |date=1985 |title=Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics |chapter=Section 5.5 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-471-82933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Enthalpy of [[ideal gas]]es and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.

==History==
The word ''enthalpy'' was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms ''[[energy]]'' (introduced in its modern sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1802) and ''[[entropy]]'' (coined in analogy to ''energy'' by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865).
It uses the root of Greek {{lang|grc|θάλπος}} "warmth, heat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qa%2Flpos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qa%2Flpos0&amp;prior=qalpno/s#lexicon θάλπος] in ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
where ''energy'' has {{lang|grc|ἔργον}} "work" and ''entropy'' {{lang|grc|τροπή}} "transformation", by analogy expressing the idea of "heat-content" where energy refers to "work-content" and entropy to "transformation-content".
The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2002) quotes [[J. R. Partington]] in ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'' (1949) as saying that the function ''H'' was "usually called the heat content".&lt;/ref&gt; 
a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as  {{mvar|dH}} refers to the amount of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ignacio |last1=Tinoco, Jr. |first2=Kenneth |last2=Sauer |first3=James C. |last3=Wang |date=1995 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=41 |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-186545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but not in the general case (when pressure is variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Keith J.|last1=Laidler |authorlink=Keith J. Laidler |first2=John H. |last2=Meiser |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] used the term "a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''The Collected Works of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol. I'' do not contain reference to the word enthalpy, but rather reference the "heat function for constant pressure". See: {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of the concept of "heat content" {{mvar|H}} is associated with [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]] ([[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], 1850).

The term ''enthalpy'' first appeared in print in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Dalton, ''Proc. K. Akad. Wetens. Amsterdam'' 11 (1909), p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to  [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laidler|first1= Keith|authorlink= Keith J. Laidler|title= The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1995|page= 110}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the ''[[enthalpy–entropy chart|Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams]]'', published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol {{mvar|H}} was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in general. 
The definition of {{mvar|H}} as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;

==Formal definition==
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. A. |last=Guggenheim |title=Thermodynamics |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|chapter=Thermochemistry|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-547-12532-9|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034015/http://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + p V,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H'' is the enthalpy of the system,
:''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system,
:''p'' is the [[pressure]] of the system,
:''V'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the system.
Enthalpy is an [[extensive property]]. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the [[specific enthalpy]] ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''m''}}, where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''n''}}, where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_k H_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'' or composition, the summation becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \rho h \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density.

The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S'',''p'') of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - \delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''δQ''  is a small amount of heat added to the system, and ''δW'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives {{nowrap|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T&amp;thinsp;dS''}}, with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only ''pV'' work is done, {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}}. As a result,

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\,dS - p\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''d''(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives

:&lt;math&gt;dU + d(pV) = T\,dS - p\,dV + d(pV),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;d(U + pV) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;dH(S,p) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other expressions==
The above expression of ''dH'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT + V(1 - \alpha T)\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat capacity at constant pressure and ''α'' is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' are known as functions of ''p'' and ''T''.

Note that for an [[ideal gas]], ''αT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&lt;math&gt;\alpha T=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial (\frac{n R T}{P})}{\partial T}\right)_p = \frac{nRT}{PV} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the [[chemical potential]] and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for ''dH'' then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;dH = T\,dS + V\,dp + \sum_i \mu_i\,dN_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as {{nowrap|''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the molar chemical potential) or as {{nowrap|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the specific chemical potential).

==Physical interpretation==
The ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. |last=Reif |title=Statistical Physics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=London |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=C. |last1=Kittel |first2=H. |last2=Kroemer |title=Thermal Physics |publisher=Freeman |location=London |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that Δ''H'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].

For a [[heat engine]] a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Physik|last=Bartelmann|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2015|isbn=978-3-642-54617-4|location=|pages=1106–1108|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dH=\delta Q-\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 
where the work W done by the engine is: 
:&lt;math&gt;W=-\oint pdV&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: {{nowrap|1=''dU'' = ''δQ'' − ''δW''}}. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called ''pV'' work, given by {{nowrap|''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}} (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, ''dV'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work ''δW′'', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV'' + ''δW′''}}. In this case the first law reads:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - p\,dV - \delta W',&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q + V\,dp - \delta W'.&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]:

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (''dp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (''δW'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ebbing|first1=Darrel|last2=Gammon|first2=Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114033110/http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].

[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rathakrishnan|title=High Enthalpy Gas Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.|isbn=9781118821893|date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat of reaction===
{{Main|Standard enthalpy of reaction}}
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the ''enthalpy change'' of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = H_\mathrm{f} - H_\mathrm{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:Δ''H'' is the "enthalpy change",
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an [[exothermic reaction]] at constant [[pressure]], the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings.  In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings. If Δ''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand, if Δ''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith J. |last=Laidler |first2=John H.|last2=Meiser|date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the definition of enthalpy as &lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,&lt;/math&gt; the enthalpy change at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \Delta U + p \Delta V.&lt;/math&gt; However for most chemical reactions, the work term &lt;math&gt;p \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\Delta H.&lt;/math&gt;  As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g), &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; = –566.0 kJ and &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; = –563.5 kJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ralph H. |last=Petrucci |first2=William S.|last2=Harwood |first3=F. Geoffrey|last3=Herring |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th |pages=237–8 |isbn=978-0-13-014329-7|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of [[bond energy|bond energies]].

===Specific enthalpy===
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as ''h'' = {{sfrac|''H''|''m''}} where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The [[SI unit]] for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''u'' + ''pv''}}, where ''u'' is the specific [[internal energy]], ''p'' is the pressure, and ''v'' is [[specific volume]], which is equal to {{sfrac|''ρ''}}, where ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: 
* A [[temperature]] of 25&amp;nbsp;°C or 298.15&amp;nbsp;K,
* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1&amp;nbsp;atm or 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa),
* A [[concentration]] of 1.0&amp;nbsp;M when the element or compound is present in solution,
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.

Chemical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.
* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.
* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.
* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.
* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.
*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.
* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.
* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.
* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.

Physical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of fusion]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states.
* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.
* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.
* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).
* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

===Open systems===
In [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} - dU_\text{out} - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy entering the system, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy leaving the system.

[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation

: &lt;math&gt;\delta W = d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) + \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} + d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) - dU_\text{out} - d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of enthalpy, ''H'', permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and ''pV'' work in fluids for open systems:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dH_\text{in} - dH_\text{out} - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of time derivatives it reads:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_k \dot Q_k + \sum_k \dot H_k - \sum_k p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,&lt;/math&gt;

with sums over the various places ''k'' where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The ''Ḣ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot H_k = h_k\dot m_k = H_m\dot n_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ṁ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the mass flow and ''ṅ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term {{sfrac|''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}} represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in ''pV'' power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{clarify|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average {{sfrac|''dU''|''dt''}} may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \sum_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \sum_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \sum_k \left\langle p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

==Diagrams==
[[File:Ts diagram of N2 02.jpg|500px|thumb|right|''T''–''s'' diagram of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Figure composed with data obtained with RefProp, NIST Standard Reference Database 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The red curve at the left is the melting curve. The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side the saturated liquid and the high-entropy side the saturated gas. The black curves give the ''T''–''s'' relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points '''a''', '''b''', etc., are treated in the main text.]]

The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as ''h''–''T'' diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and ''h''–''p'' diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram (''T''–''s''-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

===Some basic applications===
The points '''a''' through '''h''' in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.
:'''a''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 461&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''b''': ''T'' = 380&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 2&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 530&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''c''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 200&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.16&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''d''': ''T'' = 270&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.79&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''e''': ''T'' = 108&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 13&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.55&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 13&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''f''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.75&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''g''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 2.83&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 28&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''h''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.41&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 230&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);

===Throttling===
{{main|Joule–Thomson effect}}
[[File:Schematic of throttling.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''.]]

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ''T''–''s'' diagram above. Point '''c''' is at 200&amp;nbsp;bar and room temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point '''d''', which is at a temperature of about 270&amp;nbsp;K. Hence the expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar cools nitrogen from 300&amp;nbsp;K to 270&amp;nbsp;K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point '''e''' is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 100 kJ/kg}}. It corresponds roughly with {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 13 bar}} and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 108 K}}. Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;bar ends in the two-phase region (point '''f'''). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in '''f''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in '''g''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''g'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the liquid fraction in '''f''' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in '''h''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the gas fraction in '''f''' {{nowrap|(1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. So

:&lt;math&gt; h_\mathbf{f} = x_\mathbf{f} h_\mathbf{g} + (1 - x_\mathbf{f})h_\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: {{nowrap|1=100 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; × 28 + (1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) × 230}}, so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===
{{main|Gas compressor}}
[[File:Schematic of compressor.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''. A power ''P'' is applied and a heat flow ''Q̇'' is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is [[adiabatic]], the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the ''T''–''s'' diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point '''a''') to 2 bar (point '''b''') would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is ''Q̇''. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\dot Q + \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2 + P.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{\dot Q}{T_\mathrm{a}} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''Q̇'' gives for the minimal power

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, compressing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1&amp;nbsp;bar to 200&amp;nbsp;bar costs at least {{nowrap|1=(''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. With the data, obtained with the ''T''–''s'' diagram, we find a value of {{nowrap|1=(430 − 461) − 300 × (5.16 − 6.85) =}} 476&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(dh - T_\mathrm{a}\,ds).&lt;/math&gt;

With {{nowrap|1=''dh'' = ''T''&amp;thinsp;''ds'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dp''}}, this results in the final relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2 v\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''entrenched player's dilemma''' is a concept featured in ''[[Wikinomics]].'' It is the choice faced by existing businesses in a changing marketplace. To embrace new ideas fully, they must abandon their current revenue streams.

Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams explain the concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The problem with mature companies is that the very commercial success of their products increases their dependency on them. Making radical changes in the product's capabilities, underlying architecture or associated business models could cannibalize sales or lead to costly realignments of strategy and business infrastructure. It's as though popular and widely adopted products become ossified, hardened by the inherent incentives to build on their own success. The result is that entrenched industry players are generally not motivated to develop or deploy disruptive technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, Don ''[[Wikinomics]]'' (New York 2006) 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[Image:eyegouge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Eye-gouging using the thumb]]
'''Eye-gouging''' is the act of pressing or tearing the [[eye]] using the fingers or instruments. Eye-gouging involves a very high risk of [[eye injury]], such as eye loss or blindness.

'''Gaur''' ('today' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) was a Basque artistic group founded in 1966 by [[Amable Arias]], [[Rafael Ruiz Balerdi]], [[Nestor Basterretxea]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Remigio Mendiburu]], [[Jorge Oteiza]], [[José Antonio Sistiaga]], and [[José Luis Zumeta]].&lt;ref name="Bilbao"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/amable-balerdi-basterretxea-chillida-mendiburu-oteiza-sistiaga-zumeta-243|title=Amable, Balerdi, Basterretxea, Chillida, Mendiburu, Oteiza, Sistiaga, Zumeta|publisher=Bilbao Fine Arts Museum|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-guard group, based in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain, provided the springboard for a wide [[History of the Basques|Basque]] artistic movement with close links to influential social, cultural and political agents in the Basque Country opposed to Franco's dictatorship during the 70s and early 80s. 

The group launched with an exhibition on 28 April 1966 at the Barandiarán Gallery in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss2016.eu/en/news/item/2630-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-gaur-group-the-barandiaran-gallery-and-the-contemporary-art-in-the-exhibition-1966-gaur-konstelazioak-2016|title=The 50th anniversary of the Gaur Group, the Barandiaran Gallery and the contemporary art in the exhibition 1966 {{!}} Gaur Konstelazioak {{!}} 2016|work=dss2016.eu|publisher=San Sebastian 2016 – Donostia 2016|date=22 January 2016|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/1/eduardo-chillida/obra/grupo-gaur|title=Grupo Gaur|trans-title=Gaur Group|publisher=Artium|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged the aesthetic moulds and artistic conventions prevailing during that period in Gipuzkoa, and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] altogether. The artists founding the movement stirred at the rapid economic and social changes taking place at the moment, the virtually non-existent cultural scene, and the crisis of the Basque collective identity.

It stood out as the most prolific artistic group in a constellation of groups founded across all the Basque Country during the same period that made up the Basque Art School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5797">'''''Geronimo''''' is a [[US Army]] airborne [[Interjection|exclamation]] occasionally used by jumping [[skydiver]]s or, more generally, anyone about to jump from a great [[height]], or as a general exclamation of [[Anticipation|exhilaration]]. The cry originated in the [[United States]].

==Origins==
At least two different explanations place the origins of the exclamation in [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where some of the first of the [[US Army]]'s [[parachute]] jumps occurred in the 1940s.

According to paratrooper Gerard Devlin, this exclamation dates from August 1940 and is attributed to Private Aubrey Eberhardt, member of parachute test platoon at Fort Benning. The parachute had only recently been adopted for troop drops, and this platoon was the first to test it. On the eve of their first jump, the platoon decided to calm their nerves by spending the day before taking in a film at the Main Post Theatre and a night at the local [[beer garden]]. The film they saw was a [[Western (genre)|Western]] featuring the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Geronimo]]. Its title is uncertain, but it was probably the 1939 film ''[[Geronimo (1939 film)|Geronimo]]'' with [[Andy Devine]] and [[Lone Ranger]] star [[Chief Thundercloud]] in the title role.

On the way back to barracks, Eberhardt's comrades taunted him saying that he would be too scared to remember his name. Eberhardt retorted, "All right, dammit! I tell you jokers what I'm gonna do! To prove to you that I'm not scared out of my wits when I jump, I'm gonna yell ''Geronimo'' loud as hell when I go out that door tomorrow!" Eberhardt kept his promise, and the cry was gradually adopted by the other members of his platoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Gerard M|title=Paratrooper!|year=1979|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Richard Winters'', Winters offers a different explanation: The [[501st Infantry Regiment (United States)|501st Parachute Infantry Regiment]] at [[Fort Benning]] was due to go on the first jump. At the time there was a popular song called "Geronimo" on the radio, which quickly became a favorite amongst the troops. The cry became known to the commanding officer who insisted they would instead jump out and cry ''"Currahee"'', [[Currahee Mountain|the name of a mountain]] at [[Camp Toccoa]], their first training camp. The paratroopers had run up and down the mountain frequently during training, the run known to the troops as "3 miles up, 3 miles down".

There is also a third explanation. Medicine Bluffs on Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where Geronimo was jailed as prisoner of war and his grave is located, are steep cliffs and have come to be known as Geronimo's Bluff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/medicine-bluffs-geronimo/view/google/|title=Medicine Bluffs - Geronimo! in Fort Sill, OK (Google Maps)|date=12 December 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oksenate.gov/senate_artwork/images/artwork/medicine_bluff_at_ft_sill.html|title=Oklahoma State Senate - Senate Artwork|website=www.oksenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall tales were told about Geronimo while at Fort Sill. It was said that one day Geronimo, with the army in hot pursuit, made a leap on horseback down an almost vertical cliff, a feat that the posse could not duplicate. The legend continues that in the midst of this jump to freedom he gave out the bloodcurdling cry of "Geronimo-o-o!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/146|title=Attempted Encroachment on the Medicine Bluffs - Native American Netroots|website=nativeamericannetroots.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/History/_bios/geronimo_pow.htm|title=Fort Sill History - Geronimo|website=sill-www.army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[File:501-Parachute-Infantry-Regiment.svg|thumb|Emblem of the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion]]
Initially, the top brass were wary of the cry, claiming that it constituted a lack of discipline. Others said that it showed bravery and should be encouraged. Eventually the latter view won out, and when the Army's parachute infantry grew, the cry grew with it. In 1941, the Army's first parachute regiment, the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR; now called the [[501st Infantry Regiment (United States)|501st Infantry Regiment]]) incorporated the name "Geronimo" into its insignia, with the permission of the real [[Geronimo]]'s family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-westerns.com/geronimo.htm Geronimo at B-Westerns], retrieved 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_146.html The Straight Dope] Why do parachutists yell "Geronimo!" when jumping from an airplane?", retrieved 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The cry was also incorporated into the song ''Down From Heaven'' by Lieutenant Colonel Byron Paige.

By then, the coverage of the paratroopers' exploits during the war had made the cry "Geronimo" known to the wider public, and its use spread outside the military and U.S. Army.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[File:GHS-pictogram-exclam.svg|thumb|The [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for harmful substances of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.]]

The '''Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals''' ('''GHS''') is an internationally agreed-upon standard managed by the [[United Nations]] that was set up to replace the assortment of hazardous material classification and labelling schemes previously used around the world. Core elements of the GHS include standardized hazard testing criteria, universal warning pictograms, and harmonized safety data sheets which provide users of dangerous goods with a host of information. The system acts as a complement to the [[UN number|UN Numbered]] system of regulated hazmat transport. Implementation is managed through the [[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]]. Although adoption has taken time, as of 2017, the system has been enacted to significant extents in most major countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/implementation_e.html|title=GHS implementation -  Transport - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[European Union]], which has implemented the United Nations' GHS into EU law as the [[CLP Regulation]], and United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standards.

==History==
Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) was created and implemented, there were many different regulations on hazard classification in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the $1.7 trillion per year international trade in chemicals requiring hazard classification, the cost of compliance with multiple systems of classification and labeling is significant. Developing a worldwide standard accepted as an alternative to local and regional systems presented an opportunity to reduce cost and improve compliance. &lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States of America |publisher=OSHA, U.S.A. |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=English (US) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHS development began at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government HSE website|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/index.htm|author=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=UK Government|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Earth Summit (1992)]] when the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that "A globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system, including [[material safety data sheets]] and easily understandable [[symbols]], should be available if feasible, by the year 2000".&lt;ref name=visual&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS: What's Next? {{!}} Visual.ly|url = http://visual.ly/ghs-whats-next|website = visual.ly|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal standard for all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, it is not a compulsory provision of any treaty. The GHS provides a common infrastructure for participating countries to use when implementing a hazard classification and [[Hazard Communication Standard]].&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt;

==Hazard classification==
The GHS classification system is a complex system with data obtained from tests, literature, and practical experience.

The main elements of the hazard classification criteria are summarized below:

===Physical hazards===
Substances or articles are assigned to 9 different [[hazard class]]es largely based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods|United Nations Dangerous Goods System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods -  Model Regulations, Rev. 19 Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117032522/http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html |date=November 17, 2016 }} 2015, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, retrieved 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Additions and changes have been necessary since the scope of the GHS includes all target audiences.
# '''[[Explosives]]''', which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System.
# '''Gases''' are category 1 [[flammable]] if they start to flame in a range in air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the test or calculation method.
# A '''[[flammable liquid]]''' is a liquid with a [[flash point]] of not more than 93&amp;nbsp;°C.  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of four hazard categories on the basis of the flash point and [[boiling point]]. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.
# A '''[[flammable solids|flammable solid]]''' is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.  Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into &lt;br&gt;• flammable solids, &lt;br&gt;• polymerizing substances 
# '''[[self-reactive substance|self-reactive substances]]''', are thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly [[exothermic]] thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air), other than materials classified as explosive, [[organic peroxide]]s or as [[oxidizing]].
# '''[[pyrophoric substance|pyrophoric substance]]''' more coloquially described as spontaneously combusting substances are those solids or liquids that even in small quantities are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. 
# '''[[Self-heating substance|Self-heating substances]]''' A self-heating solids or liquids, other than a [[pyrophoric]] substance, is one which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.
# '''Oxidizing substances and organic [[peroxide]]s ''' contain &lt;br&gt;• category 1: oxidizing substances and&lt;br&gt;• category 2: organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-O- structure and may be considered a derivative of [[hydrogen peroxide]], where one or both of the [[hydrogen]] [[atoms]] have been replaced by [[Substituent|organic radicals]]. The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). &lt;br&gt;Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven 'Types', A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H.
#'''[[Toxic]] and [[infectious]] substances'''
#'''[[Radioactive]] substances''' 
# '''Substances [[corrosive]] to metal''' are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage or even destroy metals. These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests (Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991 - Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990) - non-clad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66). The GHS criteria are a [[corrosion]] rate on [[steel]] or [[aluminum]] surfaces exceeding 6.25&amp;nbsp;mm per year at a test temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;°C.
#'''Miscellaneous''' dangerous substances which includes environmentally dangerous substances

===Health hazards===
* '''[[Acute toxicity]]''' includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selected. Substances are assigned to one of the five [[toxicity]] categories on the basis of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (oral, dermal) or LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;  (inhalation).
* '''Skin corrosion''' means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category.
* '''[[Skin irritation]]''' means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single [[irritation|irritant]] category. For those authorities, such as [[pesticide]] regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided.
* '''Serious eye damage''' means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category.
* '''Eye irritation''' means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category.  For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.
* '''Respiratory sensitizer''' means a substance that induces [[hypersensitivity]] of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Skin sensitizer''' means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for "skin [[wikt:sensitizer|sensitizer]]" is equivalent to "contact sensitizer". Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Germ cell mutagenicity''' means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of [[mutations]] in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''Carcinogenicity''' means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induce [[cancer]] or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''[[Reproductive toxicity]]''' includes adverse effects on sexual function and [[fertility]] in adult males and females, as well as [[developmental toxicity]] in offspring.  Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category: effects on or via [[Lactation]].
* '''[[Specific target organ toxicity]] (STOT) ''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Part 3 Health Hazards| work=Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)| version=Second revised edition|publisher=United Nations| accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for [[Target Organ]] Effects.  All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically included in the GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure.  Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories.  Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.
* '''Aspiration hazard''' includes severe acute effects such as [[chemical pneumonia]], varying degrees of [[pulmonary injury]] or death following [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[lower respiratory system]].  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of [[viscosity]].

===Environmental hazards===

* '''Acute [[aquatic toxicity]]''' means the intrinsic property of a material of causing injury to an [[aquatic organism]] in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[fish]]) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[crustacean]]) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[algae]] or other [[aquatic plants]]). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors.
* '''Chronic aquatic toxicity''' means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data:  LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (fish) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (crustacea) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for algae or other aquatic plants) and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] or [[bioaccumulation]].

===Classification of mixtures===

The GHS approach to the classification of mixtures for health and environmental hazards is also complex.  It uses a tiered approach and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Principles that have been developed for the classification of mixtures, drawing on existing systems such as the [[European Union]] (EU) system for classification of preparations laid down in [[Directive 1999/45/EC]].  The process for the classification of mixtures is based on the following steps:

# Where [[toxicological]] or [[ecotoxicological]] test data are available for the mixture itself, the classification of the mixture will be based on that data;
# Where test data are not available for the mixture itself, then the appropriate [[bridging principles]] should be applied, which uses test data for components and/or similar mixtures;
# If (1) test data are not available for the mixture itself, and (2) the bridging principles cannot be applied, then use the calculation or cutoff values described in the specific endpoint to classify the mixture.

==Testing requirements==

The GHS document does not include testing requirements for substances or mixtures.  In fact, one of the main goals of the GHS is to reduce the need for animal testing.  The GHS criteria for determining health and environmental hazards are test method neutral, allowing different approaches as long as they are scientifically sound and validated according to international procedures and criteria already referred to in existing systems.  Test data already generated for the classification of chemicals under existing systems should be accepted when classifying these chemicals under the GHS, thereby avoiding duplicative testing and the unnecessary use of test animals.  The GHS physical hazard criteria are linked to specific [[UN test methods]].  It is assumed that mixtures will be tested for physical hazards.

==Hazard communication==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Per GHS, hazards need to be communicated:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* in more than one form (for example, placards, labels or SDS’s).
* with [[GHS hazard statements|hazard statements]] and [[GHS precautionary statements|precautionary statements]].
* in an easily comprehensible and standardized manner.
* consistent with other statements to reduce confusion.
* taking into account all existing research and any new evidence.

Comprehensibility is challenging for a single culture and language, so global harmonization is complex. The [[GHS Purple Book]] includes a comprehensibility-testing instrument in Annex 6. Factors that were considered in developing the GHS communication tools include:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* Different philosophies in existing systems on how and what should be communicated;
* Language differences around the world;
* Ability to translate phrases meaningfully;
* Ability to understand and appropriately respond to [[pictograms]].

===GHS label elements===
[[File:GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg|thumb|The symbol for substances hazardous to the human health as implemented by the GHS.]]

The standardized label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''Symbols''' ([[GHS hazard pictograms]]): Convey [[health]], physical and [[Natural environment|environmental]] hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS pictograms -  Transport - UNECE|url = http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/pictograms.html|website = www.unece.org|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an [[exclamation mark]], replacing the European [[saltire]]. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame.  For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the ''[[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]]''. Where a [[transport pictogram]] appears, the GHS pictogram for the same hazard should not appear.
* '''Signal words''':  "Danger" or "Warning" will be used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label.
* '''[[GHS hazard statement]]''': Standard phrases assigned to a [[hazard class]] and category that describe the nature of the hazard.  An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard.

The additional label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''[[GHS precautionary statements]]''': Measures to minimize or prevent [[adverse effects]].  There are four types of precautionary statements covering: prevention, [[Chemical accidents|response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure]], storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard statement and type of hazard.
* '''[[Product identifier]]''' (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS.  The GHS label for a substance should include the [[chemical identity]] of the substance.  For mixtures, the label should include the chemical identities of all ingredients that contribute to acute toxicity, skin corrosion or serious eye damage, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or respiratory sensitization, or Systemic Target Organ Systemic (STOT), when these hazards appear on the label.
* '''Supplier identification''': The name, address and telephone number should be provided on the label.
* '''Supplemental information''': Non-harmonized information on the container of a hazardous product that is not required or specified under the GHS.  Supplemental information may be used to provide further detail that does not contradict or cast doubt on the validity of the standardized hazard information.

===GHS label format===

The GHS includes directions for application of the hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, [[pictogram]], and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion.  There has been discussion about the size of GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional to the size of the label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===Safety data sheet===

The [[safety data sheet]] or SDS (The GHS dropped the word "material" from material safety data sheet in its final revisions) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It should provide comprehensive information about the chemical product that allows employers and workers to obtain concise, relevant and accurate information in perspective to the hazards, uses and [[risk management]] of the chemical product in the workplace. While there were some differences in existing industry recommendations and country specific requirements, there was agreement on a 16 section SDS to include the following headings in the order specified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineehssupply.com/2017/02/25/understanding-ghs-sds-sections/|title=Understanding The GHS SDS Sections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Identification
# Hazard(s) identification
# Composition/ information on ingredients
# [[First-aid]] measures
# Fire-fighting measures
# [[Chemical accidents|Accidental release measures]]
# Handling and storage
# Exposure control/ personal protection
# Physical and chemical properties
# [[chemical stability]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
# Toxicological information
# Ecological information
# Disposal considerations
# Transport information
# Regulatory information
# Other information

The primary difference between the GHS and the international industry recommendations is that sections 2 and 3 have been reversed in order.  The GHS SDS headings, sequence and content are similar to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Union]] and [[ANSI]] MSDS/SDS requirements.  The SDS should provide a clear description of the data used to identify the hazards.  A table comparing the content and format of a MSDS/SDS versus the GHS SDS is provided in Appendix A of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) GHS guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals - GHS|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|website = www.osha.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702005153/http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|archivedate = 2007-07-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

Current training procedures for [[Hazard Communication]] in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt; Educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures at the level of detail by the national authority represents the greatest training challenge.  Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace.  Employees and [[emergency responders]] will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if the importation of products using only GHS labeling is permitted prior to its adoption in the United States and Canada, employers may need to begin employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.

==Implementation==

The [[United Nations]] goal was broad international adoption, and as of 2017, GHS has been adopted to varying degrees in nearly all major countries.

'''Hermann Wilhelm Göring''' (or '''Goering''';{{efn|name=spelling}} {{IPA-de|ˈɡøːʁɪŋ|lang|De-HermannWGoering.ogg}}; 12 January 1893&amp;nbsp;– 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' ("The Blue Max"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].

An early member of the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].

By 1941, Göring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent [[Göring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.

After the war, Göring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] the night before the sentence was to be carried out.

== Early life ==

Göring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst Göring]] (31 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327–330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert Göring|Albert]]. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21–22}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann Göring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Göring in 1907, at age 14]]

Göring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25–45}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22–24}}

Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–25}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}

Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; Göring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, Göring was stationed at [[Mulhouse]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}}

== World War I ==
{{stack|[[File:Göring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of Göring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}

During the first year of World War I, Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[Mülhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' ("air combat forces") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&amp;nbsp;– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28–29}}

After completing the pilot's training course, Göring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Zähringer Lion|Zähringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–32}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165–166}}

On 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], Göring was made commander of the famed "Flying Circus", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–33}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}

In the last days of the war, Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34–36}}

Like many other German veterans, Göring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}

== After World War I ==

Göring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39–41}}{{efn|name=swastika}}

This was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin Göring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''née'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed Göring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After Göring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}

== Early Nazi career ==
[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|left|upright=1.0|thumb|Göring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]

Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-Führer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst Röhm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring:

{{quote|text="I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men."{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}

Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49–51}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Göring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57–58}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59–60}}

Personal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=61}} He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a [[straitjacket]], but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=404}} Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=62, 64}} Hitler, who had written ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' while in prison, had been released in December 1924.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=160}} Carin Göring, ill with [[epilepsy]] and tuberculosis,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=146}} died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.

Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]] as its head rather than Göring, and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In [[German federal election, 1928|the May 1928 elections]] the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=118–121}} Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=66}} The [[Great Depression]] led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and [[German federal election, 1930|in the 1930 election]], the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136, 138}} In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he met the future [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=74}}

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 election]], the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected Göring to the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}}

== Reichstag fire ==
The [[Reichstag fire]] occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]]—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329–330}}

The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=194}} Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but [[Rudolf Diels]], head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=331}} Some researchers, including [[William L. Shirer]] and [[Alan Bullock]], are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=192}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=262}}

At the [[Nuremberg trials]], General [[Franz Halder]] testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, Göring said, "The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=193}} In his own Nuremberg testimony, Göring denied this story.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial Proceedings, 18 March 1946}}

== Second marriage ==
During the early 1930s, Göring was often in the company of [[Emmy Göring|Emmy Sonnemann]], an actress from [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=111}} They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=139–140}} at which Hitler was best man.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=63}} Göring's daughter, [[Edda Göring|Edda]], was born on 2 June 1938.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}}

== Nazi potentate ==
{{Nazism sidebar}}

When Hitler was named [[chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933, Göring was appointed as [[minister without portfolio]], Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} [[Wilhelm Frick]] was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) [[Heinrich Himmler]] hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with [[Rudolf Diels]] at its head. The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}

Hitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst Röhm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=306}} Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=38}}

One of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the [[Luftwaffe]] was formally acknowledged,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=116–117}} with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=364}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C01410, Berlin, Göring auf der "Grünen Woche".jpg|thumb|left|Göring during the ''[[Berlin International Green Week|Grüne Woche]]'' in Berlin, 1937]]

During a cabinet meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357–360}} Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=311}} and [[Walther Funk]] took over the position, as well as control of the [[Reichsbank]]. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=361}} In July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=145}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17986, Schorfheide, Lord Edward Frederik Halifax, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|200px|thumb|Göring with [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] at Schorfheide, 20 November 1937]]

In 1938, Göring was involved in the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], which led to the resignations of the War Minister, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the army commander, General [[Werner von Fritsch]]. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=116}} Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=116, 117}} Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of ''Generalfeldmarschall''. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=642–644}}

{{main article|Anschluss}}
As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=646–652}}

{{main article|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
Although [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}} That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for [[Czechoslovakia]]. [[Neville Chamberlain]] was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the [[Nuremberg Rally]] that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=194–197}} Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the [[Sudetenland]] to Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=674}} In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president [[Emil Hácha]] with the bombing of [[Prague]]. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|2001|p=119}}

Although many in the party disliked him,{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} before the war Göring enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}}{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}} As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}} In Britain and the United States, some viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}}

== World War II ==

=== Success on all fronts ===

Göring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=197, 211}} The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=597}} Later in the day, speaking to the ''Reichstag'', Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany, "If anything should befall me",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=599}} with Hess as the second alternate.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the [[Polish Air Force]] was defeated within a week.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|pp=177–189}} The ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' seized vital airfields in [[Norway]] and captured [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium. Göring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Battles of the Netherlands]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=721, 723}}

After the [[Fall of France]], Hitler awarded Göring the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his successful leadership.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}} During the [[1940 Field Marshal Ceremony]], Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]] des Grossdeutschen Reiches'' (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Göring had already received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}}

The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=113, 136, 143}} Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech, "If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!",{{sfn|Oestermann|2001|p=157}} something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940.{{sfn|Selwood|2015}} Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Göring, like Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy),{{sfn|Raeder|2001|pp=324–325}} was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]]).{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p=337}} Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=144}} After their defeat in the [[Battle of Britain]], the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via [[strategic bombing]]. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=500}} By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by [[the Blitz]], though the bombings continued through May 1941.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=145}}

=== Decline on all fronts ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Reprich-012-08, Wolfschanze, Hitler, Ley, Porsche und Göring.jpg|thumb|Hitler meeting Göring and automotive engineer [[Ferdinand Porsche]] at the ''[[Wolf's Lair]]'' in 1942]]
In spite of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]]—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=178–179}} Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=187}} But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=201}} After the long, but successful, [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Battle of Smolensk]], Hitler ordered [[Army Group Centre]] to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the [[Battle of Moscow]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=207–213}}

Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=404–405}} The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a major turning point of the war,{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=421}} began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=409}} The [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixth Army]] entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in [[Operation Uranus]], Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=412–413}}{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=329}} The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=932}}

=== War over Germany ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1977-149-13, Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|Göring with Hitler and [[Albert Speer]], 10 August 1943]]
Meanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began [[Defence of the Reich|operations against German targets]]. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|on Cologne]] on 30 May 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=438, 441}} Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US [[fighter aircraft]]. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as [[Aachen]] in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=378}}

The American [[P-51 Mustang]], with a [[combat radius]] of over {{convert|1800|mi}} when using underwing [[drop tank]]s, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=461}} German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=447}} Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=296, 297, 299}} As he lost Hitler's trust, Göring began to spend more time at his various residences.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=510}} On [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=295, 302}}

=== End of the war ===

[[File:Goeringcaptivity.jpg|thumb|Göring in captivity 9 May 1945]]

As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=725}} His last birthday, celebrated at the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} Göring arrived at his estate at [[Obersalzberg]] on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1115}}

OKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]], the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}

[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann Göring.ogv|left|thumb|Göring after his capture (May 1945)]]

The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}informing him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}

By 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so Göring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed [[Karl Dönitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320–325}} This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}

== Trial and death ==
[[File:GöringDetentionReport.png|thumb|325px|Prisoner's "mug shot" taken at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice|alt=]]

{{main article|Nuremberg trials}}

Göring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off [[dihydrocodeine]] (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320&amp;nbsp;mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost {{convert|60|lb}}. His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=31}} Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to [[Nuremberg]], which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=329–331}}

Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be "in the sense of the indictment not guilty".{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=336–337}} 

[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Göring (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg trial]]]]

The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defence{{mdash}}the first to be presented{{mdash}}lasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=337}} Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]], who was seated beside him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=341–342}} Göring told US psychiatrist [[Leon Goldensohn]] that the court was "stupid" to try "little fellows" like Funk and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}} He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}}

Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]], a German-speaking US intelligence officer and psychologist, interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} Gilbert kept a journal, which he later published as ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:

[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]

{{quote|sign=Cpt. Gustave Gilbert|source=|Sweating in his cell in the evening, Göring was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking. He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others, and that he had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not believed these atrocities, and that several Jews had offered to testify on his behalf.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=278}}}}

On several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343–347}} When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359–367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H. Jackson]] read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], a major [[pogrom]] in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} Later, [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell-Fyfe]] proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the [[Stalag Luft III murders]]{{mdash}}the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from [[Stalag Luft III]]{{mdash}}in time to have prevented the killings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=371}} He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the [[Hungarian Jews]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=374–375}}

[[File:Goering-corpse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Göring's corpse]]

Göring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:

{{quote|There is nothing to be said in mitigation. For Göring was often, indeed almost always, the moving force, second only to his leader. He was the leading war aggressor, both as political and as military leader; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races, at home and abroad. All of these crimes he has frankly admitted. On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony, but in terms of the broad outline, his own admissions are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt. His guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}}}

Göring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=392–393}} Defying the sentence imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a [[potassium cyanide]] capsule the night before he was to be hanged.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=964}}

One theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner,{{sfn|Taylor|1992|p=623}} after being bribed by Göring, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case.{{sfn|Botting|2006|p=280}} In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s [[26th Infantry Regiment]]{{mdash}}the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials{{mdash}}claimed he gave Göring "medicine" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring's suicide.{{sfn|BBC News|2005}}

Göring's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]], Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the [[Isar]] River.{{sfn|Darnstädt|2005}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}

== Personal properties ==
{{see also|Nazi plunder|Reichswerke Hermann Göring}}
[[File:Göering weapon and baton.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring's ''Reichsmarschall'' baton and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver. To the left is the silver-bound guest book from [[Carinhall]]. ([[West Point Museum]])]]
Göring's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List]]{{sfn|OSS Reports}} compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.{{sfn|NARA Records}}

The confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took [[Political corruption|kickbacks]] from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War]] via [[Pyrkal]] in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=366–368, 538}}

Göring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in [[Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve|Schorfheide Forest]], where he set aside {{convert|100000|acres|km2}} as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, [[Carinhall]], in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=120–123}} The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=244–245}}{{sfn|Rothfeld|2002}} Göring worked closely with the ''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' ([[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]]), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285}} Headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285, 291}} The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=281}}

[[File:Mundur Goeringa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Göring's uniform on display at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr]]'']]

Göring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=115–116}} his ''Reichsmarschall'' uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], the top ''[[Stuka]]'' pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red [[toga]] fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what "a high grade prostitute wears to the opera."{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24–25}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}

Göring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416–417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417–418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}

[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941–45).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Musée de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]

The design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' ("[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.

Though he liked to be called "''der Eiserne''" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that "he sits down on his stomach".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=409}}{{clear left}}

== Complicity in the Holocaust ==
{{see also|Luftwaffe#War crimes}}
[[File:Carta Göring.JPG|thumb|Göring's July 1941 letter to [[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]
[[Joseph Goebbels]] and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} His deputy, [[Erhard Milch]], had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}}

At the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}

In July 1941, Göring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the "Jewish Question". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. Göring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}

Göring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Białowieża Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261–262, 266}}

== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==
{{main article|Albert Göring}}

Göring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps. He was arrested four times, but Hermann secured his release each time. Hermann's daughter [[Edda Göring|Edda]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Albert "could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get."{{sfn|Burke|2010}}

Longmans, Green, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Royce, ''Studies of good and evil: a series of essays upon problems of philosophy and life'', D.

This is also how the higher good is broadly defined in [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], and [[political science]].

'''Inventory control''' or '''stock control''' can be broadly defined as "the activity of checking a shop’s stock."&lt;ref name="MacDiction"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/stock-control |title=stock control |work=Macmillan Dictionary |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more focused definition takes into account the more science-based, methodical practice of not only verifying a business' inventory but also focusing on the many related facets of inventory management (such as forecasting future demand) "within an organisation to meet the demand placed upon that business economically."&lt;ref name="LewisDemand12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOOmR2D88Q0C |chapter=Chapter 1: Demand forecasting and inventory control |title=Demand Forecasting and Inventory Control |author=Lewis, C. |publisher=Routledge |page=3–20 |year=2012 |isbn=9781136346835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other facets of inventory control include [[supply chain management]], [[production control]], financial flexibility, and customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9YjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Inventory Control |author=Axsäter, S. |publisher=Springer |page=1–6 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319157290}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the root of inventory control, however, is the [[inventory control problem]], which involves determining when to order, how much to order, and the logistics (where) of those decisions.&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-1" /&gt;

An extension of inventory control is the inventory control system. This may come in the form of a technological system and its programmed software used for managing various aspects of inventory problems&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9YjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |chapter=Chapter 2: Forecasting |title=Inventory Control |author=Axsäter, S. |publisher=Springer |page=7–35 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319157290}}&lt;/ref&gt; , or it may refer to a methodology (which may include the use of technological barriers) for handling [[loss prevention]] in a business.&lt;ref name="HayesRetail14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEGjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Retail Security and Loss Prevention |author=Hayes, R. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |page=30 |year=2014 |isbn=9781483296005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WesleyAGuide16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pA4SBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 |title=A Guide to Internal Loss Prevention |author=Wesley, R.L.; Wanat, J.A. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=81–3 |year=2016 |isbn=9781483135731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory control systems==
[[Image:HDWR HD2000 Wireless Barcode Reader.png|thumb|Wireless barcoder reader with [[docking station]]]]An inventory control system is used to keep inventories in a desired state while continuing to adequately supply customers&lt;ref name="ChorafasSystems65"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 13: Specifications for Inventory Control |title=Systems and Simulation |editor=Chorafas, D.N. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=233–52 |isbn=9780123749185 |doi=10.1016/S0076-5392(09)60019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9YjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 |chapter=Chapter 11: Implementation |title=Inventory Control |author=Axsäter, S. |publisher=Springer |page=223–34 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319157290}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and its success depends on maintaining clear records on a periodic or perpetual basis.&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WildEssentials02"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5j4D0U6QA0C&amp;pg=PA333 |title=Essentials of Operations Management |author=Wild, R. |publisher=Cengage Learning |pages=332–3 |year=2002 |isbn=9781844800520}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Inventory management software]] often plays an important role in the modern inventory control system, providing timely and accurate analytical, optimization, and forecasting techniques for complex inventory management problems.&lt;ref name="AzadivarOperations16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSCHFC9zaD4C&amp;pg=SA10-PA34 |chapter=10.6 Inventory Management in Practice |title=Operations Research and Management Science Handbook |author=Azadivar, F.; Rangarajan, A. |editor=Ravindran, A.R. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=10-34–10-35 |year=2016 |isbn=9781420009712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DonathIOMA02"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8E5bMwTrBQC&amp;pg=PA505 |chapter=Part II Inventory Management - Chapter 4: Software and Technology |title=The IOMA Handbook of Logistics and Inventory Management |editor=Donath, B.; Mazel, J.; Dubin, C.; Patterson, P. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=504–38 |year=2002 |isbn=9780471209355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical features of this type of software include&lt;ref name="AxsäterInventory15-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DonathIOMA02" /&gt;:

* inventory tracking and forecasting tools that use selectable algorithms and review cycles to identify anomalies and other areas of concern
* [[inventory optimization]]
* purchase and replenishment tools that include automated and manual replenishment components, inventory calculations, and lot size optimization
* lead time variability management
* safety stock calculation and forecasting
* inventory cost management
* shelf-life and slow-mover logic
* multiple location support

Through this functionality, a business may better detail what has sold, how quickly, and at what [[price]], for example. Reports could be used to predict when to stock up on extra products around a holiday or to make decisions about [[special offer]]s, discontinuing products, and so on. 

Inventory control techniques often rely upon [[barcode]]s and [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tags to provide automatic identification of inventory objects—including but not limited to [[merchandise]], [[consumable]]s, [[fixed asset]]s, circulating tools, library books, and [[capital equipment]]—which in turn can be processed with inventory management software.&lt;ref name="GulatiMaint09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igFCp-nz1n8C&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Maintenance and Reliability Best Practices |author=Gulati, R.; Smith, R. |publisher=Industrial Press, Inc |pages=122–4 |year=2009 |isbn=9780831133115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new trend in inventory management is to label inventory and assets with a [[QR Code]], which can then be read with [[smart-phone]]s to keep track of inventory count and movement.&lt;ref name="PantanoInternet17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmyuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT301 |title=Internet Retailing and Future Perspectives |author=Pantano, E.; Nguyen, B.; Dennis, C. et al. |publisher=Routledge |page=PT301 |year=2017 |isbn=9781317378761}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new systems are especially useful for field service operations, where an employee needs to record inventory transaction or look up inventory stock in the field, away from the computers and hand-held scanners.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Inventory control systems have advantages and disadvantages, based on what style of system is being run. A purely periodic (physical) inventory control system takes "an actual physical count and valuation of all inventory on hand ... at the close of an accounting period,"&lt;ref name="DopsonFood15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxotCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |title=Food and Beverage Cost Control |author=Dopson, L.R.; Hayes, D.K. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=115–17 |year=2015 |isbn=9781118988497}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a perpetual inventory control system takes an initial count of an entire inventory and then closely monitors any additions and deletions as they occur.&lt;ref name="DopsonFood15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WildEssentials02" /&gt; Various advantages and disadvantages, in comparison, include:

* Periodic is technically the more accurate as it considers both counted and valued inventory.&lt;ref name="DopsonFood15" /&gt;
* Periodic is more time-consuming than perpetual.&lt;ref name="DopsonFood15" /&gt;
* Perpetual can lower the cost of carrying inventory vs. periodic.&lt;ref name="WildEssentials02" /&gt;
* Perpetual is typically more costly to run than periodic.&lt;ref name="WildEssentials02" /&gt;
* Perpetual needs to be verified from time to time against an actual physical count, due to human error, theft, and other variables.&lt;ref name="DopsonFood15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WallerTheDef14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq8_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=150 |title=The Definitive Guide to Inventory Management: Principles and Strategies for the Efficient Flow of Inventory Across the Supply Chain |author=Waller, M.A.; Esper, T.L. |publisher=Pearson Education |pages=150–1 |year=2014 |isbn=9780133448825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Criminal law */ the change of 2010 to 2009 was because that was the date the new law was passed. In addition, the sentence "increased from 15 to 20 years, or exceptionally more" doesn't make sense because it is irrelevant and misleading. A felony in the Czech Republic carries a sentence of at least 5 years. The numbers given in the sentence are unnecessary and have no significance.</comment>

'''Czech law''', often referred to as the '''legal order of the Czech Republic''' (''{{lang|cs|právní řád České republiky}}''), is the [[Law|system of legal rules]] in force in the [[Czech Republic]], and in the international community it is a member of. Czech [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]).&lt;ref name="bobek"&gt;Bobek, Michal. [http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Czech_Republic1.htm "UPDATE: An Introduction to the Czech Legal System and Legal Resources Online. "] ''GlobaLex''. Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, Sept. 2009. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]] are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.

Written law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important [[Sources of law|source of law]] are: [[Regulation|legal regulations]] ([[Act of Parliament|acts of parliament]], as well as [[delegated legislation]]), [[Treaty|international treaties]] (once they have been [[Ratification|ratified]] by the parliament and [[Promulgation|promulgated]]), and such findings of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]], in which a statute or its part has been nullified as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It is [[government gazette|made public]] by the periodically published ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated ''Sb.'' (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'' (“Collection of International Treaties”).

The system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the [[Velvet Revolution|1989 regime change]]. In 1993, the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been enacted, which postulates the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], outlines the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|structure and principles of democratic government]], and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of  [[European Union law]] over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.

== Sources of law ==

Sources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

* the Constitution (''{{lang|cs|Ústava}}'') and constitutional acts (''{{lang|cs|ústavní zákony}}'')
* international treaties ratified by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|mezinárodní smlouvy ratifikované parlamentem}}'')
* statutes adopted by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|zákony přijaté parlamentem}}''), published decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]
* derived legislation: government orders&lt;ref&gt;also translated as government decrees&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|nařízení vlády}}'') and notifications of ministries&lt;ref&gt;sometimes orders of ministries&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|vyhlášky ministerstev}}''); legislative acts of territorial self-government bodies: regional ordinances&lt;ref&gt;or [[by-law|byelaws]], if you prefer&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|krajské vyhlášky}}'') and municipal ordinances (''{{lang|cs|obecní vyhlášky}}'')

Acts of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are [[Promulgation|promulgated]] (published) in the official ''Collection of Law'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated as ''{{lang|cs|Sb.}}'' – ''Coll.'' – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date. International treaties are similarly published in the ''Collection of International Treaties'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu/ Official online version of Collection of Law and Collection of International Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sbírka zákonů 1993 částka 001 strana 01.png|thumb|The Constitution of the Czech Republic as published in the Collection of Laws]]

=== Constitutional law ===

Czech [[constitution]] is written, and it consists of several [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|constitutional acts]] (one of them [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|the Constitution of the Czech Republic]]), together they are known as the [[constitutional order of the Czech Republic]] (''{{lang|cs|ústavní pořádek}}'').

The constitution can be viewed as [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]], because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concourt1"&gt;Czech Republic. Constitutional Court. [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2092 "Constitutional Order of the Czech Republic. "] ''The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. '' Ústavní soud ČR, n.d. Web. 03 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.

Most important constitutional acts are:

* Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. the Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40450&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=1~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution No. 2/1993 Coll. [...] incorporating Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms [...]&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40453&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=2~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Usnesení č. 2/1993 Sb. Předsednictva České národní rady o vyhlášení LISTINY ZÁKLADNÍCH PRÁV A SVOBOD jako součásti ústavního pořádku České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In full: Resolution no. 2/1993 Coll. of the Presidium of the Czech National Council of 16 December 1992 on the declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms as a part of the constitutional order of the Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Coll. on the Security of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=46612&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=110~2F1998&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 110/1998 Sb. o bezpečnosti České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 347/1997 Coll. on the Creation of Higher Territorial Self-Governing Units&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content Zákon č. 347/1997 Sb. o vytvoření vyšších územních samosprávných celků a o změně ústavního zákona České národní rady č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of [[Separation of powers|Checks and balances]]. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] consisting of two chambers, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. The executive power is divided between the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] and the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. It describes the functioning of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|judiciary]], especially the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]. Two more institutions are established, the [[Czech National Bank]] and the [[Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic|Supreme Audit Office]].

The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] (''{{lang|cs|Listina základních práv a svobod}}'') is a [[bill of rights]] document enacted in 1991 by the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovak Federative Republic]]. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.

The Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the [[President of the Czech Republic]]:&lt;ref name="concourt1" /&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 71/2012 Coll.&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=77110&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=71~2F2012&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 71/2012 Sb., kterým se mění ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky, ve znění pozdějších ústavních zákonů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which amends the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll., the Constitution of the Czech Republic as amended by subsequent constitutional acts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International treaties ===

On joining the [[European Union]], the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of [[Community acquis|European law]] over Czech law in defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Republic. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "[http://www.czech.cz/en/Life-Work/How-things-work-here/Law/The-system-of-independent-courts The System of Independent Courts]. " ''[http://www.czech.cz Hello Czech Republic (Czech Republic - The Official Website)]''. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 01 Jan. 2010. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important treaty in this category is the [[Council of Europe]]’s [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

=== Statutes adopted by the Parliament ===

Major areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.

==== Criminal law ====

Most important statutes in the criminal justice field are:

* Act No. 40/2009 Coll., the Criminal Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=68040&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=40~2F2009&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 40/2009 Sb trestní zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Criminal Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30139&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=141~2F1961&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered as Code of Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Justice&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=55745&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=218~2F2003&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 218/2003 Sb. o odpovědnosti mládeže za protiprávní činy a o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Czech [[criminal law]] is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 (''{{lang|cs|trestní zákoník}}''), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 (''{{lang|cs|trestní řád}}''). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as [[Age of consent|age of legal consent]]) and 17.

Until 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an "elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html "Obecně o trestním zákoníku. "] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217044737/http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html |date=2013-02-17 }} ''Reforma justice. '' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (''{{lang|cs|zločin}}'') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (''{{lang|cs|přečin}}'') introduces a host of community sentences (''{{lang|cs|alternativní tresty}}''), including community payback (''{{lang|cs|veřejně prospěšné práce}}'') or house arrest (''{{lang|cs|domácí vězení}}''). The code also outlaws doping.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt;

Less serious breaches of law are called [[contravention]]s (''{{lang|cs|přestupek}}'').&lt;ref&gt;The word ''přestupek'' (pl. ''přestupky'') can be found translated variously, even in official translations, as ''infraction'', ''administrative infraction'', ''administrative offence'', ''offence'' (!), ''offence'', ''transgression'', ''misdemeanour'', or ''violation''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record. Like with other administrative acts, the outcome of this procedure can be challenged through the administrative justice process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novotný|first=Václav|title=Administrative Justice in Europe – Report for the Czech Republic|date=n.d.|publisher=Association of Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions|url=http://www.juradmin.eu/en/eurtour/i/countries/czech/czech_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example of contraventions in Czech law this are driving offences.

Since 2012, Czech law also recognizes [[Corporate liability|criminal liability of corporations]] for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trubač|first=Ondeřej|title=Trestní odpovědnost právnické osoby|url=http://finance.idnes.cz/trestni-odpovednost-pravnickych-osob-dhf-/pravo.aspx?c=A120305_210154_pravo_vr|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skalická|first=Hana|title=Corporate Criminal Liability in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.terralex.org/publication/p58cf9663e3/corporate-criminal-liability-in-the-czech-republic|work=Newsletter - TerraLex Practice Groups|publisher=TerraLex|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Code codifies core areas of [[private law]]. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt; Although the Code does include [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|registered partnership]], it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf "Zákon 89/2012 občanský zákoník.

The civil code regulation effective since 1 January 2014 is a result of eleven years of work of the recodification committee of the [[Ministry of Justice (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Justice]]. Together with the Commercial Corporations Act and the Private International Law Act it constitutes a complete recodification of private law in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="novyoz"&gt;Czech Republic.

=== Case law ===

Theoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt; Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforceable rulings of the Constitutional Court shall be binding for all agencies and individuals. " – Constitution, Art. 89&lt;/ref&gt; If a lower court is to rule against "consistent adjudications" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fetter|first=Richard W.|title=Musejí nižší soudy poslouchat Nejvyšší soud?|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/paragrafy/zpravy/museji-nizsi-soudy-poslouchat-nejvyssi-soud/453253|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=České noviny|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.&lt;ref name="concourt2"&gt;Czech Republic.

== History ==
[[File:Theresiana-Titel.jpg|thumb|[[Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana]], 1768]]
In [[Czech lands]], the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], when they were a core part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who participated in creating the first [[civil code]] of the country in 1787, called [[Josephinisches Gesetzbuch]]. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (ABGB). ABGB was [[Reception statute|received]] in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the "Middle Civil Code" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the "New Civil Code", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.

Following in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the [[Constitutio criminalis Josephina]] of 1707 and the [[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]] of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian [[criminal code]]s were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.

The history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] out of the ruins of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the [[Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovak nation]]. This lasted over the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] was enacted after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|communist coup]] – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak ''Socialist'' Republic]] and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Further radical modifications were enacted after the [[Velvet Revolution|regime change of 1989]], but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been promulgated after the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|division of Czechoslovakia]], and entered into force in 1993.

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

'''''Life of Jesus''''' ({{lang-de|Das Leben Jesu}}) is one of the earliest works by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. It remained an unpublished fragment, found amongst his posthumous papers. In this essay on morality he presents a version of [[Jesus]] very similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]]; it also stays close to Kant's ''[[Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone]]''. For Hegel the moment Jesus cried out "why hast thou forsaken me", was the moment he knew [[sin]] and evil, for evil is the separation of the individual from the universal.

Jesus is presented as a rationalistic philosopher, opposed to the superstition and "positive religion" of the [[Pharisee]]s. Positive religion is a religion that has a definite historic founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hegel presented biblical miracles as metaphors for Jesus' philosophical doctrines. Whether related with the tenor of Hegel's philosophy of [[immanence]], or just because it remained fragment, the history stops with the crucifixion. The paschal event is absent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">A '''linear response function''' describes the input-output relationship of a [[signal transducer]] such as a radio turning [[electromagnetic wave]]s into music or a [[neuron]] turning [[Synapse|synaptic]] input into a response. Because of its many applications in [[information theory]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] there exist alternative names for specific linear response functions such as [[Magnetic susceptibility|susceptibility]], [[impulse response]] or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], see also [[transfer function]]. The concept of a [[Green's function]] or [[fundamental solution]] of an [[ordinary differential equation]] is closely related.

==Mathematical definition==

Denote the input of a system by &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. a [[force]]), and the response of the system by &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. a position). Generally, the value of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; will depend not only on the present value of &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, but also on past values. Approximately &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a weighted sum of the previous values of &lt;math&gt;h(t')&lt;/math&gt;, with the weights given by the linear response function &lt;math&gt;\chi(t-t')&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\int_{-\infty}^t dt'\, \chi(t-t')h(t')+\dots\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The explicit term on the right-hand side is the [[leading-order|leading order]] term of a [[Volterra series|Volterra expansion]] for the full nonlinear response. If the system in question is highly non-linear, higher order terms in the expansion, denoted by the  dots, become important and the signal transducer cannot adequately be described just by its linear response function.

The complex-valued [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; of the linear response function is very useful as it describes the output of the system if the input is a sine wave &lt;math&gt;h(t)=h_0\cdot \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The output reads

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=|\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|\cdot h_0 \cdot\sin(\omega t+\arg\tilde{\chi}(\omega))\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Amplifier|amplitude gain]] &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|&lt;/math&gt; and [[phase shift]] &lt;math&gt;\arg\tilde{\chi}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Consider a [[damped harmonic oscillator]] with input given by an external driving force &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}(t)+\gamma \dot{x}(t)+\omega_0^2 x(t)=h(t). \, &lt;/math&gt;

The complex-valued [[Fourier transform]] of the linear response function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) = \frac{\tilde{x}(\omega)}{\tilde{h}(\omega)} = \frac{1}{\omega_0^2-\omega^2+i\gamma\omega}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude gain is given by the magnitude of the complex number &lt;math&gt;\tilde\chi (\omega ),&lt;/math&gt; and the phase shift  by the arctan  of the imaginary part of the function, divided by the real one.

From this representation, we see that for small &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; of the linear response function yields a pronounced maximum ("[[Resonance]]") at the frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega\approx\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;. The linear response function for a harmonic oscillator is mathematically identical to that of an [[RLC circuit]].  The width of the maximum &lt;math&gt;,\Delta\omega ,&lt;/math&gt; typically is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 ,&lt;/math&gt; so that the [[Quality factor]] &lt;math&gt;S :=\omega_0 /\Delta\omega&lt;/math&gt; can  be extremely large.

==Kubo formula==
The exposition of linear response theory, in the context of [[quantum statistics]], can be found in a paper by [[Ryogo Kubo]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubo, R., ''Statistical Mechanical Theory of Irreversible Processes I'', Journal of the Physical Society of Japan, vol. ''12'', pp. 570–586 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;  This defines  particularly the [[Kubo formula]], which considers the general case that the "force" h(t) is a perturbation of the basic  operator of the system, the [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]], &lt;math&gt;\hat H_0\to \hat{H}_0 -h(t')\hat{B}(t')\, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\hat B&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a measurable quantity as input, while the output x(t) is the perturbation of the thermal expectation of another measurable quantity &lt;math&gt;\hat A(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Kubo formula then defines  the quantum-statistical calculation of the [[susceptibility (disambiguation)|susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi ( t -t' )&lt;/math&gt; by a general formula involving only the mentioned operators. &lt;!-- It is &lt;math&gt;\chi ( t -t' )= -(i/\hbar )\cdot \langle [\hat{A }(t-t' ),\hat B(0)]\rangle_{\text{thermal expectation}},&lt;/math&gt;  where the brackets mean the thermal expectation value, the expression [...&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;...] the quantum [[commutator]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat{A(t-t')}&lt;/math&gt; must be evaluated in the quantum-mechanical [[interaction picture]] with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_0.&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

As a consequence of the principle of [[Causality (physics)|causality]] the complex-valued function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi }(\omega )&lt;/math&gt; has poles only in the lower half-plane. This leads to the [[Kramers–Kronig relations]],  which relates the real  and the imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi }(\omega )&lt;/math&gt; by integration. The simplest example is once more the [[damped harmonic oscillator]].&lt;ref&gt;De Clozeaux,''Linear Response Theory'', in: E. Antončik et al., ''Theory of condensed matter'', IAEA Vienna, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''María Clara doctrine''', also known as the '''Woman's Honor doctrine''', is a [[legal doctrine]] applied by Philippine courts regarding cases that concerns [[Discrimination against women|abuse against women]].

==Etymology==
The doctrine was named after [[María Clara]] from [[José Rizal]]'s novel ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]''. Clara is characterized as reserved and shy and was later considered an "ideal" role model for women in Philippine culture.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patag|first1=Kristine Joy|title='SC has not abandoned ruling on Maria Clara doctrine'|url=http://old.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/21/1789994/sc-has-not-abandoned-ruling-maria-clara-doctrine|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=The Philippine Star|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal history==
The doctrine became a part of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]' [[jurisprudence]] sometime in 1960 following the ''People v. Taño'' case. The high court through Justice Alejo Labrador has asserted a "well known fact" that women, especially Filipinos "would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened."&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The court said that women's natural instict is to protect their honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawilan|first1=Christopher Lloyd|title=SC acquits 2 men of rape charges|agency=Philippine News Agency|url=http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1025868|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The case involved three armed robbers who the court found liable for [[gang rape|taking turns in raping]] a woman.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite news|last1=San Juan|first1=Joel|title=SC sets aside ‘woman’s honor’ doctrine in resolving rape cases|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/sc-sets-aside-womans-honor-doctrine-in-resolving-rape-cases/|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Business Mirror|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 58 years later since the doctrine entered the high court's jurisprudence, the Third Division of the Supreme Court reverse a ruling on January 17, 2018 by a Davao court on two people convicted of rape.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The 2018 decision was released in late-February.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Requejo|first1=Rey|title=High court drops 1960 doctrine in rape case|url=http://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/259208/high-court-drops-1960-doctrine-in-rape-case.html|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Manila Standard|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case involves an alleged rape that happened in 2009 and the two accused were sentenced of ''[[reclusión perpetua]]'', or forty years of imprisonment, in 2012. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 2016.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panaligan|first1=Rey|title=High Court abandons ‘woman’s honor’ doctrine in rape cases|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/02/20/high-court-abandons-womans-honor-doctrine-in-rape-cases/|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Manila Bulletin|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court described the doctrine as causing a "travesty of justice" by putting the accused at an "unfair disadvantage"&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt;, criticizing the doctrine for assuming that no Filipina woman of "decent repute" would falsely claim that she was abused. It urged for the acceptance of the "realities of a woman’s dynamic role" in Philippine society today so one can "evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without [[gender bias]] or cultural misconception". It also stated that the discrepancies in the alleged victim's testimonies had cast doubt on whether the rape incident did or did not happen.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

This has led to concerns and speculations that the high court has abandoned the doctrine.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt; The [[Gabriela Women's Party]] condemned the decision which it viewed made the Maria Clara doctrine invalid saying the ruling reversal will empower rapists and disagreed with the court's assessment of the societal status of women.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

On February 21, 2018, Supreme Court's spokesperson, Theodore Te has clarified that it was not the case since the high court can abandon a doctrine only during a full session.&lt;ref name="notabandoned"/&gt;

[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of [[mind/body dualism]].

Descartes believed inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the [[Pineal gland|epiphysis]] in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.&lt;ref name="Descartes1641"&gt;Descartes, R. (1641) ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', in ''The Philosophical Writings of René Descartes'', trans. by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D.

The '''mind''' is a set of [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties including [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], [[language]] and [[memory]]. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a lengthy tradition in [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]] about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.

One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the [[mind–body problem]], which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical [[brain]] and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older viewpoints included [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[idealism]], which considered the mind somehow non-physical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindware|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-982815-9|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, 10016|pages=14, 254–256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern views often center around [[physicalism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or [[Reductionism|reducible]] to physical phenomena such as [[neuron|neuronal activity]]&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C., "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/mind-identity/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of [[being]]s are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all [[animals]], by all [[life|living things]], whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of [[artificial intelligence|human-made machines]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] and [[intentionality]] towards their environment, to [[perceive]] and respond to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] with some kind of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], and to have consciousness, including thinking and [[feeling]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. [[panpsychism]] and [[animism]]), to animals and to [[deity|deities]]. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with [[soul]] or [[spirit]]) to theories concerning both [[life after death]], and [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] order, for example in the doctrines of [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], Plato, [[Aristotle]], and other ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and, later, [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic]] and medieval European philosophers.

Important philosophers of mind include [[Plato]], [[Patanjali]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], [[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]], and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/20-most-important-philosophers-of-mind-since-wwii.html | title=20 "Most Important" Philosophers of Mind since WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[William James|James]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] such as [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], which works closely in relation with [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The original meaning of [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gemynd|gemynd]]'' was the faculty of [[memory]], not of thought in general.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] had other words to express "mind", such as ''[[:wikt:hyge|hyge]]'' "mind, spirit".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The meaning of "memory" is shared with [[Old Norse]], which has ''[[Muninn|munr]]''. The word is originally from a [[PIE]] verbal root ''{{PIE|*men-}}'', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' [[:wikt:mens#Latin|mens]]'' "mind", Sanskrit ''[[:wikt:मनस्|{{IAST|manas}}]]'' "mind" and Greek [[:wikt:μένος|μένος]] "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the "higher" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Başar|first1=Erol|title=Brain body mind oscillations in scope of uncertainty principle|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1441961365|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAbMHo-ux58C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Some+psychologists+argue+that+only+the+%22higher%22+intellectual+functions+constitute+mind,+particularly+reason+and+memory#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20psychologists%20argue%20that%20only%20the%20%22higher%22%20intellectual%20functions%20constitute%20mind%2C%20particularly%20reason%20and%20memory&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the emotions — [[love]], [[hate]], [[fear]], and [[joy]] — are more ''primitive ''or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In popular usage, ''mind ''is frequently synonymous with ''thought'': the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Richard|last2=North|first2=Vanda|title=Mind Chi Re-wire Your Brain in 8 Minutes a Day ; Strategies for Success in Business and Life|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1907321375|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VCP63CWtVqIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=mind+is+frequently+synonymous+with+thought:#v=onepage&amp;q=mind%20is%20frequently%20synonymous%20with%20thought%3A&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we "make up our minds," "change our minds" or are "of two minds" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can "know our mind." They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Frances|title=Harness your Amazingly Creative Mind|url=http://www.thefusionmodel.com/harness-amazingly-creative-mind/|website=www.thefusionmodel.com|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental faculties==
{{See also|Nous|Reason|Modularity of mind|Mental process}}

Broadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can "do".

[[Thought]] is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the [[symbol]]ic or [[semiotic]] mediation of [[idea]]s or data, as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], reasoning, and making [[choice|decisions]]. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].

Thinking is sometimes described as a "higher" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.

[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]].

[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the "[[mind's eye]]". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to "see" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.

[[Consciousness]] in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Bl"&gt;Ned Block: "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

==Mental content==
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being "in" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===
[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.

==Relation to the brain==
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}

In animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "in the head"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&amp;nbsp;– [[mind–body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, W.D. (1997): [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dualism+%22The+mind-body+problem+is+the+question+how+the+mind+is+attached+to+the+body%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKuFTtvlNYSN4gTVrf20Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20%22The%20mind-body%20problem%20is%20the%20question%20how%20the%20mind%20is%20attached%20to%20the%20body%22&amp;f=false ‘Dualism’, pp. 265–267] in S. Guttenplan (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind''], Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name="DicPhil"&gt;A.R. Lacey, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name="DicPhil"/&gt;

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include [[connectionism]], [[computationalism]] and [[Bayesian brain]].

==Evolutionary history of the human mind==
The [[evolution of human intelligence]] refers to several theories that aim to describe how human [[intelligence]] has [[evolution|evolved]] in relation to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harnad, S.R., Steklis, H.D., &amp; Lancaster, J.E.|title=Origins and evolution of language and speech|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=280|issue=1|pages=1–2|date=1976|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25462.x|bibcode=1976NYASA.280....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline of [[human evolution]] spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' until the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus]]'', the following 2 million concern ''[[Australopithecus]]'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' species (the [[Paleolithic]]).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as [[empathy]], [[theory of mind]], [[mourning]], [[ritual]], and the use of [[Great ape language|symbols]] and [[tool]]s, are already apparent in [[great ape]]s although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "[[Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward]]" and those of a gradual or [[Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis]].

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* [[Robin Dunbar]]'s social brain hypothesis&lt;ref name="The Social Brain Hypothesis"&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe Social Brain Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121559/http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]]'s [[sexual selection]] hypothesis concerning [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC)&lt;ref name=flinn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf|title=Flinn, M.V., Geary, D.C., &amp; Ward, C.V. (2005).

Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]].
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The [[Group selection]] theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704000416 |title= Enhanced nutrition of offspring as a crucial factor for the evolution of intelligence on land |website= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.

==Philosophy of mind==
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the mind, [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body. The ''[[mind–body problem]]'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kim | first = J. | editor = Honderich, Ted | title = Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1998.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado]] writes, "In present popular usage, soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people, more or less consciously, still feel that the soul, and perhaps the mind, may enter or leave the body as independent entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James M.R. Delgado | title= Physical control of the mind; towards a psycho civilized society | page=25 | year=1969 | publisher=Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite book  | author = Plato |editor1=E.A.

(1996) "Dualism", in Samuel Guttenplan (org) ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind'', Blackwell, Oxford, 265–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&amp;nbsp;– or semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of&amp;nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally [[ontology|ontological]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-316-18065-8|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--find page # or page range for this citation--&gt; Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. About Behaviorism 1974, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; he considered the mind a "black box" and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism'', Chapter 7: Thinking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A thesis against which [[Noam Chomsky#Contributions to psychology|Noam Chomsky]] advanced a considerable polemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Chalmers]] has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Mind/body perspectives===
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not [[physiology|physiologically]] and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind-Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience|Thought identification}}

[[Neuroscience]] studies the [[nervous system]], the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. At a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.&lt;ref name="Spaun"/&gt; As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the [[hippocampus]] and [[limbic system]], hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with [[long-term memory]] and crude [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="CNRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computational Neuroscience Research Group|url=http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/|publisher=Waterloo Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[affective neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[emotion]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] primarily through experimental tasks.

===Cognitive Science===
{{See also|Cognitive Science}}
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}

[[Cognitive science]] examines the mental functions that give rise to [[information processing]], termed [[cognition]]. These include [[perception]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[long-term memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[reason]]ing, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking "in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures".&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Psyche (psychology)|label 2=Psyche|Unconscious mind}}

[[Psychology]] is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] discipline, Psychology involves the [[science|scientific study]] of [[mental process]]es such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and [[interpersonal relationships]], in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.

Psychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}

By analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "[[mental disorder]]" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

==Non-human minds==

===Animal intelligence===
[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].

===Artificial intelligence===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &amp;#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published "Computing machinery and intelligence" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".&lt;ref&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.

Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.

The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.

==In religion==
Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].

The [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vijñāna|Śūnyatā|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}

Buddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: "clarity and cognizes". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. "Clarity" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and "cognizes" that it functions to know or perceive objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.

Mind, in Buddhism, is also described as being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being "space and illusion" and being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.

Buddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.

In the same way, "mind" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is "Awareness", in Buddhism. "Mind" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term "mind". There is also not "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called "awareness" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called "awareness" and a third thing called "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to "no-self" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.

Clearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the "real experiencer of the experience" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)
# Body
# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)
# Mind,
# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)

To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).

===Mortality of the mind===
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Due to the [[mind–body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called "[[eternal oblivion]]". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]".

==In pseudoscience==
===Parapsychology===
[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis &lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

The term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.&lt;ref name = "EncyOccult"/&gt; [[J.B.

The '''Peripatetic axiom''' is: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses"  (Latin: "''Nihil est in intellectu quod non sit prius in sensu''"). It is found in [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''De veritate, q. 2 a. 3 arg. 19''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas |title=Quaestiones disputatae de veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas adopted this principle from the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] school of [[Greek philosophy]], established by [[Aristotle]]. Aquinas argued that the existence of God could be proved by reasoning from sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Leftow, Brian (ed., 2006), Aquinas: Summa Theologiae, Questions on God, pp. vii et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a variation on the Aristotelian notion of the "[[active intellect]]" ("intellectus agens")&lt;ref&gt;Z. Kuksewicz, “The Potential and the Agent Intellect,” in: N. Kretzmann, e.a., ''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 595-601&lt;/ref&gt; which he interpreted as the ability to abstract universal meanings from particular empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Thomas Aquinas", subsection on "Theory of Knowledge", vol. 8, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1398">'''Personality pathology''' refers to enduring patterns of cognition, emotion, and behavior that negatively affect a person's adaptation. In [[psychiatry]] and [[clinical psychology]], it is characterized by adaptive inflexibility, vicious cycles of maladaptive behavior, and emotional instability under stress. In the United States and elsewhere, [[personality disorders]] are diagnosed categorically on [[Axis II (psychology)|Axis II]] of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">[[File:Point of view bias.jpg|thumb|Point of view. Two people are looking at the same object and interpreting it differently due to a different point of view]]
In [[philosophy]], a '''point of view''' is a specified or stated manner of consideration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"], Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  an attitude how one sees or thinks of something,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"] The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as in "from my personal point of view". This figurative usage of the expression as attested since 1760.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view."] Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In this meaning, the usage is synonymous with one of the meanings of the term '''perspective'''.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMPS14 /&gt;

==Analysis==
Margarita Vázquez Campos and Antonio Manuel Liz Gutiérrez in their work, "The Notion of Point of View", give a comprehensive analysis of the structure of the concept. They point out that despite being crucial in many discourses, the notion has not been adequately analyzed, though some important works do exist.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt; They mention that early classical Greek philosophers, starting from [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]] discussed the relation between "appearance" and reality, i.e., how our points of view are connected with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos-Gutiérrez, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They specifically point out [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s  ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. They consider Wittgenstein's theory of "pictures" or "models" (Wittgenstein used the German word ''Bild'', which means both "picture" and "model") as an illustration of the relationship between points of view and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "point of view" is highly multifunctional and ambiguous. Many things may be judged from certain personal, traditional or moral points of view (as in "the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). Our knowledge about reality is often relative to a certain point of view.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt;

Vázquez Campos and Manuel Liz Gutierrez suggested to analyse the concept of "point of view" using two approaches: one based on the concept of "[[propositional attitude]]s", the other on the concepts of "location" and "access".&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Liz, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propositional attitudes===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed similarly to the concept of a  propositional attitude. A propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Examples of such attitudes are "to believe in something", "to desire something", "to guess something", "to remember something", etc. Vazques Campos and Gutierrez  suggest that points of view may be analyzed as structured sets of propositional attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The authors draw on [[Christopher Peacocke]]'s ''Sense and Content''.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

Within this approach one may carry out [[ontology|ontological]] classification of various distinctions, such as individual vs. collective points of view, personal vs. non-personal,  non-conceptual vs. conceptual, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14&gt;Manuel Liz &amp; Margarita Vázquez, [https://www.academia.edu/913996/C2._Cognitive_Science_Two_approaches_to_the_notion_of_Point_of_View_Manuel_Liz_and_Margarita_V%C3%A1zquez "Two approaches to the notion of Point of View"], extended abstract for: [http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf ''14th Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920152028/http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-09-20 }}, July 19–26, 2011 (retrieved August 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and access===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Privileged access|Emic and etic}}
Whereas propositional attitudes approach is to analyze points of view internally, the "location/access" approach analyzes points of view externally, by their role. The term "access" refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that "points of views, or perspectives, are ways of having access to the world and to ourselves", and the term "location" is in reference to the provided quotation of [[Jon Moline]] that points of view are "ways of viewing things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion that points of view are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of "location" in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Jon, "On Points of View", American Philosophical Quarterly, 1968, vol. 5, 191–298. (as cited by Manuel Liz)&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach may address [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues, such as [[relativism]], existence of the absolute point of view, compatibility of points of view (including "[[faultless disagreement]]"), possibility of a point of view without a bearer, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

'''Political freedom''' (also known as '''political autonomy''' or '''political agency''') is a central [[concept]] in history and political thought and one of the most important features of [[Democracy|democratic]] societies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", ''Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought'', (New York: Penguin, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression&lt;ref&gt;Iris Marion Young, "Five Faces of Oppression", ''Justice and the Politics of Difference" (Princeton University press, 1990), 39–65.&lt;/ref&gt; or coercion,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Development as Freedom'' (Anchor Books, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]], "Alienated Labour" in ''Early Writings''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although political freedom is often interpreted [[Negative liberty|negatively]] as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action,&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''Liberty'' (Oxford 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; it can also refer to the [[positive liberty|positive]] exercise of rights, [[Capability approach|capacities]] and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "What's Wrong With Negative Liberty?", ''Philosophy and the Human Sciences: Philosophical Papers'' (Cambridge, 1985), 211–229.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social [[conformity]], consistency, or inauthentic behaviour).&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, "[http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm Self-Reliance]"; Nikolas Kompridis, "Struggling Over the Meaning of Recognition: A Matter of Identity, Justice or Freedom?" in ''European Journal of Political Theory'' July 2007 vol. 6 no. 3 pp. 277–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]], which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the [[State (polity)|state]].

== Views ==
Various groups along the [[political spectrum]] naturally differ on what they believe constitutes true political freedom.

[[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of [[positive liberty]], or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.

[[Classical liberalism|Classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] criticized this as a misconception of freedom: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he use of "liberty" to describe the physical "ability to do what I want", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich August von Hayek, "Freedom and Coercion" in David Miller (ed), ''Liberty'' (1991) pp. 80, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Social anarchism|Anarcho-socialists]] see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by [[Right Libertarianism|capitalism]] as "selfish freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/faq/sp001547/secF2.html#secf22 "Anarchism FAQ"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalists]] see negative rights as a consistent system. [[Ayn Rand]] described it as "a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Some notable philosophers, such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, "The Virtues of Acknowledged Dependence", ''Rational Dependent Animals: Why Humans Need the Virtues'' (Open Court, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', American economist [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and [[economic freedom]]. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by [[Robin Hahnel]] in his article "Why the Market Subverts Democracy". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman’s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system—which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahnel|first=R.|date=2009-03-01|title=Why the Market Subverts Democracy|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0002764208327672|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=52|issue=7|pages=1006–1022|doi=10.1177/0002764208327672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitalism and Freedom|last=Friedman|first=Milton|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to political philosopher [[Nikolas Kompridis]], the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as [[autonomy]] or [[independence]] and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom" in ''Philosophical Romanticism'' (New York: Routledge, 2007), 32-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "The Subject and Power" in Paul Rabinow and Nikolas S. Rose, eds., ''The Essential Foucault''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Jacques Rancière]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

[[Environmentalist]]s often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of [[ecosystem]]s. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create [[negative externalities]], which violates other groups' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, [[golf]] and [[urban sprawl]] has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and [[ecological conservation]] can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of [[PETA]] regarding [[fur]].

[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|John Dalberg-Acton]] stated: "The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Freedom and Other Essays|edition=|last=Acton|first=John D.|year=1907|publisher= Macmillan|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald C. MacCallum Jr.]] spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacCallum|first=Gerald|date=July 1967|title=Negative and Positive Freedom|url=http://mcv.planc.ee/misc/doc/filosoofia/artiklid/Gerald%20MacCallum%20-%20Negative%20and%20Positive%20Freedom.pdf|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hannah Arendt]] traces freedom's conceptual origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] politics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of [[free will|freedom of the will]], or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is "the raison d'être of politics".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", ''Between Past and Future: Eight exercises in political thought'' (New York: Penguin, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Arendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to [[sovereignty]] or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to "begin anew", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as "new beginnings and hence beginners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25458723|title=On revolution|last=Hannah|first=Arendt|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1965|isbn=9780140184211|edition=Reprinted|location=London|pages=211|oclc=25458723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of "the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11404">The '''pre-existing duty rule''' is an aspect of [[consideration]] within the law of [[contract]]. Originating in [[English Law|England]] (the  world's quintessential [[common law]] jurisdiction) the concept of consideration has been adopted by other jurisdictions, including the US.

In essence, this rule declares that performance of a pre-existing duty does not amount to good consideration to support a valid contract; but there are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Wigan v Edwards''(1973) 1 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 497; 47 [[Australian Law Journal Reports|ALJR]] 586. See also  {{cite web |author=Walker, Janet N. |title=''Wigan v Edwards''  |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/1974/9.html}} (1974) 9(3) Melbourne University Law Review 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Rule ==
English law recognises bargains supported by consideration, not bare promises.  However, only simple contracts need consideration to be enforceable; special contracts do not require consideration. 

''[[Currie v Misa]]'' (1875)  &lt;ref&gt;''Currie v Misa'' (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893&lt;/ref&gt; declares that consideration may comprise any of these positive and negative matters: 
* Right,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit
* Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  or Responsibility"
===The basic rule===
The leading case is ''[[Stilk v Myrick]]'' (1809), &lt;ref&gt;''Stilk v Myrick'' (1809)  2 Camp 317&lt;/ref&gt; where a captain promised 8 crew the wages of 2 deserters provided the remainers completed the voyage. The shipowner refused to honour the agreement; the court deemed the 8 crew were unable to enforce the deal as they had an existing obligation to sail the ship and meet "ordinary foreseeable emergencies".

However, in two cases the courts held that a claimant provides good consideration provided they act "above and beyond" their contractual obligation:
* In ''[[Hartley v Ponsonby]]'' (1857)&lt;ref&gt;''Hartley v Ponsonby'' (1857)  7 E&amp;B 872&lt;/ref&gt;, crew who were promised a bonus after HALF the complement deserted could enforce the promise of a bonus; and
* In ''[[Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC]]'' [1925]  &lt;ref&gt;''Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC'' [1925] AC 270&lt;/ref&gt;, the police, who had been asked to protect a colliery from vandalism during a strike could reek recompense from the mine-owners.

===Issues of "public policy"===
The rule may be affected by issues of [[public policy]],&lt;ref&gt;This is the public policy of the courts, i.e what the court considers a "good thing" or a "bad thing"&lt;/ref&gt; as in:
''[[Collins v Godefroy]]'' (1831) &lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Godefroy'' 	(1831)  1 B&amp; Ad. 950&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[England v Davidson]]'' (1840)  &lt;ref&gt;''England v Davidson'' (1840)11 A7E 856&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Williams v Williams]]'' [1957]  &lt;ref&gt;''Williams v Williams'' 	[1957] 1 WLR 148&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Collins v Godefroy]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Godefroy'' [https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/collins-v-godefroy.phphttps://www.lawteacher.net/cases/collins-v-godefroy.php]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[subpoena]]'d witness to whom the defendant promised a guinea per day as "attendance money could not enforce the agreement; the witness had an existing duty to attend and it would be contrary to public policy to permit such payments. After all, one might then contemplate paying witness not to appear!
*In ''[[England v Davidson]]'' &lt;ref&gt; ''England v Davidson'' [https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/contract-law/law-of-obligations.php]&lt;/ref&gt; a policeman was allowed to claim a reward for offering information leading to a criminal's capture; it was  held to be "in the interest of justice".
* In ''[[Williams v Williams]]'', where a husband promised his estranged wife an allowance if she did not "pledge his credit",&lt;ref&gt;Being estranged and separated, the wife now had a legal duty NOT to charge any expenditure to her husband's account.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]] held the promise was enforceable as it was "not contrary to public policy:".

===Issues of "Benefit"===
The court may also be happy to enforce an agreement provided that is gives benefit:
* In ''[[Ward v Byham]]'' [1956] &lt;ref&gt;''Ward v Byham'' [1956]1 WLR 496 Court of Appeal&lt;/ref&gt; an unmarried couple with a child separated after 5 years. The husband promised to pay the mother  £1 per week provided she ensured the child was well looked after and happy. The Court held that (although she had an existing duty to care) the promise was enforceable as being in there public interest.&lt;ref&gt;The court added that the mother had gone beyond her existing duty, but there is little evidence of that.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In  ''[[Williams v Roffey]]'' [1990] &lt;ref&gt;''Williams v Roffey''[1990] 2 WLR 1153&lt;/ref&gt; a contractor subcontracted joinery work for an agreed price of £20,000. (The main contract with the client included a [[liquidated damages|penalty clause]] for delay). The joiner ran out of funds and was heading for bankruptcy, so he asked the contractor for an extra amount, some of which was reluctantly paid. The job was finished on time, but the contractor refused to pay the final sum.  The court held that the revised agreement was enforceable and the contractor, by promising the extra cash, had received the valuable benefit of being free of penalties and possible problems with a new subcontractor.&lt;ref&gt;The moral of this case is that a contractor should not automatically award a subcontract to the lowest tender; he should have an idea of what a realistic tender should be.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v Roffey'' was severely criticised in ''[[Re Selectmove ]]''	[1993] 1 WLR 474&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical issues ==
Any contracting party cannot who wished to amend the agreement must provide new consideration. This situatiation typically usually arises in any of three different ways:

* '''Pay less'''
If one party has performed their part of the contract, but the other party refuses to pay unless the amount owed is reduced, the full amount remains payable: ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602). Any attempt to use [[promissory estoppel]] will fail if the debtor behaves inequitably: ''[[D&amp;C Builders v Rees]]''[1966]&lt;ref&gt;''D&amp;C Builders v Rees'' [1966] CA 2 QB 617&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pay more'''
One party refuses to perform her side of the contract unless a larger sum of money is paid.&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v Roffey''[1990] 2 WLR 1153&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Christine agrees to sell Julian a set of textbooks for $300. Julian wires $300 to his friend Jake, who is charged with picking up the textbooks and delivering the $300. After the money has been wired and delivery arrangements have been made, Christine calls Julian and states that she has changed the price to $350 and will not deliver the books to Jake unless Julian promises to pay an additional $50. The rule will apply so Julian could agree to pay the extra money but then not do so when the books are delivered.  (If Julian actually paid the extra money, he could sue later under "duress" to recover the $50.)

* '''Public duty'''
The party seeking payment already has a public duty to perform the act. For example, a government employee polygraph expert might ask a criminal about an unrelated crime during the administration of a polygraph. If the criminal admits to the crime and the employee then seeks a reward for identifying the perpetrator, he would not be entitled to it under the legal duty rule because he already has a public duty to find out about crimes.&lt;ref&gt; But see ''[[England v Davidson]]'', which says the opposite.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions ==
The legal duty rule does not apply if the parties mutually agree to change the terms of the contract.  For example, the homeowner and contractor could agree to modify their contract to include a new window for the bathroom at an additional cost of $1000. Alternatively, the parties could agree not to perform part of the contract for a $500 reduction in the price. Both modifications to the original contract would be enforceable because there was consideration for each.&lt;ref&gt;Contracts: Cases and Commentaries: Boyle and Percy&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal duty rule protects one party when the other is trying to unilaterally change the terms of the agreement.

There are ways around the legal duty rule, such as mutual [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the existing contract with a clear indication of such rescission (literally tearing up the old contract). Also, in some states, parties may renegotiate [[contracts]] to include additional benefits if, for example, the party performs unexpected or additional duties, the parties assent in [[good faith]], or a new contract is agreed.

If contractual parties owe each other existing contractual obligations but a third party offers a promise contingent upon performance of the contract, that promise has sufficient consideration.

Consideration will be found if a party promises to perform where there are unforeseen and/or unforeseeable circumstances sufficient to discharge the party from the obligation if any new or different consideration is promised (earlier payment or payment in stock), the promise is to ratify a voidable obligation (such as to go through despite fraud), the preexisting duty is owed to another person, and there is an honest dispute as to the duty.

Also, under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], modifications may be made free of the [[Common Law]] legal duty rule even without consideration provided that the modification is made in good faith.  See UCC § 2-209.&lt;ref&gt;UCC [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-209]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UCC [http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2582&amp;context=vlr]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]] must be complied with. Thus, a written contract is necessary if the contract as modified comes within the scope of that statute.  For purposes of the UCC, a contract must be in writing if it is for the sale of goods where the price exceeds $500.  UCC § 2-201.&lt;ref&gt;UCC [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-201]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-existing duty rule has been abrogated under the ''Restatement, Second of Contracts § 89'', which does not require independent consideration if the parties mutually and voluntarily agree to the modification (see ''[[Angel v. Murray]]'' for an early application of the Restatement).&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, I. &amp; Speidel, R.E. ''Studies in Contract Law, Seventh Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York: 2008, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The restatement, however, will not always be followed, as evidenced by the decision in ''[[Labriola v. Pollard Group, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime salvage==
The pre-existing duty rule plays a part in [[marine salvage|salvage]] which is a "voluntary successful service to save maritime property in danger at sea".&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Law - Aleka Mandaraka Sheppard&lt;/ref&gt; The service must be "voluntary", which in this context means that the salvor must not have an existing duty towards the ship.  Generally, a ship's crew cannot claim salvage unless (i) they have been ordered to abandon ship (so that their contract of employment has ended), ''[[San Demetrio|The San Demetrio]]'' (1941);&lt;ref&gt;''The San Demetrio'' 69 LLR 5&lt;/ref&gt; or (ii) the crew act over and beyond their normal duty to look after the safety of the ship, ''[[HMS Beaver|The Beaver]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;''The Beaver'' (1800) 3  Ch R 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''presumption of innocence''' is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. It was traditionally expressed by the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin maxim]] ''ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat'' (“the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies”).

In many [[State (polity)|states]], presumption of innocence is a [[legal right]] of the accused in a [[criminal trial]], and it is an international [[human right]] under the [[UN]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of innocence, the [[legal burden of proof]] is thus on the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]], which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. The trier of fact (a judge or a jury)  is thus restrained and ordered by law to consider only actual evidence and testimony presented in court. The prosecution must, in most cases prove that the accused is [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] beyond [[reasonable doubt]]. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be [[Acquittal|acquitted]].

Under the [[Justinian Codes]] and [[English common law]], the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings, and in civil proceedings (like [[breach of contract]]) both sides must issue proof. 

== History ==

=== Roman law ===
The sixth century [[Digest_(Roman_law)|''Digest'']] of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (22.3.2) provides, as a general rule of evidence: ''Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-22.htm |title=Digesta seu Pandectae 22.3.2 |location=Grenoble |publisher=Université Pierre-Mendés-France |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}"Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him  who denies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Alan |editor-last=Watson |editor-link=Alan Watson (legal scholar) |title=The Digest of Justinian |year=1998 |origyear=1985 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-8122-1636-9 |section=22.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is there attributed to the second and third century jurist [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paul]]. It was introduced in Roman criminal law by emperor [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 527"&gt;See Bury, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
Similar to that of Roman Law, Islamic law also holds the principle that the onus of proof is on the accuser or claimant based on a [[hadith]] documented by [[Al-Nawawi|Imam Nawawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Imam Nawawi. 1977. ''An-Nawawi’s Forty Hadith (Second Edition English Translation by Ezzedin Ibrahim)''. Damascus: Holy Koran Pub. House, Hadith No. 33&lt;/ref&gt; 'Suspicion' is also highly condemned, this also from a hadith documented by Imam Nawawi&lt;ref&gt;Riyaadus Shaaliheen, Hadith No. 1573&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Imam Bukhari]]&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari (English Version), Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 90&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim (English Version), Book 32, Hadith 6214&lt;/ref&gt;

After the time of [[Muhammad]], the fourth [[Caliph]] [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Thalib]] has also been cited to say 'Avert the prescribed punishment by rejecting doubtful evidence.'&lt;ref&gt;Imam ibn Hajar's Bulugh al-Maram (English Version), Book 10, Hadith 1260&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages in Europe ===

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe fell back on [[Feudalism|feudal]] law. This included some [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] customs, including presumed guilt. The accused could prove his innocence by having, for example, twelve people swear that he could not have done what he was accused of. This tended to favor the nobility over the lower classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.thefinertimes.com/Middle-Ages/law-in-the-middle-ages.html |title=Law in the Middle Ages |publisher=The Finer Times |accessdate=January 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil law ===
The maxim or its equivalent has been adopted by many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, including [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/del3689.htm Decree-Law 3689|date=August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/lawsdata/chineselaw/200211/20021100053376.html CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA|date=August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;[[France]],&lt;ref name="CPPprelim"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=19C04F150E579BCAE87BE5E6305FF5F5.tpdjo03v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574771&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20110106 Code de procédure pénale, article préliminaire] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foroeuropeo.it/latino/latino.htm |title=ForoEuropo Italia |publisher=Foroeuropeo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611152854/http://www.foroeuropeo.it/latino/latino.htm |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assomedici.it/Doc/OnereProva.htm |title=Assomedici.It |publisher=Assomedici.It |date=1993-01-29 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1998/dec1998/124329.htm People vs. Masalihit, decision of the Supreme Court of The Philippines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120820/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1998/dec1998/124329.htm |date=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infoportal.fra.europa.eu/InfoPortal/infobaseShowContent.do?btnCat_320&amp;btnCountryBread_189 |title=National Constitutional Law Related to Article 48 – Presumption of Innocence and Right to Defence |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711025000/http://infoportal.fra.europa.eu/InfoPortal/infobaseShowContent.do?btnCat_320&amp;btnCountryBread_189 |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=2#t2c2s0a23 |title=Constitution of Romania, Article 23 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Valentin Anders |url=http://latin.dechile.net/?Juridico=1 |title=Latin legal maxims in Spanish |publisher=Latin.dechile.net |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:William Garrow2.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[William Garrow]] coined the phrase "presumed innocent until proven guilty", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court]]

"Presumption of innocence" serves to emphasize that the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt (or some other level of proof depending on the criminal justice system) and that the accused bears no burden of proof.&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Mueller, Christopher B. |author2=Laird C. Kirkpatrick |title=Evidence; 4th ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Aspen (Wolters Kluwer) |isbn=978-0-7355-7968-2}} pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often expressed in the phrase ''innocent until proven guilty'', coined by the English lawyer [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] (1760–1840).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Christopher|title=The Law Society of Upper Canada and Ontario's lawyers, 1797–1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8020-4127-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrow insisted that accusers be robustly tested in court. An objective observer in the position of the juror must reasonably conclude that the defendant almost certainly committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of the Land |last=Rembar |first=Charles |year=1980 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page=&lt;!-- needed --&gt; |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption of innocence was originally expressed by the French cardinal and jurist [[Jean Lemoine]] in the phrase "''item quilbet presumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens'' (a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty)", based on the legal inference that most people are not criminals.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;''Words and Phrases'' 1914, p. 1168&lt;/ref&gt; However, this referred not merely to the fact that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution in a criminal case, but the protections which a defendant should be given-prior [[notice]] of the accusation being made against them, the [[right of confrontation]], [[right to counsel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.edu/scholar/172/ Innocent Until Proven Guilty: The Origins of a Legal Maxim] Kenneth Pennington A Ennio Cortese (3 Volumes. Roma: Il Cigno Galileo Galilei Edizioni, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is literally considered favorable evidence for the accused that automatically attaches at trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coffin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|156|432|1895}} “the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in [their] behalf”&lt;/ref&gt; It requires that the [[trier of fact]], be it a juror or judge, begin with the presumption that the state is unable to support its assertion.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; To ensure this legal protection is maintained a set of three related rules govern the procedure of criminal trials.  The presumption means:&lt;ref name="Mueller"/&gt;

#With respect to the critical facts of the case—whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant was the person who committed the crime—the state has the entire burden of proof.
#With respect to the critical facts of the case, the defendant does not have any burden of proof whatsoever. The defendant does not have to testify, call witnesses or present any other evidence, and if the defendant elects not to testify or present evidence, this decision cannot be used against them.
#The jury or judge is not to draw any negative inferences from the fact the defendant has been charged with a crime and is present in court and represented by an attorney. They must decide the case solely on evidence presented during the trial.

This duty on the prosecution was famously referred to as the “golden thread” in the criminal law by [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Lord Sankey]] [[Lord Chancellor|LC]] in ''[[Woolmington v DPP]]'':
{{bquote|Throughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen—that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception...}}

==The fundamental right==
This right is so important in modern [[democracy|democracies]], [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and [[republic]]s that many have explicitly included it in their legal codes and constitutions:

* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 11, states: "Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.".
* The [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] of the [[Council of Europe]] says (art. 6.2): "Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law". This convention has been adopted by [[treaty]] and is binding on all Council of Europe members. Currently (and in any foreseeable expansion of the EU) every country member of the [[European Union]] is also member to the Council of Europe, so this stands for EU members as a matter of course. Nevertheless, this assertion is iterated ''verbatim'' in Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].
* In [[Canada]], [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] states: "Any person charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal".
* In the [[Constitution of Colombia|Colombian constitution]], Title II, Chapter 1, Article 29 states that "Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law".
* In [[France]], article 9 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] 1789, which has force as [[constitution]]al law, begins:  "Any man being presumed innocent until he has been declared guilty ...".  The Code of Criminal Procedure states in its preliminary article that "any person suspected or prosecuted is presumed innocent for as long as their guilt has not been established"&lt;ref name="CPPprelim" /&gt; and the [[Jury|jurors']] oath repeats this assertion (article 304).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=323BC6F257637C73CC209B436A9FDD7D.tpdjo03v_1?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006167464&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20110106 Code de procédure pénale, article 304] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists a popular misconception that under French law, the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Michael H.|title=French Law Presumes Accused Innocent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/opinion/l-french-law-presumes-accused-innocent-814392.html|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=23 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Iran]], Article 37 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] states: "Innocence is to be presumed, and no one is to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court".
* In [[Italy]], the second paragraph of Article 27 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] states: "A defendant shall be considered not guilty until a final sentence has been passed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Romania, article 23 of the [[Constitution of Romania|Constitution]] states that "any person shall be presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court."
* The [[Constitution of Russia]], in article 49, states that "Everyone charged with a crime shall be considered not guilty until his or her guilt has been proven in conformity with the federal law and has been established by the valid sentence of a court of law". It also states that "The defendant shall not be obliged to prove his or her innocence" and "Any reasonable doubt shall be interpreted in favor of the defendant".
* In the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa|South African Constitution]], section 35(3)''(h)'' of the [[Bill of Rights of South Africa|Bill of Rights]] states: "Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be presumed innocent, to remain silent, and not to testify during the proceedings."
* Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments. The case of ''[[Coffin v. United States]]'' (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also ''[[In re Winship]].''
* In [[New Zealand]], the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990]] provides inter alia at section 25 (c) "Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination of the charge, the following minimum rights: (c) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225527.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 25 Minimum standards of criminal procedure – New Zealand Legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern practices==
[[File:07CFREU-Article48.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the right to the presumption of innocence]]
In the [[United Kingdom]] changes have been made affecting this principle. Defendants' previous convictions may in certain circumstances be revealed to juries. Although the suspect is not compelled to answer questions after formal arrest, failure to give information may now be prejudicial at trial. Statute law also exists which provides for criminal penalties for failing to decrypt data on request from the Police. If the suspect is unwilling to do so, it is an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1 |title=OPSI.gov.uk |publisher=OPSI.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens can therefore be convicted and imprisoned without any evidence that the encrypted material was unlawful. Furthermore, in sexual offence cases such as rape, where the sexual act has already been proved beyond reasonable doubt, there are a limited number of circumstances where the defendant has an obligation to adduce evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual act, or that the defendant reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting.  These circumstances include, for example, where the complainant was unconscious, unlawfully detained, or subjected to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 |title=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">'''Psychomotor learning''' is the relationship between [[cognitive functions]] and [[kinesiology|physical movement]]. Psychomotor learning is demonstrated by physical skills such as movement, coordination, manipulation, dexterity, grace, strength, speed—actions which demonstrate the fine motor skills, such as use of precision instruments or tools.

[[Behavioral]] examples include driving a car, throwing a ball, and playing a [[musical instrument]].  In psychomotor learning [[research]], attention is given to the learning of [[motor coordination|coordinated]] activity involving the arms, hands, fingers, and feet, while verbal processes are not emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/psychomotor-learning|title=Psychomotor learning|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of psychomotor development==
When learning psychomotor skills, individuals progress through the [[cognitive]] stages, the [[Association (psychology)|associative]] stage, and the [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] stage.  The cognitive stage is marked by awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control.  The learner has to think about each movement before attempting it. In the associative stage, the learner spends less time thinking about every detail, however, the movements are still not a permanent part of the [[brain]]. In the autonomic stage, the learner can refine the skill through practice, but no longer needs to think about the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essortment.com/all/psychomotordeve_pqs.htm |title=Psychomotor development and learning.Ada taik2 bintik2 |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2012-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512184538/http://www.essortment.com/all/psychomotordeve_pqs.htm |archivedate=2010-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors affecting psychomotor skills===
*Psychological feedback
*Amount of practice
*Task complexity
*Work distribution
*Motive-incentive conditions 
*Environmental factors

==How motor behaviors are recorded==
When an individual learns physical movements, this leads to changes in the [[motor cortex]].  The more practiced a movement is, the stronger the neural encoding becomes.  Psychomotor learning is not limited to the motor cortex, however.

In [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], the '''Reissner&amp;ndash;Nordström metric''' is a [[Static spacetime|static solution]] to the [[Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell field equations]], which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass ''M''.

The metric was discovered by [[Hans Reissner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reissner | first=H. | date=1916 | title=''Über die Eigengravitation des elektrischen Feldes nach der Einsteinschen Theorie'' | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=50 | pages=106–120 | doi=10.1002/andp.19163550905 | bibcode=1916AnP...355..106R | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weyl | first=H. | date=1917 | title=''Zur Gravitationstheorie'' | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=54 | pages=117–145 | doi=10.1002/andp.19173591804  | language=German| bibcode=1917AnP...359..117W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gunnar Nordström]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nordström | first=G. | date=1918 | title=''On the Energy of the Gravitational Field in Einstein's Theory'' | journal=Verhandl. Koninkl. Ned. Akad. Wetenschap., Afdel. Natuurk., Amsterdam | volume=26 | pages=1201–1208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Barker Jeffery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jeffery | first=G. B. | date=1921 | title=''The field of an electron on Einstein’s theory of gravitation'' | journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A | volume=99 | pages=123–134 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1921.0028 | bibcode=1921RSPSA..99..123J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The metric==
In [[spherical coordinates]] (''t'', ''r'', θ, φ), the [[line element]] for the Reissner&amp;ndash;Nordström metric is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm d}s^2 = 
\left( 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2} \right) c^2\, {\rm d}t^2 -\left( 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2} \right)^{-1} {\rm d}r^2 - r^2\, {\rm d}\Omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''t'' is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity), ''r'' is the radial coordinate, d''Ω''² is a 2-sphere defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm d}\Omega^2={\rm d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \ {\rm d}\phi^2
&lt;/math&gt;

''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the body given by
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{\rm s} = \frac{2GM}{c^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
and ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a characteristic length scale given by
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{\rm Q}^{2} = \frac{Q^2 G}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0} c^4}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here 1/4πε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant|Coulomb force constant]] ''K''.

The total mass of the central body and its irreducible mass are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], S. 11 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quadir"&gt;Ashgar Quadir: ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PhLA...99..419Q The Reissner Nordström Repulsion]''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr}= \frac{c^2}{G} \sqrt{\frac{r_{+}^2}{2}} \ \to \ M=\frac{Q ^2 K}{4 G M_{\rm irr}}+M_{\rm irr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The difference between ''M'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]], which makes the [[Electric field#Energy in the electric field|electric field energy]] also contribute to the total mass.

In the limit that the charge ''Q'' (or equivalently, the length-scale ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, one recovers the [[Schwarzschild metric]].  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' goes to zero. In that limit that both ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''/''r'' and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' go to zero, the metric becomes the [[Minkowski metric]] for [[special relativity]].

In practice, the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''r'' is often extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the [[Earth]] is roughly 9&amp;nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]] (3/8&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]), whereas a [[satellite]] in a [[geosynchronous orbit]] has a radius ''r'' that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer|km]] (26,200&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s).  Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to [[black hole]]s and other ultra-dense objects such as [[neutron star]]s.

==Charged black holes==
Although charged black holes with ''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≪ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are similar to the [[Schwarzschild black hole]], they have two horizons: the [[event horizon]] and an internal [[Cauchy horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |authorlink=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar |title=The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes |date=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19850370-9 |edition=Reprinted |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/Relativity/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198503705 |accessdate=13 May 2013 |page=205 |quote=And finally, the fact that the Reissner–Nordström solution has two horizons, an external event horizon and an internal 'Cauchy horizon,' provides a convenient bridge to the study of the Kerr solution in the subsequent chapters. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429125834/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/Relativity/?view=usa |archivedate=29 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component ''g&lt;sup&gt;rr&lt;/sup&gt;'' diverges; that is, where

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \frac{1}{g^{rr}} = 1 - \frac{r_{\rm s}}{r} + \frac{r_{\rm Q}^2}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(r_{\rm s} \pm \sqrt{r_{\rm s}^2 - 4r_{\rm Q}^2}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

These concentric [[event horizon]]s become [[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]] for 2''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;= ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds to an [[extremal black hole]]. Black holes with 2''r&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; can not exist in nature because if the charge is greater than the mass there can be no physical event horizon&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;Andrew Hamilton: ''[http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/rn.html The Reissner Nordström Geometry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707053358/http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/rn.html |date=2007-07-07 }}'' (Casa Colorado)&lt;/ref&gt; (the term under the square root becomes negative).  Objects with a charge greater than their mass can exist in nature, but they can not collapse down to a black hole, and if they could, they would display a [[naked singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brandon Carter|Carter, Brandon]].  [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v174/i5/p1559_1 ''Global Structure of the Kerr Family of Gravitational Fields'',] ''Physical Review'', page 174&lt;/ref&gt; Theories with [[supersymmetry]] usually guarantee that such "superextremal" black holes cannot exist.

The [[electromagnetic potential]] is

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha} = \left(Q/r, 0, 0, 0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge ''P'' is obtained by replacing ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the metric and including the term ''P''cos&amp;thinsp;θ&amp;nbsp;''dφ'' in the electromagnetic potential.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}

== Gravitational time dilation ==

The [[gravitational time dilation]] in the vicinity of the central body is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varsigma = \sqrt{|g^{t t}|} = \sqrt{\frac{r^2}{Q^2+(r-2 M) r}}&lt;/math&gt;

which relates to the local radial escape-velocity of a neutral particle

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm esc}=\frac{\sqrt{\varsigma^2-1}}{\varsigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Christoffel symbols ==

The [[Christoffel symbols]]

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{j k} = \sum_{s=0}^3 \ \frac{g^{is}}{2} \left(\frac{\partial g_{js}}{\partial x^k}+\frac{\partial g_{sk}}{\partial x^j}-\frac{\partial g_{jk}}{\partial x^s}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with the indicies

:&lt;math&gt;\{ 0, \ 1, \ 2, \ 3 \} \to \{ t, \ r, \ \theta, \ \phi \}&lt;/math&gt;

give the nonvanishing expressions

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^0_{1 0} = \frac{M r+Q^2}{r \left(r (r-2 M)-Q^2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{0 0} = \frac{\left(M r+Q^2\right) \left(r (2 M-r)+Q^2\right)}{r^5}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{1 1} = \frac{M r+Q^2}{2 M r^2+Q^2 r-r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{2 2} = 2 M-\frac{Q^2}{r}+r&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^1_{3 3} = \frac{\sin ^2 \theta \left(r (r-2 M)-Q^2\right)}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2_{2 1} = r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2_{3 3} = - \sin \theta \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^3_{3 1} = r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^3_{3 2} = \cot \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Given the Christoffel symbols, one can compute the geodesics of a test-particle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Susskind]]: [http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall/lecture-4 ''The Theoretical Minimum: Geodesics and Gravity''], (''General Relativity Lecture 4'', timestamp: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdnLcYNdTzE&amp;t=34m18s&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL9peWTxCcrBLLE89-Pwab3Qc1uoaKEH0e 34m18s])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hackmann, Hongxiao Xu: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2142.pdf#page=4 ''Charged particle motion in Kerr–Newmann space-times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations of motion ==

Because of the [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherical symmetry]] of the metric, the coordinate system can always be aligned in a way that the motion of a test-particle is confined to a plane, so for brevity and without restriction of generality we further use ''Ω'' instead of ''θ'' and ''φ''. In dimensionless natural units of ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 the motion of an electrically charged particle with the charge ''q'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot x^i = - \sum_{j=0}^3 \ \sum_{k=0}^3 \ \Gamma^i_{j k} \ {\dot x^j} \ {\dot x^k} + q \ {F^{i k}} \ {\dot x_k} &lt;/math&gt;

which gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot t = \frac{\dot{r} \ (q \ r \ Q +2 (Q^2-r) \dot{t})}{r ((r-2) r+Q ^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot r = \frac{((r-2) \ r+Q^2) (q \ r \ Q  \ \dot{t}+r^4 \dot{\Omega}^2+(Q^2-r) \ \dot{t}^2)}{r^5}+\frac{(r-Q^2) \dot{r}^2}{r \ ((r-2) \ r+Q^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \Omega = -\frac{2 \ \dot{\Omega} \ \dot{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The total [[time dilation]] between the test-particle and an observer at infinity is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot t= \frac{q \  Q  \ r^3 + E \ r^4}{r^2 \ (r^2-2 r+Q^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The first derivatives &lt;math&gt;\dot x^i&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components of the local 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;v^i&lt;/math&gt; are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\dot x^i = \frac{v^i}{\sqrt{(1-v^2) \ |g_{i i}|}}.&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\dot r = \frac{v_\parallel \sqrt{r \ (r-2 M)-Q^2}}{r \sqrt{(1-v^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot \Omega = \frac{v_{\perp}}{r \sqrt{(1-v^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[specific orbital energy]]

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{\sqrt{Q^2+(r-2) r}}{r \sqrt{1-v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[specific relative angular momentum]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{v_\perp \ r}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

of the test-particle are conserved quantities of motion. &lt;math&gt;v_{\parallel}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; are the radial and transverse components of the local velocity-vector. The local velocity is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{v_\perp^2+v_\parallel^2} = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 r^2-Q^2-r^2+2 r}{E^2 r^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative formulation of metric==
The metric can alternatively be expressed like this:
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{G}{r^2}\left[2Mr - Q^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{x}{r} , \frac{y}{r}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the object, ''Q'' is the constant charge of the object, and ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]].

'''Reterritorialization''' ({{lang-fr|reterritorialisation}}) is the restructuring of a place or territory that has experienced [[deterritorialization]].  Deterritorialization is a term created by [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]] in their philosophical project ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980).  They distinguished that relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization.  It is the design of the new power. For example, when the [[Spain|Spanish]] ([[Hernán Cortés]]) conquered the [[Aztecs]], and after the Spanish deterritorialized by eliminating the [[symbols]] of the Aztecs' [[beliefs]] and [[ritual]]s, the Spanish then reterritorialized by putting up their own beliefs and rituals.  This form of [[propaganda]] established their takeover of the land.  Propaganda is an attempt to reterritorialize by influencing people's ideas through information distributed on a large scale.  For example, during [[World War I]], the U.S. put up posters everywhere to encourage young men to join the military and fight.

==Use in anthropology==
Reterritorialization is when people within a place start to produce an aspect of popular culture themselves, doing so in the context of their local culture and making it their own. An example would be the Indonesian Hip Hop. Although [[hip hop]] and [[Rap music|rap]] grew out of the [[inner city|inner cities]] of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] during the 1980s and 1990s, by the time it reached [[Indonesia]] through Europe and [[Central Asia]], it had already lost some of its original characteristics. Imported hip hop diffused first to a small group of people in Indonesia; then, Indonesians began to create hip hop music. Although the music was hip hop, the local artists integrated their local culture with the practises of the “foreign” hip hop to create a hybrid that was no longer foreign.

Most current work in [[human geography]] uses anthropological definitions of culture and often views the practice associated with popular culture as cultural expressions that may reveal or create aspects of place, space landscape, and identity.  The continuous cycles of deterritorialization and reterritorialization through axiomatization makes up one of the basic rhythms of capitalist society.  [[Karl Marx]] referred to this as the constant revolution of the means of production and uninterrupted disturbances of all social conditions that distinguish the [[bourgeois]] era from all the previous.  The fundamental mechanism of capital accompanies the process of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.  It conjoins deterritorialized resources and appropriates the surplus from their reterritorialized conjunction.

Deterritorialization and reterritorialization presuppose and reinforce the notice of a common essence of desire and labor.  This refers to the detachment and reattachment of the energies of production in general of investments of all kinds, whether conventionally considered psychological or economical.

==Mass media==
Since the introduction of the [[mass media]], reterritorialization has become more prevalent. The [[mass media]] have expedited the process of deterritorialization and reterritorialization and allowed it to occur at a global level. Communications technology has connected the entire world and, in a sense, created a global culture that encompasses everyone who has access to these communications technologies. Anyone who has the internet is part of this culturally diffused community.
Once a local culture is part of the global community the process of deterritorialization and reterritorialization continues as the global culture takes from and feeds to all the communities that take part in it. A pop culture example that comments on global reterritorialization is the song "[[Californication (song)|Californication]]" by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The song is about how [[California]]'s culture influences the world; a trend that is picked up in California will likely be picked up everywhere in the global community.  One of the final verses of the song mentions the destruction that takes place during deterritorialization, but how that opens up the opportunity for reterritorialization: “Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation, and earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration, and tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication.”  These lyrics capture the essence of reterritorialization at a global level.  California is, in a sense, a cultural node in the global community; a place where international trends begin.  Deterritorialization and reterritorialization are a continuous part of the evolution of the global culture, and the mass media is its catalyst.

'''Self-esteem''', in regards to [[communication]], is the evaluative element of the perception of oneself.  It is one’s perception of [[self-appraisal]], [[self-worth]], [[attractiveness]], and [[social competence]].

== Influences on self-esteem ==
There are three primary influences on self-esteem:  [[reflected appraisal]], [[social comparison]], and contingencies of self-worth.  Reflected appraisal refers to messages you receive from others that assess your self-concept.  For example, we are not able to believe that we are smart if the ones who are important in our lives tell us that we are slow or dumb.  Social comparison is evaluating ourselves by comparing our own abilities, attributes, and accomplishments to those of other people.  When we surround ourselves with others whom we perceive to be superior to us, our self-esteem tends to diminish, while when we surround ourselves with others whom we perceive to be not as talented as us, our self-esteem tends to inflate.  Lastly, contingencies of self-worth is how our  self-esteem is influenced by what is perceived as most important to us feeling good about ourselves.  For example, one person's self-esteem could be highly contingent on doing well in academics and having a lot of friends whereas another person's self-esteem could be highly contingent on their performance in athletics and adherence to moral standards.

== Protecting our self-esteem ==
Individuals protect their self-esteem by exercising a [[self-serving bias]], which is the tendency to attribute successful behavior to oneself but to assign external circumstances to one's unsuccessful behavior.  For example, a football wide-receiver will give himself all of the credit for a miraculous catch but will blame the quarterback for a dropped one.  The tendency to emphasize one's accomplishments and downplay one's failures is common.  People will be unlikely to learn new skills or gain knowledge unless they become mindful of this tendency.

== Optimal self-esteem ==
Optimal self-esteem comes from an individual achieving significant accomplishments without expecting a reward.  It is the unconscious effort to please others without expecting anything in return.  This is unlikely to occur when one places oneself at the mercy of other people's appraisals.  Optimal self-esteem develops, paradoxically, when one concentrates on accomplishing one's goals and dreams, rather than acting in order to build self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J.

The '''sociocultural perspective''' is a theory used in fields such as [[psychology]] and is used to describe [[awareness]] of circumstances surrounding individuals and how their [[Behavior|behaviors]] are affected specifically by their surrounding, social and cultural factors. According to Catherine A. Sanderson (2010) “Sociocultural perspective: A perspective describing people’s behavior and mental processes as shaped in part by their social and/or cultural contact, including race, gender, and nationality.” Sociocultural perspective theory is a broad yet significant aspect in our being. It applies to every sector of our daily lives. How we communicate, understand, relate and cope with one another is partially based on this theory. Our spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, physiological being are all influenced by factors studied by sociocultural perspective theory.

==Ideology==
Various studies examine topics using the sociocultural perspective in order to account for variability from person to person and acknowledge that social and cultural differences affect these individuals. One example comes from the journal ''[[European Psychologist]]'': Investigating Motivation in Context: Developing Sociocultural Perspectives by Richard A. Walker, Kimberley Pressick-kilborn, Bert M. Lancaster, and Erica J. Sainsbury (2004). Recently, however, a renewed interest in the contextual nature of motivation has come about for several reasons. First, the relatively recent influence of the ideas of Vygotsky and his followers (John-Steiner &amp; Mahn, 1996; Greeno &amp; The Middle School Through Applications Project, 1998) in [[educational psychology]] has led writers in the field (Goodenow, 1992; Pintrich, 1994; Anderman &amp; Anderman, 2000) to acknowledge the importance of context and to call for its greater recognition in educational psychology, and more particularly in motivational research. As both Goodenow (1992) and Hickey (1997) note, in sociocultural theories deriving from Vygotsky, human activities, events, and actions cannot be separated from the context in which they occur so that context becomes an important issue in sociocultural research. Second, researchers concerned with learning and cognition (e.g., Greeno et al., 1998) have come to see these processes also as being situated in particular contexts. While this view, with its emphasis on the distributed nature of learning and cognition, has origins in sociocultural theories".

This theory or perspective is examined in ''[[The Modern Language Journal]]'' “A Sociocultural Perspective on Language Learning Strategies: The Role of Mediation” by Richard Donato and Dawn McCormick. According to Donato and McCormick (1994) “Sociocultural theory maintains that social interaction and cultural institutions, such as schools, classrooms, etc., have important roles to play in an individual’s cognitive growth and development.” “We believe that this perspective goes beyond current cognitive and social psychological conceptions of strategic language learning, both of which assume that language tasks and contexts are generalizable. The sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, views language learning tasks and contexts as situated activities that are continually under development (22) and that are influential upon individuals’ strategic orientations to classroom learning.”&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Language Journal'', Vol 78(4), Win, 1994. Special issue: Sociocultural theory and second language learning. pp. 453-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health factors==
The sociocultural perspective is also used here in order to assess use of [[Mental health professional|mental health]] services for immigrants: “From a sociocultural perspective, this article reviews causes of mental health service under use among Chinese immigrants and discusses practice implications. Factors explaining service under use among Chinese immigrants are multifaceted, extending across individual, family, cultural and system domains. The first of these is cultural explanation of mental illness. Cultural beliefs, regarding the cause of mental disorders greatly affect service use. The perceived causes of mental illness include moral, religious, or cosmological, physiological, psychological, social and genetic factors”.  From Canadian Social Work, “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Social Work: “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, Autumn 2010, Vol. 12 Issue 1, p152-160, 9p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coping==
According to ''[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]'', "Coping with perceived racial and gender discrimination experiences among 11 Asian/Asian American female faculty at various Christian universities" have been examined in this theory. After the study was conducted the results revealed that "ten of the 11 women described experiences where they perceived being treated differently due to race and/or gender. Qualitative analyses of interview data revealed four themes related to coping: Proactive Coping, External Support, Personal Resources, and Spiritual Coping. The resulting themes are discussed in light of existing research, with an emphasis on the importance of understanding cultural and religious values to the study of coping". Kim, C. L., Hall, M., Anderson, T. L., &amp; Willingham, M. M. (2011). Coping with discrimination in academia: Asian-American and Christian perspectives. Asian American Journal of Psychology, 2(4), 291-305. doi:10.1037/a0025552

==Language==
Another instance of the sociocultural perspective can be found in [[language]] learning literature: “By adopting a sociocultural perspective that highlights the critical role of the social context in cognitive and social development (Vygotsky, 1978), we propose that learners’ actions to facilitate or sometimes constrain their language learning cannot be fully understood without considering the situated contexts in which strategies emerge and develop, as well as the kinds of hierarchies within which studies from diverse backgrounds find themselves in U.S. classrooms (Bourdieu, 1991). From Theory Into Practice, “A Sociocultural Perspective on Second Language Learner Strategies: Focus on the Impact of Social Context.” by Eun-Young Jang and Robert T. Jimenez, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Theory Into Practice. A Sociocultural Perspective on Second Language Learner Strategies: Focus on the Impact of Social Context. Eun-Young Jang and Robert T. Jimenez 2011, Vol. 50 Issue 2, p141-148. 8p.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">A '''sociocultural system''' is a "human [[population]] viewed (1) in its ecological context and (2) as one of the many [[subsystems]] of a larger [[ecological systems|ecological system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena (1984).

[[File:SCSdiagram.jpg|thumb|350px|Conceptual Model of a Sociocultural System.]] The term "sociocultural system" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and system. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species.  A culture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society, together with the material products of such behaviors. The words "society" and "culture" are fused together to form the word "sociocultural". A system is "a collection of parts which interact with each other to function as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Draper L. (1980). ''Systems One: An Introduction to Systems Thinking.'' Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems Inc. {{ISBN|978-99962-805-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sociocultural system is most likely to be found in the writings of anthropologists who specialize in [[ecological anthropology]].

In 1979, Marvin Harris outlined a universal structure of sociocultural systems. He mentioned [[infrastructure]] (production and population), structure (which is behavioural, like corporations, political organizations, hierarchies, castes), and a [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (which is mental, like beliefs, values, norms).&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W., 2013, "Harris on the Universal Structure of Society," Retrieved 2015-02-15, http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Essays/Harris1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120219 Sociocultural Systems:Principles of Structure and Change], Frank W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38813">'''System justification theory''' ('''SJT''') is a theory within [[social psychology]] that system-justifying beliefs serve a psychologically palliative function. It proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous to certain people. People have epistemic, existential, and relational needs that are met by and manifest as ideological support for the prevailing structure of social, economic, and political norms. Need for order and stability, and thus resistance to change or alternatives, for example, can be a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good, legitimate, and even desirable.

According to system justification theory, people desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and the groups to which they belong (group-justification), but also to hold positive attitudes about the overarching social structure in which they are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification). This system-justifying motive sometimes produces the phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, an acceptance of inferiority among low-status groups and a positive image of relatively higher status groups. Thus, the notion that individuals are simultaneously supporters and victims of the system-instilled norms is a central idea in system justification theory. Additionally, the passive ease of supporting the current structure, when compared to the potential price (material, social, psychological) of acting out against the status quo, leads to a shared environment in which the existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred. Alternatives to the status quo tend to be disparaged, and inequality tends to perpetuate.&lt;ref name="jostbanaji1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
Previous social psychological theories that aimed to explain intergroup behavior typically focused on the tendencies for people to have positive attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and their self-relevant groups (group-justification).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In other words, people are motivated to engage in behaviors that allow for them to maintain a high self-esteem and a positive image of their group.&lt;ref name=Jost&amp;Hunyady2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Orsolya Hunyady |title=The psychology of system justification and the palliative function of ideology|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=13|pages=111–153|doi=10.1080/10463280240000046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
System Justification theory addressed the additional, prevalent phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, in which people defend the social systems (status quo) even when it does not benefit, and in the long-run may even cause more harm, to the individual or the group to which he or she belongs. Out-group favoritism can manifest as a dis-identification on the part of members of lower social status with their own categorical grouping (social, ethnic, economic, political) and instead further support for the existing structure. Prior social psychology theories lacked explanation for and attention given to popular instances of out-group favoritism; thus, SJT was developed to further explain and understand why some people tend to legitimize the prevailing social systems, despite their being against one's interests, in a way that previous social psychological theories did not.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

==Theoretical influences==
While [[Social Identity Theory]], [[Cognitive Dissonance|Cognitive Dissonance Theory]], [[Just-world hypothesis|Just-World Hypothesis]], [[Social Dominance Theory]], and [[false consciousness|Marxist-Feminists Theories of Ideologies]] have heavily influenced System Justification Theory, it has also expanded on these perspectives, infusing them with the system-justification motive and behaviors.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
One of the most popular and well-known social psychological theories, [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] explains that people have a need to maintain cognitive consistency in order to retain a positive self-image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jostetal2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Brett W. Pelham |author3=Oliver Sheldon |author4=Bilian Sullivan |title=Social inequality and the reduction of ideological dissonance on behalf of the system: evidence of enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=33|issue=1|pages=13–36|doi=10.1002/ejsp.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; System justification theory builds off the cognitive dissonance framework, in that it posits people will justify a social system in order to retain a positive image of that social system, due to the fact that they inherently play a role (whether passive or active) in perpetuating it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Social identity theory===
Jost and colleagues interpret [[social identity theory]] as suggesting that when people are presented with intergroup conflict that threatens their social group identities people will justify behaviors like [[stereotypes|stereotyping]] and [[discrimination]] against outgroups in order to maintain their positive group image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This interpretation has been rejected by social identity theorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/014466601164777|title=Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=173–176|year=2001|last1=McGarty|first1=Craig|pmid=11446223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People with out-group favoritism will hold more positive images of other, often higher status, groups (outgroups) than the groups they belong to (ingroups). Thus, the argument is that system justification theory builds on the foundations of social identity theory in attempting to account for the out-group favoritism observed in many disadvantaged group members that social identity theory does not.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jost|first=John T.|chapter=Outgroup favoritism and the theory of system justification: A paradigm for investigating the effects of socioeconomic success on stereotype content|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|year=2001|pages=89–102 |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907081147/http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost%20(2001)%20Outgroup%20favoritism%20and%20the%20theory%20of%20system%20justification1.pdf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA89|editor-first=Gordon B. |editor-last=Moskowitz|isbn=9780805834147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social dominance theory===
This theory has widely been compared to system justification theory since they are both system justifying theories. [[Social dominance theory]] focuses on people’s motive to maintain a positive group image by generally supporting hierarchical inequality at the group level. Individuals with a high social dominance orientation (SDO) will hold myths that tend to be hierarchy enhancing, which justify an in-group's place and their relation to it. Thus, in both social dominance theory and system justification theory, there are common threads of group-based opposition to equality and justification for maintaining intergroup inequalities through systemic norms.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin&amp;Hewstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Rubin|author2=Miles Hewstone |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al.|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=823–844|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidaniusetal2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|author2=Felicia Pratto |author3=Colette Van Laar |author4=Shana Levin |title=Social Dominance Theory: Its Agenda and Method|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=845–880|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00401.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in a just world===
This [[Just-world theory|theory]] broadly explains that people are inclined to believe the world is generally fair, and that the outcomes of people’s behavior are subsequently deserved. Ideologies that relate to belief in a just world have to do with maintaining a sense of personal control and a desire to understand the world as non-random. Such ideologies include the protestant work ethic and belief in meritocracy. Essentially, belief in a just world feeds an epistemic need for predictability, order, and stability in one's environment. System justification theory, while keeping the perspective that people are inclined to believe the world is just, extracts the underlying epistemic needs of the just world ideology and uses them as support for why people are motivated to uphold the system. In other words, preference for stability, predictability, and the perception of personal control, over random chance, motivates one to see the status quo as fair and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This can be an issue, however, due to the fact that disadvantaged people can easily internalize their low position and blame themselves for 'shortcomings' or lack of 'successes.'

===False consciousness===
In order to account for the phenomenon of outgroup favoritism that is a main component of system justification, theorists have derived heavily from the Marxist-feminist theories on the prevailing ideologies as tools to preserve the system. In particular, the concept of [[false consciousness]], in which the dominant group in society believes their dominance to be destined, can help to inform why certain members of disadvantage groups sometimes engage in outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Further, system justification emphasizes that those that lack means of material production (lower status) are subject to the ideas, (cultural values, legislation, and social teachings) of the dominant, controlling group.

==Aspects of system justification theory==

===Rationalization of the status quo===

One of the main aspects of [[system justification theory]] explains that people are motivated to justify the [[status quo]] and view it as stable and desirable. To this extent, theorists have provided specific [[hypotheses|hypothesis]] in which the rationalization of the status quo can manifest. One consequence of the system-justifying motivation, is the rationalization of desirability of likely versus less-likely events.

Since people will be inclined to make sure their preferences are congruent with the status quo, in situations of inevitability, people are more likely to endorse the status quo as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant realities. In essence, people will judge events that are more likely as more desirable than events that are less likely.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Anticipatory rationalization studies completed during presidential election in 2000 demonstrate how future candidate endorsement and desirability is dependent on the likelihood of that candidate winning.  When subjects of both the Republican and Democratic parties were told, for example, that it was probable that one candidate would win over the other, people of both parties tended to rationalize support for the more likely winner. System justification for seemingly inevitable and unavoidable outcomes serves as a stress/dissonance reducer and provides psychological and emotional consolation, as well as allowing the individual to feel a sense of control over external events.

Another way people rationalize the [[status quo]] is through the use of [[stereotypes]]. When people perceive threats to the predominant system, they are more inclined to cling to and back the existing structure, and one way of doing so is by means of endorsing [[stereotypes]] that rationalize inequality. If one considers oneself a member of a higher social status group (economic standing, race, gender) he or she will hold favorable stereotypes about their group and less positive ones toward lower status outgroups. As perceived legitimacy of the system or threat to it increases, members of both disadvantaged and advantaged groups will be more motivated to utilize [[stereotypes]] as explanatory rationalizations (no matter how weak) for unequal status differences. Those that belong to disadvantaged groups will tend to associate positive characteristics (favorable stereotypes) to high status members and lead low status group members to minimize negative feelings about their low status.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Thus, stereotype endorsement as system justification is consensual and holds a palliative function. This is true for both the ingroup and outgroup. Stereotypes also deflect blame of unfair status differences from the system and instead, attribute inequality to group traits or characteristics. Such rationalization for inequality via stereotyping is said to be what makes political conservatives happier than liberals. In a recent research study on the connection of system justification beliefs and [[ambivalent sexism]], researchers found that benevolent sexism beliefs related to higher [[life satisfaction]] through system justification. That is, both men and women may be motivated to hold benevolent sexism beliefs because such beliefs may help to promote the notion that the status quo is fair, which in turn can maintain life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0361684312456369|title = Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing? Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume = 36|issue = 4|pages = 432–443|year = 2012|last1 = Connelly|first1 = K.|last2 = Heesacker|first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup favoritism===
In contrast to [[ingroup favoritism]], which holds that people have a motivation to regard the social groups that they belong in more positively than other groups, outgroup favoritism is when people tend to regard groups to which they do not belong more positively than the groups to which they are members.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists argue that this is an example or manifestation of how some people have unconsciously absorbed, processed, and attempted to cope with existing inequalities—more specifically, one's own disadvantaged position in the social hierarchy. Because people have a tendency to justify the status quo (which usually consists of inequality among groups) and believe that it is fair and legitimate, certain people from low status groups will accept, internalize, and hence perpetuate that inequality.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

Criticisms of outgroup favoritism have suggested observations of this in disadvantaged group members are simply manifestations of more general [[demand characteristics]] or [[social norms]] that encourage low status groups to evaluate other groups more positively.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In response to this, system justification theorists introduced both implicit and explicit measures of outgroup favoritism. It was found that low status group members still exhibited outgroup favoritism (i.e. preference for other groups) on both implicit and explicit measures, and they displayed higher instances of outgroup favoritism on implicit measures than on explicit (self-reported) measures. In contrast, people from high status groups were found to display [[ingroup favoritism]] more on implicit measures.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JostPelhamCarvallo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brett Pelham |author3=Mauricio Carvallo |title=Non-conscious forms of system justification: Implicit and behavioral preferences for higher status groups.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=38|issue=6|pages=586–602|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00505-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it is expected that when motivation to justify the system or status quo increases and it is perceived to be more legitimate, high status group members will also display increased [[ingroup favoritism]], while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;
Researchers have also linked [[conservatism|political conservatism]] with system justification, in that conservatism is associated with upholding [[tradition]] and resistance to change, which is similar to justifying the status quo (or current state of social, political, and economic [[norm (social)|norm]]s). Along this vein, system justification theorists hold that high status group members will engage in increased [[ingroup favoritism]] the more politically conservative they are, while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism the more politically [[conservative]] they are.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Depressed entitlement===
Research on [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|wage disparities]] among men and women have found that women often believe they are paid less than men because they do not deserve equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hough|first=Mary|author2=Janice D. Yoder |title=The Role of Status in Producing Depressed Entitlement in Women's and Men's Pay Allocations|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2003|volume=27|issue=4|pages=330–337|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Major|first=Brenda|author2=Mark Zanna |chapter=From social inequality to personal entitlement: The role of social comparisons, legitimacy appraisals, and group membership|year=1994|volume=26|pages=293–355|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-00371-006|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60156-2|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152261}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depressed entitlement was first thought as the manifestation of women internalizing the low status of their gender compared to men. Subsequent research has found depressed entitlement occur across contexts in which gender was not a variable. System justification theorists have suggested that depressed entitlement is another general example of how individuals of low status groups absorb their inferiority in order to justify the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; As such, system justification holds that low status group members regardless of context will be more likely to display instances of depressed entitlement than high status group members. And this will be seen more among low status group members for completed work as opposed to work not yet completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Hart|author2=Greg George |author3=Jennifer Crocker |title=Contexts of System Justification and System Evaluation: Exploring the Social Comparison Strategies of the (Not Yet) Contented Female Worker|journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=126–137|doi=10.1177/1368430201004002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego, group, and system justification motives===
As previously stated, people are motivated by the desire for [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] to view themselves and their group positively (which can manifest through feelings of [[self-esteem]] and value).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; The system-justification motive is people’s desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light as legitimate and fair. Among high status group members, all three of these motives are congruent with one another. The need to believe the system is just and fair is easy for high status group members because they are the groups benefiting from the system and status quo. Therefore, as the advantaged groups, holding positive regard for the self and group corresponds readily with believing the status quo is legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;

In particular, as system justification motives increase for high status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will decrease, levels of [[self-esteem]] will increase, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will decrease.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; For low status groups, the [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] motives come into conflict with the system-justification motive. If low status group members have a desire to believe the status quo and prevailing system is fair and legitimate, then this would conflict with the motivation of these individuals to maintain positive self and group images. Theorists posit that this conflict of justification motives creates conflicting or [[ambivalence|mixed attitudes]] in low status groups as a result of being the disadvantaged group that does not necessarily benefit from the status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Diana Burgess |title=Attitudinal Ambivalence and the Conflict between Group and System Justification Motives in Low Status Groups|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2000|volume=26|issue=3|pages=293–305|doi=10.1177/0146167200265003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As system justification motives increase for low status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will increase and occur at stronger levels compared to high status groups, levels of [[self-esteem]] will decrease, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will increase. Moreover, researchers suggest that when ego and group justification motives are particularly decreased, system-justification motives will increase.&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"/&gt;

===Enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged===
Based on [[cognitive dissonance theory]] that holds people have a need to reduce dissonance and maintain cognitive consistency, system justification theory explains that people are motivated to rationalize and justify instances of inequality in order to preserve and defend the legitimacy of the system.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Because people have this need to believe the current prevailing system is legitimate and the way it is for a reason, when presented with instances where this might threaten that, people will respond with more justifications to maintain the legitimacy of the system or status quo. Since high status group members regularly benefit from the prevailing system, they are expected to rarely be presented with examples that would threaten the legitimacy of the system. In contrast, it is expected that low status group members who do not benefit from the system, would be presented more regularly with threats to the legitimacy of the system and status quo. Thus, it is expected for system justification tendencies to increase in societies with more substantial group inequalities, and low status group members will be more inclined than high status group members to provide more intense justifications to rationalize and uphold the prevailing systems and status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Compensatory stereotypes===
Research has found that [[stereotypes|compensatory stereotypes]] might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, [[stereotypes]] that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.”&lt;ref name=KayJost2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Aaron|author2=John Jost |title=Complementary Justice: Effects of "Poor but Happy" and "Poor but Honest" Stereotype Exemplars on System Justification and Implicit Activation of the Justice Motive|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=5|pages=823–837|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.823|pmid=14599247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those with more left leaning [[political ideologies]], while those with more right leaning [[political ideologies]] preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized [[Social inequality|inequality]] rather than compensated for it.&lt;ref name="Kay Jost2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Left–right ideological differences in system justification following exposure to complementary versus noncomplementary stereotype exemplars|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|pages=290–298|doi=10.1002/ejsp.500|last1=Kay|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Czapliński|first2=Szymon|last3=Jost|first3=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But that overall, [[conservatives]] were more likely to have increased system justification tendencies than [[Liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brian A. Nosek |author3=Samuel D. Gosling |title=Ideology: Its Resurgence in Social, Personality, and Political Psychology|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=126–136|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00070.x|pmid=26158879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Jack Glaser |author3=Arie W.Kruglanski |author4=Frank Sulloway |title=Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=129|issue=3|pages=339–375|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339|pmid=12784934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of system justification==
Consequences of people’s motivation to legitimize the status quo are wide-ranging. In needing to believe that the current or prevailing systems are fair and just, results in people justifying the existing inequalities within it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Research on system justification theory has been applied to many different social and political contexts that have found the theory has implications for general [[social change]], social policies, and specific [[communities]].
Research has found that people with increased system justification motives are more resistant to change, and thus an implication of this would be greater difficulty to move towards [[policy|policies]], [[governments]], [[authority]] figures, and [[hierarchies]] that reflect [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Gary|author2=John Jost |title=System Justification Theory and Research: Implications for Law, Legal Advocacy, and Social Justice|journal=California Law Review|year=2006|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1119–1168|jstor=20439060|doi=10.2307/20439060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that system justification motives reduce emotional distress in people that would otherwise result in demands for amendments to perceived [[injustices]] or inequalities. Specifically, [[moral outrage]], guilt, and [[frustration]] are reduced when system justification motives increase. This has shown to result in less support for social policies that redistribute resources in the aim for [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Orsola Hunyady |title=ecedents and Consequences of System-Justifying Ideologies|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=14|issue=5|pages=260–265|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakslak|first=Cheryl|author2=John T.

In developing countries, in which group inequalities are most evident, researchers were interested in testing the claim of system justification theory that when inequalities are more visible, this will result in greater justification of the status quo.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=PJ|author2=Andrea Saul |title=The Development of System Justification in the Developing World|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3|pages=365–378|doi=10.1007/s11211-006-0012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers visited the most impoverished areas of [[Bolivia]], and found that among children (aged 10–15) who were members of low status groups, legitimized the [[Bolivian government]] as sufficiently meeting the needs of the people more than children from high status groups. Observing system-justification motives in low status groups located in one of the most impoverished countries implies there will be less support for [[social change]] in a country that arguable needs it the most.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"/&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, there were different reactions to the devastation it brought to communities as well as the government’s [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]]. Researchers who have studied these reactions, found that the slow and inefficient response of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]] were perceived by some to expose “governmental shortcomings, call into question the legitimacy of agency leadership, and highlight [[racial inequality]] in [[United States of America|America]].”&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Jaime L.|author2=Anesu N. Mandisodza |author3=Susan M. Andersen |author4=John T. Jost |title=System Justification in Responding to the Poor and Displaced in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|year=2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–73|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2006.00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions indirectly brought a threat to the legitimacy of the U.S. government (i.e. the system). As a result of this system threat, researchers found that people tended to restore legitimacy to the system through utilizing [[stereotypes]] and [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;  In particular, since the majority of the communities affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] were generally low-income and composed mostly of [[minorities]], some people used [[stereotypes]] to blame the victims for their misfortune and restore legitimacy to the [[government]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt; Researchers explained how this could have consequences for the victims and restoring their homes and communities back to normal. Increased system justification, and increased victim blaming could be detrimental in providing the victims the resources needed to work towards repairing the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt;

==Critiques==

===Social identity theory debate===
This debate arose from [[social identity]] theorists countering a critique to the theory by system justification theorists. The critique by system justification theorists refers to the evidence for the theoretical conception of system justification theory that derived from limitations to [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists have stated that Social Identity Theory does not account for outgroup favoritism, and that the limitations of the theory only lend it to measure [[ingroup favoritism]]. Advocates for [[social identity theory]] claim that this critique is more a result of lack of research done that has focused on outgroup favoritism rather than a limitation of the theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt; Moreover, social identity theorists also claim this is not sufficient evidence for the need of system justification and [[Social Dominance Theory|social dominance]] theories to help account for justification motives. As such, they have claimed that research that measures outgroup favoritism from a social identity perspective is simply needed to bolster the theory. While both theories continue to produce findings, the debate continues to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt;

===Relation to status quo bias===
Another critique is that SJT is too similar and indistinguishable to [[status quo bias]]. Given that both deal directly with upholding and legitimizing the status quo, this critique is not unfounded. But system justification theory differs from the [[status quo bias]] in that it is predominately [[motivational]] rather than [[cognitive]]. Generally, the status quo bias refers to a tendency to prefer the default or established option when making choices. In contrast, system justification posits that people need and want to see prevailing social systems as fair and just. The motivational component of system justification means that its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Current research==
Congruent with a broader trend toward [[neuroscience]], current research on system justification has tested to see how this manifests in the [[brain]].

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J.

'''True Will''' is a term found within the mystical system of [[Thelema]], a magical society founded in 1904 with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writing of ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Stephen (ed). ''The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley: Tunisia 1923'', p. 79, n. 8. Weiser, 1996. {{ISBN|0-87728-856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAO131&gt;IAO131. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hdbq111/JoTS/JoTS1-1.pdf&amp;date=2010-01-17+12:04:48 Thelema &amp; Buddhism] in ''Journal of Thelemic Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 1, Autumn 2007, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined either as a person's grand destiny in life or as a moment-to-moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. True Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Thelemites in touch with their True Will are said to have eliminated or bypassed their false desires, conflicts, and habits, and accessed their connection with the divine. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as a stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor "lust of result". Crowley's ideas on the subject partly originated with the teachings of [[Eliphas Levi]], whose magical books emphasize the magician finding their magical identity &amp;ndash; his or her 'true self', which Levi referred to as the "True Will".

== Thelema ==
Thelema roughly means "will" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The phrase ''True Will'' does not appear in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central sacred text of Thelema. Nevertheless, [[Aleister Crowley]]'s various commentaries on the Book routinely postulate that each individual has a unique and incommensurable True Will that determines his or her proper course in life. Crowley's invention appears to be an attempt to explain how some actions may be wrong (or "false") when "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt".&lt;ref&gt;Liber AL III:60&lt;/ref&gt; Actions that conform to True Will are thus considered to be correct, while willed actions that deviate from True Will may nevertheless be wrong. In ''The Book of the Law'' Crowley wrote "Do What Thou Wilt". 

"DO WHAT THOU WILT" can often be misunderstood to mean "do what you want". When one says "do what thou wilt", this means that the origin of will directs the path. To understand and act upon one's True Will is a sort of "enlightenment" to Thelemites. The ultimate goal of a [[Thelema|Thelemite]] would be to understand and perform their True Will. True Will directs the individual towards destiny and forces them into the joy of accomplishing what they were meant to accomplish without "lust of result" (outside motivations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber AL vel Legis|year=1904|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
In Crowley's essay ''The Secret Conference'' (written under the pseudonym "Gerald Aumont", and prefaced to ''The Heart of the Master''), he suggests that a technique must be devised by which a child's True Will may be discovered at birth, or as early as possible in life, in order to permit the correct ordering of society. 

In Crowley's ethical treatise [http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_duty.html ''Duty''], he identifies True Will with the Nature of the individual. This capitalized "Nature" may be compared with the "Perfect Nature" of earlier Gnostic systems, which was another term for the personal daimon or augoeides,{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} usually referenced by Crowley as the [[Holy Guardian Angel]]. 

''The Message of the Master Therion'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_message.html Liber II]) is a document that attempts to delineate the doctrine of True Will. By reference to [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib913.html ''Liber Thisharb''], Liber II suggests a theory of metempsychosis, whereby the individual True Will is the resultant of a person's prior incarnations. But here as elsewhere, Crowley stops short of asserting objective validity for memories of past lives. He recommends developing "the magical memory" as a means to an end, and connecting the aspirant's abilities and remembered past with some purpose. By definition, the aspirant's True Will must fit the aspirant's nature.

In ''De Lege Libellum'' ([http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_lege.html Liber CL]), Crowley defines True Will as the will which "does not rest content with things partial and transitory, but...proceed[s] firmly to the End", and in the same passage he identifies that "end" as the destruction of oneself in love.

In [[computer programming]], a '''variable''' or '''scalar''' is a storage location (identified by a [[Memory address|memory address]]) paired with an associated [[symbol|symbolic name]] (an ''[[Identifier (computer programming)|identifier]]''), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a ''[[value (computer science)|value]]''. The variable name is the usual way to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer [[source code]] can be [[Name binding|bound]] to a [[Value (computer science)|value]] during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of [[Execution (computing)|program execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=[[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] | pages=26-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald |date=1997 |title=The Art of Computer Programming |volume=1 |edition=3rd |location=Reading, Massachusetts |publisher=Addison-Wesley |page=3-4 |isbn=0-201-89683-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables in mathematics]]. The latter is [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]], having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an [[equation]] or [[formula]] as in mathematics. Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.

A variable's storage location may be referred by several different identifiers, a situation known as [[Aliasing_(computing)|aliasing]]. Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.

[[compiler (computing)|Compilers]] have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program execution.

==Actions on a variable==
In [[imperative programming|imperative]] [[programming language]]s, values can generally be [[Dereference|accessed]] or [[Assignment (computer science)|changed]] at any time. In [[Pure function|pure]] [[functional programming|functional]] and [[logic programming|logic language]]s, variables are [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] to expressions and keep a single value during their entire [[Scope (programming)|lifetime]] due to the requirements of [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. In imperative languages, the same behavior is exhibited by (named) [[constant (programming)|constant]]s (symbolic constants), which are typically contrasted with (normal) variables.

Depending on the [[type system]] of a programming language, variables may only be able to store a specified [[datatype]] (e.g. [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] or [[string (computer science)|string]]). Alternatively, a datatype may be associated only with the current value, allowing a single variable to store anything supported by the programming language.

Variables and scope:-
(A)	Automatic variables: - Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. Such variables are known as automatic variables. 
(B)	External variables: - These are variables that are external to a function on and can be accessed by name by any function. These variables remain in existence permanently; rather that appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.

==Identifiers referencing a variable==

An identifier referencing a variable can be used to access the variable in order to read out the value, or alter the value, or edit other [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of the variable, such as access permission, [[Lock (computer science)|locks]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], etc.

For instance, a variable might be referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;totalcows&lt;/code&gt;" and the variable can contain the number 1956.  If the same variable is referenced by the identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" as well, and if using this identifier "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;", the value of the variable is altered to 2009, then reading the value using the identifier "&lt;code&gt;total_count&lt;/code&gt;" will yield a result of 2009 and not 1956.

If a variable is only referenced by a single identifier that can simply be called ''the name of the variable''. Otherwise, we can speak of ''one of the names of the variable''.  For instance, in the previous example, the "&lt;code&gt;total cows&lt;/code&gt;" is a name of the variable in question, and "&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;" is another name of the same variable.

== {{Anchor|Scope and extent|SCOPE-AND-EXTENT}}Scope and extent ==
{{See also|Free variables and bound variables}}

The ''[[scope (programming)|scope]]'' of a variable describes where in a program's text the variable may be used, while the ''extent'' (or ''lifetime'') describes when in a program's execution a variable has a (meaningful) value. The scope of a variable is actually a property of the name of the variable, and the extent is a property of the variable itself. These should not be confused with ''context'' (also called ''environment''), which is a property of the program, and varies by point in the source code or execution – see [[Scope (computer science)#Overview|scope: overview]]. Further, [[object lifetime]] may coincide with variable lifetime, but in many cases is not tied to variable lifetime.

A variable name's ''scope'' affects its ''extent''.

''Scope'' is an important part of the [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] of a variable. Most languages define a specific ''scope'' for each variable (as well as any other named entity), which may differ within a given program. The scope of a variable is the portion of the program code for which the variable's name has meaning and for which the variable is said to be "visible". Entrance into that scope typically begins a variable's lifetime (as it comes into context) and exit from that scope typically ends its lifetime (as it goes out of context). For instance, a variable with "[[lexical scope]]" is meaningful only within a certain function/[[subroutine]], or more finely within a block of expressions/statements (accordingly with [[function scope]] or [[block scope]]); this is static resolution, performable at parse-time or compile-time. Alternatively, a variable with [[dynamic scope]] is resolved at run-time, based on a global binding stack that depends on the specific control flow. Variables only accessible within a certain functions are termed "[[local variable]]s". A "[[global variable]]", or one with indefinite scope, may be referred to anywhere in the program.

''Extent'', on the other hand, is a runtime ([[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic]]) aspect of a variable. Each [[name binding|binding]] of a variable to a value can have its own ''extent'' at runtime. The extent of the binding is the portion of the program's execution time during which the variable continues to refer to the same value or memory location. A running program may enter and leave a given extent many times, as in the case of a [[closure (computer science)|closure]].

Unless the programming language features [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], a variable whose extent permanently outlasts its scope can result in a [[memory leak]], whereby the memory allocated for the variable can never be freed since the variable which would be used to reference it for deallocation purposes is no longer accessible. However, it can be permissible for a variable binding to extend beyond its scope, as occurs in Lisp [[closure (computer science)|closures]] and C [[static local variable]]s; when execution passes back into the variable's scope, the variable may once again be used. A variable whose scope begins before its extent does is said to be ''[[uninitialized variable|uninitialized]]'' and often has an undefined, arbitrary value if accessed (see [[wild pointer]]), since it has yet to be explicitly given a particular value. A variable whose extent ends before its scope may become a [[dangling pointer]] and deemed uninitialized once more since its value has been destroyed. Variables described by the previous two cases may be said to be ''out of extent'' or ''unbound''. In many languages, it is an error to try to use the value of a variable when it is out of extent. In other languages, doing so may yield [[undefined behavior|unpredictable results]]. Such a variable may, however, be assigned a new value, which gives it a new extent.

For space efficiency, a memory space needed for a variable may be allocated only when the variable is first used and freed when it is no longer needed. A variable is only needed when it is in scope, thus beginning each variable's lifetime when it enters scope may give space to unused variables. To avoid wasting such space, compilers often warn programmers if a variable is declared but not used.

It is considered good programming practice to make the scope of variables as narrow as feasible so that different parts of a program do not accidentally interact with each other by modifying each other's variables. Doing so also prevents [[action at distance (computer science)|action at a distance]].  Common techniques for doing so are to have different sections of a program use different [[namespace (programming)|name space]]s, or to make individual variables "private" through either [[Dynamic variable scoping#Dynamic scoping|dynamic variable scoping]] or [[Lexical variable scoping#Static scoping|lexical variable scoping]].

Many programming languages employ a reserved value (often named ''[[null pointer|null]]'' or ''nil'') to indicate an invalid or uninitialized variable.

In [[static typing|statically typed]] languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[ML programming language|ML]], a variable also has a ''type'', meaning that only certain kinds of values can be stored in it. For example, a variable of type "[[integer (computer science)|integer]]" is prohibited from storing text values.

In [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]] languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], it is values, not variables, which carry type. In [[Common Lisp]], both situations exist simultaneously: A variable is given a type (if undeclared, it is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, the universal [[Subtype|supertype]]) which exists at compile time. Values also have types, which can be checked and queried at runtime.

Typing of variables also allows [[type polymorphism|polymorphisms]] to be resolved at compile time. However, this is different from the polymorphism used in object-oriented function calls (referred to as ''[[virtual functions]]'' in [[C++]]) which resolves the call based on the value type as opposed to the supertypes the variable is allowed to have.

Variables often store simple data, like integers and literal strings, but some programming languages allow a variable to store values of other [[datatype]]s as well. Such languages may also enable functions to be [[Parametric polymorphism#Parametric polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]]. These functions operate like variables to represent data of multiple types. For example, a function named &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; may determine the length of a list. Such a &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; function may be parametric polymorphic by including a type variable in its [[type signature]], since the amount of elements in the list is independent of the elements' types.

==Parameters==
The ''formal parameters'' (or ''formal arguments'') of functions are also referred to as variables. For instance, in this [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code segment,

&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def addtwo(x):
...     return x + 2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; addtwo(5)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

the variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a ''[[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]'' because it is given a value when the function is called.  The integer 5 is the ''argument'' which gives &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; its value. In most languages, function parameters have local scope. This specific variable named &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can only be referred to within the &lt;code&gt;addtwo&lt;/code&gt; function (though of course other functions can also have variables called &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;).

==Memory allocation==
The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of their values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language. Many language implementations allocate space for ''[[local variable]]s'', whose extent lasts for a single function call on the ''[[call stack]]'', and whose memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns. More generally, in ''[[name binding]]'', the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block. [[reference (computer science)|Referencing]] is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled. Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the ''[[Dynamic memory allocation#Heap-based memory allocation|heap]]''.

Bound variables have values. A value, however, is an abstraction, an idea; in implementation, a value is represented by some ''[[Object (computer science)|data object]]'', which is stored somewhere in computer memory. The program, or the [[runtime environment]], must set aside memory for each data object and, since memory is finite, ensure that this memory is yielded for reuse when the object is no longer needed to represent some variable's value.

Objects allocated from the heap must be reclaimed&amp;mdash;especially when the objects are no longer needed. In a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] language (such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Python, Golang and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]), the runtime environment automatically reclaims objects when extant variables can no longer refer to them. In non-garbage-collected languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], the program (and the programmer) must explicitly [[malloc|allocate]] memory, and then later free it, to reclaim its memory. Failure to do so leads to [[memory leak]]s, in which the heap is depleted as the program runs, risks eventual failure from exhausting available memory.

When a variable refers to a [[data structure]] created dynamically, some of its components may be only indirectly accessed through the variable. In such circumstances, garbage collectors (or analogous program features in languages that lack garbage collectors) must deal with a case where only a portion of the memory reachable from the variable needs to be reclaimed.

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|Naming conventions (programming)}}
{{See also|Identifier|Namespace}}

Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. &lt;code&gt;COST&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;. Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; for [[array index]] variables.

Some naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax which involves the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0–9) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether or not punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the [[underscore]] ("_") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]]s (symbols or punctuation) are affixed to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's datatype or scope.

[[Case-sensitivity]] of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] requires that names of types start with a capital letter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores ("__") often fall under this category.

However, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the [[machine code]] level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged.&lt;ref name="Choosing good variable names"&gt;[http://www.dotcadot.ca/articles/how-not-pick-variables How Not To Pick Variables], Retrieved July 11, 2012 [DEAD LINK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWD1044"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Edsger Dijkstra]] | title = To hell with “meaningful identifiers”! | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1044.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand. However, extreme verbosity in variable names can also lead to less comprehensible code.

==Variable types(based on lifetime)==
In terms of the classifications of variables, we can classify variables based on the lifetime of them. The different types of variables are static, stack-dynamic, explicit heap-dynamic, and implicit heap-dynamic. A static variable is also known as global variable, it is bound to a memory cell before execution begins and remains to the same memory cell until termination. A typical example is the static variables in C and C++. A Stack-dynamic variable is known as local variable, which is bound when the declaration statement is executed, and it is deallocated when the procedure returns. The main examples are local variables in C subprograms and Java methods. Explicit Heap-Dynamic variables are nameless (abstract) memory cells that are allocated and deallocated by explicit run-time instructions specified by the programmer. The main examples are dynamic objects in C++ (via new and delete) and all objects in Java. Implicit Heap-Dynamic variables are bound to heap storage only when they are assigned values. Allocation and release occur when values are reassigned to variables. As a result, Implicit heap-dynamic variables have the highest degree of flexibility. The main examples are some variables in JavaScript, PHP and all variables in APL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34867">[[Image:Euclidean Voronoi diagram.svg|thumb|20 points and their Voronoi cells (larger version [[#Illustration|below]])]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''Voronoi diagram''' is a [[Partition of a set|partitioning]] of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to its [[Delaunay triangulation]].

It is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], and is also called a '''Voronoi tessellation''', a '''Voronoi decomposition''', a '''Voronoi partition''', or a '''Dirichlet tessellation''' (after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]). Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in a large number of fields, mainly in [[science]] and [[technology]], but also in [[visual art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Franz |last=Aurenhammer |authorlink=Franz Aurenhammer |date=1991 |title=Voronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=345–405 |doi=10.1145/116873.116880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Atsuyuki |last1=Okabe |first2=Barry |last2=Boots |first3=Kokichi |last3=Sugihara |first4=Sung Nok |last4=Chiu |date=2000 |title=Spatial Tessellations – Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=0-471-98635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=kvoJCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Thiessen%20polygon&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=Thiessen%20voronoi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=-FbVI-2tSuYC&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=Thiessen%20polygon&amp;pg=PA333#v=onepage&amp;q=Thiessen%20voronoi&amp;f=false Geographic Information Systems and Science, By Paul Longley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=6N0yDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Thiessen%20voronoi&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=Thiessen%201912&amp;f=false Spatial Modeling Principles in Earth Sciences, Zekai Sen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The simplest case==
In the simplest case, shown in the first picture, we are given a finite set of points {''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} in the [[Euclidean plane]]. In this case each site ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle X &lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] with distance function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt; be a set of indices and let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (P_k)_{k \in K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt;, associated with the site &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; whose distance to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to the other sites &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is any index different from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d(x,\, A) \;=\; \inf\{d(x,\, a) \mid a \,\in\, A\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance between the point &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; and the subset &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; R_k = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_k) \leq d(x, P_j)\; \text{for all}\; j \neq k\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (R_k)_{k \in K} &lt;/math&gt;. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.

In the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, 2-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, in general the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.

In the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt; is associated with a generator point  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_1&lt;/math&gt; be a point that generates its Voronoi region  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_2&lt;/math&gt; that generates  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_3&lt;/math&gt; that generates  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_3&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. &lt;!--Then,

:&lt;math&gt; R_1 = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_1) \leq d(x, P_2) \;\and\; d(x, P_1) \leq d(x, P_3) \;\and\; \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_2 = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_2) \leq d(x, P_1) \;\and\; d(x, P_2) \leq d(x, P_3) \;\and\; \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
:...
--&gt; Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''&lt;ref name="Tran09"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Q. T. |last1=Tran |first2=D. |last2=Tainar |first3=M. |last3=Safar |date=2009 |title=Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems |page=357 |isbn=9783642037214}}&lt;/ref&gt; "all locations in the Voronoi polygon are closer to the generator point of that polygon than any other generator point in the Voronoi diagram in Euclidean plane".

==Illustration==
As a simple illustration, consider a group of shops in a city. Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt; of a given shop &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).

For most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar
[[Euclidean distance]]: &lt;math&gt;\ell_2 = d\left[\left(a_1, a_2\right), \left(b_1, b_2\right)\right] = \sqrt{\left(a_1 - b_1\right)^2 + \left(a_2 - b_2\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt; or the [[Manhattan distance]]:&lt;math&gt;d\left[\left(a_1, a_2\right), \left(b_1, b_2\right)\right] = \left|a_1 - b_1\right| + \left|a_2 - b_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.

==Properties==
* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.
* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.
* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points are given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.
* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.&lt;ref name=Reem_alg&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Reem |title=An algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams of general generators in general normed spaces |doi=10.1109/ISVD.2009.23 |journal=Proceedings of the sixth International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams in science and engineering (ISVD 2009) |date=2009 |pages=144–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.
* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.&lt;ref name=Reem_geo_stable&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Reem |title=The geometric stability of  Voronoi diagrams with respect to small changes of the sites |arxiv=1103.4125 |date=2011 |doi=10.1145/1998196.1998234 |journal=Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG) |pages=254–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.

==History and research==
Informal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.
British physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.

Voronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Fedosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner–Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.
Other equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).

==Examples==
[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]

Voronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.
* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.
* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].
* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].
* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].
* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].
* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].
* Certain body centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].

For the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.

==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==
Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors.  Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.

Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order Voronoi diagram from set&amp;nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''X''.

===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===
For a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

For a given set of points ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if d(''q'', ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; d(''q'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) for each ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S'' with ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q''.&lt;ref name="berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

The boundaries of the cells in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram have the structure of a [[Real tree|topological tree]], with infinite [[Ray (mathematics)|rays]] as its leaves. Every finite tree is isomorphic to the tree formed in this way from a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==Generalizations and variations==
As implied by the definition, Voronoi cells can be defined for metrics other than Euclidean, such as the [[Mahalanobis distance]] or [[Manhattan distance]]. However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the 2-dimensional case.

[[Image:Approximate Voronoi Diagram.svg|thumb|Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]]
A [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], in this case some of the Voronoi cells  may be empty. A [[power diagram]] is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the [[Power of a point|power distance]]; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the [[quadrance|squared distance]] from the circle's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|contribution=13.6 Power Diagrams|pages=327–328|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=EATCS Monographs on Theoretical Computer Science|title=Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry|volume=10|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voronoi diagram of ''n'' points in ''d''-dimensional space requires &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O\left(n^{\left\lceil \frac{1}{2}d \right\rceil}\right)&lt;/math&gt; storage space.{{clarify | reason = 'Storage space' for what, exactly?|date=November 2016}} Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.{{clarify | reason = It seems implausible that a modern computer could not easily work with, say, a 3D diagram for reasonable ''n''|date=November 2016}} An alternative is to use [[approximate Voronoi diagram]]s, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;S. Arya, T. Malamatos, and [[David Mount|D. M. Mount]],

Voronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the [[medial axis]] (which has found applications in image segmentation, [[optical character recognition]], and other computational applications), [[straight skeleton]], and [[zone diagram]]s. Besides points, such diagrams use lines and polygons as seeds. By augmenting the diagram with line segments that connect to nearest points on the seeds, a planar subdivision of the environment is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Geraerts|first=Roland|pages=1997–2004|publisher=IEEE|series=International Conference on Robotics and Automation|title=Planning Short Paths with Clearance using Explicit Corridors|year=2010|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gerae101/pdf/ecm.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure can be used as a [[navigation mesh]] for path-finding through large spaces. The navigation mesh has been generalized to support 3D multi-layered environments, such as an airport or a multi-storey building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=van Toll|first1=Wouter G.|last2=Cook IV|first2=Atlas F.|last3=Geraerts|first3=Roland|pages=3526–3532|publisher=IEEE/RSJ|series=International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems|title=Navigation Meshes for Realistic Multi-Layered Environments|year=2011|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gerae101/pdf/navmesh.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[epidemiology]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to correlate sources of infections in epidemics. One of the early applications of Voronoi diagrams was implemented by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] to study the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in Soho, England. He showed the correlation between residential areas on the map of Central London whose residents had been using a specific water pump, and the areas with most deaths due to the outbreak.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic — and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8R3NrzE8veEC&amp;pg=PT187|date=19 October 2006|accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-15853-1|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
*In [[polymer physics]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to represent free volumes of polymers.
*In [[materials science]], polycrystalline microstructures in metallic alloys are commonly represented using Voronoi tessellations. In solid state physics, the [[Wigner-Seitz cell]] is the Voronoi tessellation of a solid, and the [[Brillouin zone]] is the Voronoi tessellation of reciprocal (wave number) space of crystals which have the symmetry of a space group.
*In [[aviation]], Voronoi diagrams are superimposed on oceanic plotting charts to identify the nearest airfield for in-flight diversion (see [[ETOPS]]), as an aircraft progresses through its flight plan.

*In [[mining]], Voronoi polygons are used to estimate the reserves of valuable materials, minerals, or other resources. Exploratory drillholes are used as the set of points in the Voronoi polygons.

=== Geometry ===
*A [[point location]] data structure can be built on top of the Voronoi diagram in order to answer [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] queries, where one wants to find the object that is closest to a given query point. Nearest neighbor queries have numerous applications. For example, one might want to find the nearest hospital, or the most similar object in a [[database]]. A large application is [[vector quantization]], commonly used in [[data compression]]. 
*In [[geometry]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to find the [[Largest empty sphere|largest empty circle]] amid a set of points, and in an enclosing polygon; e.g. to build a new supermarket as far as possible from all the existing ones, lying in a certain city.
*Voronoi diagrams together with farthest-point Voronoi diagrams are used for efficient algorithms to compute the [[Roundness (object)|roundness]] of a set of points.&lt;ref name="berg2008" /&gt; The Voronoi approach is also put to good use in the evaluation of circularity/[[roundness (object)|roundness]] while assessing the dataset from a [[coordinate-measuring machine]].
*Modern [[computational geometry]] has provided efficient algorithms for constructing Voronoi diagrams, and has allowed them to be used in [[mesh generation]], [[point location]], [[cluster analysis]], machining plans and many other computational tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=987|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[Computer network|networking]], Voronoi diagrams can be used in derivations of the capacity of a [[wireless network]].
*In [[computer graphics]], Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate 3D shattering / fracturing geometry patterns.  It is also used to procedurally generate organic or lava-looking textures.
* In autonomous [[robot navigation]], Voronoi diagrams are used to find clear routes. If the points are obstacles, then the edges of the graph will be the routes furthest from obstacles (and theoretically any collisions).
*In [[machine learning]], Voronoi diagrams are used to do [[k-nearest neighbor algorithm|1-NN]] classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Machine Learning |first=Tom M. |last=Mitchell |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=International |isbn=0-07-042807-7|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civics and planning ===
* In Victoria, Australia, government schools typically admit eligible students to the nearest primary school or high school to where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/parents/primary/Pages/boundary.aspx|title=Restrictions and boundaries|website=www.education.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students and parents can see which school "catchment zone" they live in by using [http://melbourneschoolzones.com/ this Voronoi representation].

===Song dynasty===
During the Song dynasty, [[Confucianism]] became the dominant belief system, and neo-Confucians such as [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]] placed strong emphasis on chastity, with Cheng Yi believed to be responsible for the rise of the cult of widow chastity.&lt;ref name="hsiang"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=132–133 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cheng Yi thought it improper for a man to marry a widow because "a marriage is a match and if one takes someone who has already lost her integrity, he would also lose his". On the question of widows who had become impoverished due to the death of their husbands, Cheng stated: "To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter."&lt;ref name="hsiang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey"/&gt;  While it was normal for widows to remarry in the early Song period, remarriage would become a social stigma in later eras due to the influence of Confucians, which led to hardship and loneliness for many widows.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

During the [[Ming dynasty]], chaste widows were elevated to the role of cultural heroes.&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;   Chaste widows were commemorated by the construction of chastity memorial [[Paifang|arches]] (貞節坊) and shrines, and honoured with commemorative writings.&lt;ref name="ropp"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029400200060 |title=Women in late imperial China: a review of recent english-language scholarship |journal=Women's History Review|volume= 3|issue=3|pages=347-383 |first=Paul S. |last=Ropp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Chaste and the Licentious: Female Sexuality and Moral Discourse in Ming and Early Qing China |first=Weijing |last=Lu|journal=Early Modern Women|volume= 5 |date=2010|pages =183-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state awarded 'testimonial of merit' (旌表, ''jingbiao'') to chaste women, giving approval of local chastity cults whereby commemorative arches and shrines were erected to honour the women by members of their families or communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=svYcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Women and Gender in Twentieth-Century China |first= Paul J. |last=Bailey |page=18 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow chastity became increasingly common, and chastity also became associated with suicide, with suicide by widows increasing dramatically during the Ming era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLCgu3XgOjMC&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| last=T'ien|first= Ju-k'ang |date=1988|title= Male Anxiety and Female Chastity: a comparative study of Chinese ethical values in Ming-Ch'ing time |publisher= Brill |isbn=978-9004083615|pages=xii, 39&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ropp"/&gt;

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:貞節牌坊（冰清玉潔） - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A chastity memorial arch]]
During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]], the prevalence of child marriage along with a high rate of premature death among men left a substantial number of young women as widowers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rowe, William T. Chinas last empire: the great Qing. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a widowed woman would have been taken into her husband's familial household before his death and as a result would be unable to fulfill her intended purpose; birthing a male child to continue the husband's patriline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, due to Qing-era China's higher proportion of men (mostly due to [[Female infanticide in China|female infanticide]]) a fertile woman, despite her previous marriage, could be sold and wed to another family for a substantial price.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The Qing court disapproved of this practice and instead regarded widow chastity as the epitome of [[filial piety]] and also as a statement of loyalty to the imperial court and the government officials.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passionate_Women.html?id=OStF1E7pUf8C|title=Passionate Women: Female Suicide in Late Imperial China|last=Ropp|first=Paul Stanley|last2=Zamperini|first2=Paola|last3=Zurndorfer|first3=Harriet Thelma|date=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004120181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote this viewpoint the Qing court arranged to confer honors upon a family housing a chaste widow along with other measures such as the construction of a large and ornate ceremonial arch—"Chastity [[Paifang]]" or "Chastity and Filial Paifang" (節孝牌坊) —in the family's community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Widows were also encouraged to adhere to chastity by way of legal impetuses, as according to Qing era law a widow could only inherit or act as a custodian of her husbands property if she preserved her sexuality as a statement of "loyalty" to her late husband.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In culturally dissident regions of the Chinese empire,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; government officials started "Widow Chastity" crusades to enforce orthodox Chinese culture and eliminate unconventional marriage customs, particularly the [[Levirate marriage|Levirate]], a practice in which a man marries his dead brother's widow in order to continue his patriline. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Decline  ==
The "widow chastity" agenda began to receive controversy from the Qing court when elite families in central regions of China started using the imperial commendation of widow chastity to gain an edge in the social competition within their communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Authorities were particularly concerned with dubious cases in which honors had been given to families where the widow had committed suicide following her husband's death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Despite suicide being regarded as an honorable and virtuous course of action for a widow to take,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the circumstances surrounding these suicides were  often very suspicious and suggested foul play on the part of the husband's family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eventually this issue led the imperial court to promote "Widow Chastity" with much less zeal and offer honors with more careful discretion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;New cultural and intellectual developments in Qing China, in particular, the "Evidential Research Movement" ([[Kaozheng]]), also began to open up new conversations on the fundamental morality of "Widow Chastity".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Skeptics of neo-Confucian status quo of the time, notably [[Wang Zhong (Qing dynasty)|Wang Zhong]], condemned "Widow Chastity" as a collection of outdated rituals lacking in logic and basic human compassion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
