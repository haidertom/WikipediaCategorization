'''Ahaṃkāra''' (अहंकार) is a [[Sanskrit]] term that is related to the ego and [[egotism|egoism]] - that is, the identification or attachment of one's ego. The term "ahamkara" comes from an approximately 3,000-year-old [[Vedic philosophy]], where Ahaṃ is the Self or "I" and kāra is "any created thing" or "to do". The term originated in [[Vedic philosophy]] over 3,000 years ago, and was later incorporated into [[Hindu philosophy]], particularly [[Saṃkhyā]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9985/ahankara "Ahamkara"], Britannica Academic Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahamkara is one of the four parts of the [[antahkarana]] (inner organ) described in [[Hindu philosophy]]. The other three parts are [[Buddhi]], [[Citta]] and [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]. In the [[Uttara Mimamsa]] or [[vedanta]] branch of [[Hindu philosophy]], even though it is not discussed in great detail in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]] says to Arjun that ahamkara must be removed - in other words, it should be subordinated to the lord. The reason for this is that the Self is not (cannot be) present when one is in a state of ahamkara.

In Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna says “ Air, water, earth, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and ahankaar (ego) together constitute the nature created by me.”

== Philosophical implications ==
To have an understanding of this term is to have a powerful tool for understanding the nature and behaviour of ourselves and of others. Vedic philosophy teaches that when one's mind is in a state of ahamkara, one is in a state of subjective illusion, where the mind has bound the concept of one's self with an external thing. That thing can be a tangible, material object, or it can be a concept (such as the concept of the fight for peace). The ego is involved in constructing the illusion.

'''Examples of ahaṃkāra in action:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Consider how an otherwise sensible young man might feel that his new sports car was a reflection of his true self and this would encourage him to race his car recklessly against another person's car.
* Similarly, consider how someone who believed in the fight for peace, and who ordinarily might behave in a non-violent manner, might come to blows with someone who threatened or challenged his notions of peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In both cases, the mind has created a state of illusion, but it seems very real to the person in that state, and subjectivity and reality are obscured. This deeply illusory state is what can often cause people to do the strangest, oddest things, sometimes evil, and often quite out of character. All humans can - and usually do at some time in their lives - suffer from this.

== Ahaṃkāra and spiritual development ==
{{unsourced-section|date=June 2017}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Ahaṃkāra is the instrument of [[Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)|Ahaṃ (the Spirit)]], the principle of individuation, acting as an independent conscious entity within the impure reality - yet, it does not have consciousness of its own. 
* Ahamkara is (actually soul/ego-soul) the instrument of the spirit (made by thought-material='dark energy' &amp; emotion-material='dark material') for individual development of the ego-soul, like DEHA (material-body/mold) is the instrument for individual development of the ego-soul/mind.
* It is a receptacle of Cit śakti, its consciousness being a small spark from Cit, the universal consciousness.
* manifests itself by assuming authorship of all the actions of buddhi, manas, the senses and organs of action.
* It is believed to exist in the sphere of duality, in a state of identification with the physical body, its needs and desires.
* It is related to ''Vak tattva'', one of [[The 36 tattvas]] in Vedic and Hindu religious philosophy.
* In ahaṃkāra, a state of ''rajas guna'' (agitation) predominates. This is because it identifies only with a small part of the creation (the body) and rejects everything else as "not me"; it becomes subject to a series of afflictions such as: pride, egoism, competitiveness, hate and jealousy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though ahaṃkāra is generally a state of illusion, once in that state, ''Vak tattva'' (one of the 36 tattvas) can appear. When it does, then, for the first time, individual will, determination, a sense of morality and ethics come into play - which is the first step on the path to spiritual development/enlightenment. Without a sufficiently harmonious and powerful ahaṃkāra (personality), it is thought to be impossible to exert the level of effort necessary to accede to a higher spiritual level.

The position of ahaṃkāra and buddhi are sometimes presented in reversed order because, as the principle of "I-ness", ahaṃkāra is allowed control over the manas (sensorial mind) and buddhi (superior intellect, intuition). Yet, buddhi is a superior tattva, and ahaṃkāra is thus only able to be in a superior position to buddhi from a functional point of view. From an absolute point of view, ahaṃkāra is created by buddhi and thus subordinate to it.

'''Alison Turnbull Hopkins''' (May 20, 1880 – March 18, 1951) was an American suffrage activist, known as one of the "[[Silent Sentinels]]" for her protests at the [[White House]].

==Early life and education==
Alison Low Turnbull was born in 1880, to Frank and Marion Louise Bates Turnbull, in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mchc.morriscountynj.gov/exhibits/women/ Morris County Heritage Commission, "Celebrating Exceptional Women from Morris County’s Past," online exhibit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a naval officer. She was privately tutored and received no other schooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a783AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;ots=JcZzAOjmnj&amp;dq=Alison%20Low%20Turnbull%20Hopkins%20suffrage&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage ''Scannell's New Jersey's First Citizens and State Guide'' (J.

==Activism==
Alison Turnbull Hopkins was on the executive board of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] and was New Jersey state chair for the [[National Woman's Party]]. She was also active in local Morristown charities and women's clubs, and was a member of [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]], a women's debating club based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0_din50DrdcC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Alison%20Turnbull%20Hopkins&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage Bárbara Ozieblo, ''Susan Glaspell: A Critical Biography'' (University of North Carolina Press 2000): 138.] {{ISBN|9780807848685}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Woman's Party leader, she campaigned against [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the 1916 presidential election, while her husband campaigned for Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/97866469/46432BDFA4E54410PQ/7 "Husband and Wife Divided on Wilson: Mrs. Hopkins, Whose Progressive Spouse is for Him, Takes the Other side," ''New York Times'' (August 15, 1916): 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among her notable political stunts was a speaking tour through Illinois in a car bearing the slogan "Don't Vote for Wilson," following [[William Jennings Bryan]] on his lecture tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/174106823/46432BDFA4E54410PQ/29 "Women's Party to Trail Bryan on Illinois Trip: Feminine Orators Will Hold Street Meetings to Offset Nebraskan's Pleas," ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (October 24, 1916): 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/174105533/46432BDFA4E54410PQ/27 "Taunting Mr. Bryan: Here are Women who Drove their 'Don't Vote for Wilson' Car behind Commoner's at Springfield," ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (October 30, 1916): 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bastille Day]] in 1917, she was part of a group of suffrage protesters arrested at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2041457/suffrage_arrests_1917/ "16 Suffragists Under Arrest," ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'' (July 14, 1917): 1.] via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was sentenced to jail at [[Occoquan Workhouse]], but she was pardoned after three days by [[Woodrow Wilson]], at the request of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-GGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Alison%20Low%20Turnbull%20Hopkins%20suffrage&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage Doris Stevens, ''Jailed for Freedom'' (Boni and Liveright 1920): 362.]&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to her White House protest after this incident, displaying signs that read "We ask not pardon for ourselves but justice for all American women"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UqUE9GVcF6wC&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=Alison%20Turnbull%20Hopkins&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage Katherine H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">A '''battle of egos''' is a phrase used [[metaphor]]ically to describe competitions that are based on [[pride]] and often entail prodigious and arrogant demonstrations of prowess. A type of [[duel]]ing similar to a [[pissing contest]], [[Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego|ego]] battles are often seen as an arrogant way to determine who is the "bigger man" (as far as being superior right in an argument) by a competitive [[methodology]] that is not especially productive. The [[idiom]] is usually used [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]]ly and often refer to forms of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]-driven battling in a [[pejorative]] manner.

==Ego battles==
A [[Tehran]] newspaper described the dispute between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] as a battle of egos.&lt;ref&gt;"In the battle of egos between (George W.) Bush and Saddam (Hussein), it seems that the real losers will be the citizens of Iraq and the United States."

A cognitive description specifies what information is utilized during a cognitive action, how this information is processed and transformed, what data structures are used, and what behaviour is generated.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in Barkow, Jerome H., Cosmides, Leda, Tooby, John, (1992) ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}}, page 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communal violence''' is a form of violence that is perpetrated across [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or communal lines, the violent parties feel solidarity for their respective groups, and victims are chosen based upon group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) ''The Deadly Ethnic Riot''. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes conflicts, riots and other forms of violence between communities of different religious faith or ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/communal Communal] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime includes any conflict and form of violence between communities of different religious group, different sects or tribes of same religious group, clans, ethnic origins or national origin as communal violence.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/Chapter_4.pdf Homicide, Violence and Conflict] UNODC, United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; However, this excludes conflict between two individuals or two families.

The term was constructed by the British colonial authorities as it wrestled to manage violence between religious, ethnic and disparate groups in its colonies, particularly Africa and South Asia, in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=gvk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arafaat A.

Communal violence, in different parts of the world, is alternatively referred to as ethnic violence, non-State conflict, violent civil unrest, minorities unrest, mass racial violence, inter-communal violence and ethno-religious violence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Horowitz (1985), Ethnic Groups in Conflict, {{ISBN|978-0520053854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Europe
Human history has experienced numerous episodes of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;David Nirenberg, Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medieval Europe, Protestants clashed with Catholics, Christians clashed with Muslims while both perpetuated violence against Jews and [[Romani people|Roma]] minorities. In 1561, [[Huguenot]]s in Toulouse took out in a procession through the streets to express their solidarity for Protestant ideas. A few days later, the Catholics hunted down some of the leaders of the procession, beat them and burned them at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Jean Souriac]], "Du corps à corps au combat fictif. Quand les catholiques toulousains affrontaient leurs homologues protestants," in Les affrontements: Usages, discours et rituels, Editor: Frédérique Pitou and Jacqueline Sainclivier, Presses Universitaires de Rennes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the French town of Pamiers, communal clashes were routine between Protestants and Catholics, such as during holy celebrations where the Catholics took out a procession with a statue of St. Anthony, sang and danced while they carried the statue around town. Local Protestants would year after year disrupt the festivities by throwing stones at the Catholics. In 1566, when the Catholic procession reached a Protestant neighborhood, the Protestants chanted "kill, kill, kill !!" and days of communal violence with numerous fatalities followed.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruff, Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500–1800, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1572, thousands of Protestants were killed by Catholics during communal violence in each of the following cities – Paris, Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyon, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partner, P. 1999"/&gt; In Switzerland, communal violence between the Reformation movement and Catholics marked the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gordon (2002), The Swiss Reformation, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719051180}}, pp. 90–99&lt;/ref&gt;

;Africa
The Horn of Africa as well as West African regions have similar history of communal violence. Nigeria has seen centuries of communal violence between different ethnic groups particularly between Christian south and Islamic north.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20045621 The Clash of Civilizations?], Foreign Affairs, Vol. 72, No. 3 (Summer, 1993), pp. 22–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desplat &amp; Ostebo (2013), Muslim Ethiopia: The Christian Legacy, Identity Politics, and Islamic Reformism, {{ISBN|978-1137325297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, after receiving independence from the British colonial rule, there were widespread communal violence in the ethnically diverse state of [[Zanzibar]]. The violent groups were Arabs and Africans, that expanded along religious lines, and the communal violence ultimately led to the overthrow of the Sultan of Zanzibar.&lt;ref name="nyt14jan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conley | first = Robert | title = Regime Banishes Sultan | newspaper=New York Times | pages = 4 | date = 14 January 1964  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/14/archives/regime-banishes-sultan.html| accessdate = 16 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Parsons|first=Timothy|title=The 1964 Army Mutinies and the Making of Modern East Africa|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoLbjlIYLzwC|isbn=0-325-07068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local radio announced the death of tens of thousands of "stooges", but later estimates for deaths from Zanzibar communal violence have varied from hundreds to 2,000-4,000 to as many as 20,000.&lt;ref name="nyt19jan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conley | first = Robert | title = Nationalism Is Viewed as Camouflage for Reds | newspaper=New York Times | pages = 1 | date = 19 January 1964  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/19/nationalism-is-viewed-as-camouflage-for-redstoll-2000-to-4000.html| accessdate = 16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{Citation | last = Los Angeles Times | title = Slaughter in Zanzibar of Asians, Arabs Told | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | pages = 4 | date = 20 January 1964 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/465909962.html?dids=465909962:465909962&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+20%2C+1964&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=4&amp;desc=Slaughter+in+Zanzibar+of+Asians%2C+Arabs+Told | accessdate = 16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1960s and early 1970s, there were widespread communal violence against Kenyans and Asians in [[Uganda]] with waves of theft, physical and sexual violence, followed by expulsions by [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasozi, Abdu Basajabaka Kawalya; Musisi, Nakanyike; Sejjengo, James Mukooza (1994).

;Asia
[[File:Communal trouble also erupts in Ahmedabad, between Muslims and Jains.jpg|thumb|Arson and communal violence of 1946 between Muslims and Jains, in [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat.]]
East, South and Southeast Asia have recorded numerous instances of communal violence. For example, Singapore suffered a wave of communal violence in 20th century between Malays and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Leifer, Michael (1964), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642213 Communal violence in Singapore], Asian Survey, Vol. 4, No. 10 (Oct., 1964), 1115–1121&lt;/ref&gt; In Indian subcontinent, numerous 18th through 20th century records of the British colonial era mention communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, as well as Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, particularly during processions related to respective religious celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Bayly, C. A. (1985), The Pre-history of Communalism? Religious Conflict in India  1700–1860, Modern Asian Studies, 19 (02), pp. 177–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baber, Z. (2004), Race, Religion and Riots: The ‘Racialization’ of Communal Identity and Conflict in India, Sociology, 38(4), pp. 701–718&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of communal violence in South Asia increased after the first partition of Bengal in 1905, where segregation, unequal political and economic rights were imposed on Hindus and Muslims by Lord Curzon, based on religion. The colonial rule was viewed by each side as favoring the other side, resulting in a wave of communal riots and 1911 reversal of Bengal partition and its re-unification.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Cronin (1977), British Policy and Administration in Bengal, 1905–1912: Partition and the New Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, {{ISBN|978-0836400007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, after British General Dyer ordered his soldiers to fire on unarmed protestors inside a compound in Amritsar, killing 380 civilians, communal violence followed in India against British settlements.&lt;ref&gt;DRAPER, A. (1981), Amritsar – The Massacre that Ended the Raj, Littlehampton, {{ISBN|978-0304304813}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were hundreds of incidents of communal violence between 1905 and 1947, many related to religious, political sovereignty questions including partition of India along religious lines into East Pakistan, West Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;PANDEY, G. (1983),␣in Editor: GUHA, R., 1983, Subaltern Studies II: Writings on South Asian History and Society, Delhi, Oxford University Press, pp. 60–129, {{ISBN|978-0195633658}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1946 to 1947 period saw some of the worst communal violence of 20th century, where waves of riots and violence killed between 100,000 and a million people, from Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Jain religions, particularly in cities and towns near the modern borders of India-Pakistan and India-Bangladesh. Examples of these communal violence include the so-called [[Direct Action Day]], [[Noakhali riots]] and the [[Partition riots in Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref&gt;BRISTOW, R.C.B.

==National laws==

===India===
The Indian law defines communal violence as, "any act or series of acts, whether spontaneous or planned, resulting in injury or harm to the person and or property, knowingly directed against any person by virtue of his or her membership of any religious or linguistic minority, in any State in the Union of India, or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of clauses (24) and (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf PREVENTION OF COMMUNAL AND TARGETED VIOLENCE (ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND REPARATIONS) BILL, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814185325/http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf |date=2014-08-14 }} Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, communal violence is defined as that is driven by a sense of religious, ethnic or tribal solidarity. The equivalence of tribalism to ethnicity was referred locally as ''kesukuan''.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia – Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Communal violence in Indonesia includes numerous localized conflicts between various social groups found on its islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html Social violence in Indonesia is localized] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104117/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html |date=2016-03-04 }} Jakarta Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, communal violence is defined as that violence that occurs between different community who identify themselves based on religion, tribes, language, sect, race and others. Typically this sense of community identity comes from birth and is inherited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ACLED-Country-Report_Kenya_December-2013.pdf COUNTRY REPORT: KENYA – 2013] ACLED, Africa (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar definition has been applied for 47 African countries, where during 1990–2010, about 7,200 instances of communal violence and inter-ethnic conflicts has been seen.&lt;ref&gt;Idean Salehyan et al, Social Conflict in Africa: A New Database, International Interactions: Empirical and Theoretical Research in International Relations, Volume 38, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Cyprus Greek Turk Communal Violence at Ktima, Paphos.jpg|thumb|Damage from communal violence between Christian Greeks and Muslim Turks in [[Cyprus]].]]
Colm Campbell has proposed, after studying the empirical data and sequence of events during communal violence in South Africa, Palestinian Territories and Northern Ireland, that communal violence typically follows when there is degradation of rule of law, the state fails to or is widely seen as unable to provide order, security and equal justice, which then leads to mass mobilization, followed by radicalization of anger among one or more communities, and ultimately violent mobilization. Targeted mass violence by a few from one community against innocent members of other community, suppression of complaints, refusal to prosecute, killing peaceful demonstrators, imprisonment of people of a single community while refusal to arrest members of other community in conflict, perceived or actual prisoner abuse by the state are often the greatest mobilizers of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Campbell (2011), 'Beyond Radicalization: Towards an Integrated Anti-Violence Rule of Law Strategy', Transitional Justice Institute Research Paper No. 11-05, in Salinas de Friás, KLH Samuel and ND White (eds), Counter-Terrorism: International Law and Practice (Oxford University Press, Oxford 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stewart, Horizontal Inequalities and Conflict: Understanding Group Violence in Multiethnic Societies, {{ISBN|978-0230245501}}, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that ethnic segregation may also cause communal violence. Empirically estimating the effect of segregation on the incidence of violence across 700 localities in Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]] after the contested 2007–2008 general election, Kimuli Kahara finds that local ethnic segregation increases communal violence by decreasing interethnic trust rather than by making it easier to organize violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a small minority of individuals prefer to live in ethnically homogenous settings due to fear of other ethnic groups or otherwise, it can result in high degrees of ethnic segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|date=1971|title=Dynamic Models of Segregation|url=|journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=143–186|doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahara argues that such ethnic segregation decreases the possibility of positive contact across ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence? Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration and the resultant positive interethnic contact reduces prejudice by allowing individuals to correct false beliefs about members of other ethnic groups, improving intergroup relations consequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, segregation is correlated with low levels of interethnic trust. This widespread mistrust along ethnic lines explains the severity of communal violence by implying that when underlying mistrust is high, it is easier for extremists and elites to mobilize support for violence, and that where violence against members of other ethnic groups is supported by the public, perpetrators of such violence are less likely to face social sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}

'''Critique''' is a [[wikt:method|method]] of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral [[discourse]]. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment,&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"&gt;[[Rodolphe Gasché]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CZVDv6bdXIC&amp;pg=PA12 ''The honor of thinking: critique, theory, philosophy''] pp. 12–13 quote: {{quotation|Let us also remind ourselves of the fact that throughout the eighteenth century, which Kant, in ''Critique of Pure Reason'', labeled "in especial degree, the age of criticism" and to which our use of "critique", today remains largely indebted, critique was above all critique of prejudice and established authority, and hence was intimately tied to a conception of the human being as capable of self-thinking, hence authonomous, and free from religious and political authorities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt; The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt;

The term ''critique'' derives, via French, from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κριτική}} ({{transl|grc|ISO|kritikē}}), meaning "the faculty of judgment", that is, discerning the value of persons or things.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|critick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critique is also known as major [[logic]], as opposed to minor [[logic]] or [[dialectic]]s.

== Critique in philosophy ==
Philosophy is the application of critical thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and is the disciplined practice of processing the ''theory/praxis problem''. In [[philosophy|philosophical]] contexts, such as law or academics, critique is most influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s use of the term to mean a reflective examination of the validity and limits of a human capacity or of a set of philosophical claims. This has been extended in [[modern philosophy]] to mean a systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a [[concept]], a [[theory]], a [[discipline]], or an approach and/or attempt to understand the limitations and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of that. A ''critical perspective'', in this sense, is the opposite of a [[dogma]]tic one. Kant wrote:

{{quote|We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' section 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later thinkers such as [[Hegel]] used the word 'critique' in a broader way than Kant's sense of the word, to mean the systematic inquiry into the limits of a [[doctrine]] or ''set'' of concepts. This referential expansion led, for instance, to the formulation of the idea of social critique, such as arose after [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical work delineated in his [[Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]] (1859), which was a critique of the then-current models of economic theory and thought of that time. Further critique can then be applied after the fact, by using thorough critique as a basis for new argument. The idea of ''critique'' is elemental to legal, aesthetic, and literary theory and such practices, such as in the analysis and evaluation of [[writing]]s such as pictorial, musical, or expanded textual works.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of philosophical conceptions of critique from Spinoza to Rancière see K. de Boer and R. Sonderegger (eds.), ''Conceptions of Critique in Modern and Contemporary Philosophy'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique vs criticism ==
In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and '[[criticism]]': the two words both translate as ''critique'', ''Kritik'', and ''critica'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"&gt;[[Gianni Vattimo]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=i7QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 ''Postmodern criticism: postmodern critique''] in David Wood (1990) ''Writing the future'', pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; In the English language, according to philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]], ''criticism'' is used more frequently to denote [[literary criticism]] or [[art criticism]], that is the interpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while ''critique'' may be used to refer to more general and profound writing as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of pure reason]]''.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; Another proposed distinction is that critique is never personalized nor [[ad hominem]], but is instead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item critiqued.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a rebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the topic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe there might be a distinction suggest that there is some ambiguity that is still unresolved.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt;

==Critical theory==
{{main|Critical theory}}
Marx's work inspired the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of  [[critical theory]], now best exemplified in the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ingram, ''Habermas: Introduction and Analysis'', New York: Cornell University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, helped inspire the [[cultural studies]] form of social critique, which treats cultural products and their reception as evidence of wider social ills such as [[racism]] or [[gender bias]]. Social critique has been further extended in the work of [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Was ist Kritik?'', Berlin: Merve Verlag 1992. {{ISBN|3-88396-093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', Notre Dame: University of Notre Dama Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In their different and radically contrasting ways, MacIntyre and Foucault go well beyond the original Kantian meaning of the term ''critique'' in contesting legitimatory accounts of social power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">'''Erling Hall-Hofsø''' (11 January 1917 – 20 May 2010) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and politician for the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]].

In his young days he was a [[amateur boxing|boxer]] for the workers' sports club Harstad AIF. He became a member of the central board of the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] in 1938. In 1946 he was hired as a journalist in the Labour newspaper in [[Harstad]], ''[[Folkeviljen]]''. He was promoted to editor-in-chief already in 1947. He remained here until 1956, when the newspaper was incorporated by [[Tromsø]]-based newspaper ''[[Nordlys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erling Hall-Hofsø til minne|last=Nielsen|first=Reidar|date=25 May 2010|work=Fremover Nordlys|page=7|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall-Hofsø became famous in 1953. His newspaper printed a short piece about an attempted [[rape]] which had occurred in Harstad. The police demanded that Hall-Hofsø unveil his [[Journalism sourcing|source]] for the news story, but he refused. He was sentenced to jail for maximum three months, with the option of being released if he unveiled his source. The case went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Norway]], who sided with the prosecutors.&lt;ref name=prison&gt;{{cite news|title=Pressehistorisk jubilant|last=|first=|date=11 October 2007|work=Harstad Tidende|page=|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seventeen days of imprisonment, Hall-Hofsø was released on 3 March 1953 because the source stood forward.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=En pressemann er død|last=|first=|date=21 May 2010|work=Harstad Tidende|page=3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter in Martin Eide's book ''Den redigerende makt'' is devoted to the incident.&lt;ref name=prison/&gt;

After ''Folkeviljen'' was amalgamated into ''Nordlys'', he became leader of the newspaper's Harstad office. He retired in 1987. He was also involved in politics, as a member of [[Sandtorg]] [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] from 1948 to 1960, Harstad municipal council from 1960 to 1978 and [[Troms]] [[county council (Norway)|county council]] from 1968 to 1972. He also chaired the local school board for four years, and was an honorary member of the Labour Party. He co-founded the [[Festival of North Norway]] in 1963, and was chairman of its board for the first six years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He died in January 2010.&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;{{cite news|title=Døde i går|last=|first=|date=21 May 2010|work=Nordlys|page=12|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">An '''extraterritorial operation''' in [[international law]] is a [[law enforcement]] or [[military]] [[military operation|operation]] conducted outside the territory or [[jurisdiction]] of the state of the forces in operation, generally within the territory of another sovereign state. Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a [[state (polity)|state]]'s [[sovereignty]] if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=16-17}}
{{cquote|The first and foremost restriction imposed by international law on a State is that—failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary—it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State.|author=[[Permanent Court of International Justice]], 1923&lt;ref name=PCIJ&gt;S.S. Lotus (Fr. v. Turk.), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 10, ¶ 45 (Sept. 7); quoted in {{harvnb|Stigall|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Law enforcement ==
The policing of [[transnational crime|transnational]] and [[International criminal law|international crime]]s is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention "tantamount to abduction" when carried out extraterritorially.{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=18}} These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as [[Interpol]] to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]'' ("[[extradition|extradite]] or prosecute") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of [[civil aviation|civilian aircraft]], taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of [[terrorism]], as well as crimes against [[diplomat]]s and other "[[Protection of Diplomats Convention|internationally protected persons]]".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|pp=19-21}}

== Military operations ==
While extraterritorial law enforcement activity is highly restricted and subject to the approval of the 'host' state, traditional interstate military operations assume some degree of extraterritorial operation. As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (''[[jus ad bellum]]'') is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the [[laws of armed conflict]] "[presuppose] extraterritoriality".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Therefore, "[i]f the circumstances exist for the 
lawful use of force under ''jus ad bellum'', then so long as a state abides by the rules articulated in ''[[Law of war|jus in bello]]'' [the law of war], that state’s extraterritorial actions are considered lawful."{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}}

=== "Unwilling or unable" ===
Problems with the legitimacy of extraterritorial operations arise, according to Stigall, when one state is conducting military activity against non-state actors in a state "that is not party to the conflict".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31}} Although some commentators suggest that the use of force is permitted in some of these cases, with Deeks' commentary on the 'Unwilling or Unable Test' mentioning sources that recommend that "neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent",{{sfn|Deeks|2012|p=499}} Stigall reminds "that such view is not universal, and textual authority for such cross-border attacks is limited".{{sfn|Stigall|2013|p=31-32}}

=== Humanitarian and human rights law ===
For the [[European Union]], key tenets of its [[human rights law]] jurisdiction are laid down in [[Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), with the convention employed to complement and reinforce the more specific scope of [[international humanitarian law|humanitarian law]].{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}{{efn|"This should be enough to dispel the assumption that, wherever human rights treaties such as the ECHR apply extra-territorially in situations of armed conflict and occupation, their effect could be curtailed by the more limited humanitarian law protection."{{sfn|Orakhelashvili|2012|p=2}}}} The application of this to extraterritorial operations has been noted by Ryngaert as mixed, with ''Al-Skeini and others v United Kingdom'' in 2011 attempting "to square ''Bankovic ''[''v. Belgium'''s "sufficient control" model of jurisdiction] with the personal model of jurisdiction",{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}{{sfn|Holcroft-Emmess|2013}} and ''Al-Jedda v United Kingdom'' "tried to reconcile the ‘ultimate control and authority’ standard... with  the ‘effective operational control’ standard endorsed by the UN’s International Law Commission."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}} Ryngaert declares each of the two results to be "an awkward hybrid theory".{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}
&lt;!--"for those who brandish human rights, it is difficult to accept that States may do abroad what they are not allowed to do inside their borders."{{sfn|Ryngaert|2012|p=60}}--&gt;

[[Image:FTGbord Leuven 1.jpg|thumb|right|Sign announcing the Belgian city of [[Leuven]]'s Fair Trade Town status|300px]]

The '''Fair Trade Towns''' campaign is the result of a grass-roots citizens movement that started in the UK in 2001 (see below). It allows citizens to get together in order to self-proclaim their town (or other local geographical area) as a region that complies with a few general Fair Trade criteria, that can be adapted from country to country but which retain their main elements.

In some countries, the '''Fair Trade Town''' became a status awarded by a recognized Fair Trade certification body (i.e. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[TransFair Canada]] in [[Canada]] etc.) describing an area which is committed to the promotion of [[Fair Trade certification|Fair Trade certified]] goods. By extension, the organizations also award the statuses of '''Fair Trade City''', '''Fair Trade Village''', '''Fair Trade Zone''', '''Fair Trade Borough''', '''Fair Trade Island''', '''Fair Trade Country''' and '''Fair Trade University'''.

== History ==
The Fair Trade Town campaign was first launched in 2001 in [[Garstang]], [[Lancashire]], under the initiative of Bruce Crowther, a local [[Oxfam]] supporter, and the Garstang Oxfam Group. The initiative, which aimed to promote Fair Trade certified goods in the town, was highly successful: within a couple of months, awareness of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade Mark]] jumped to over 70% in the town while sales of Fairtrade certified goods increased significantly. Moreover, over the course of the campaign, Garstang developed links with Fair Trade cocoa farming communities in West Africa, which led to the [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin town]] relationship with [[New Koforidua]], [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;Garstang Fair Trade Town (2002).

As the activities at Garstang gained wider attention, the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] launched a set of Fair Trade Town Goals and an Action Guide to encourage others to follow in the town's success. During the 2001-2006 period, over 209 British towns were awarded the Fair Trade status by the Fairtrade Foundation. In October 2009 448 British towns and 312 towns worldwide awarded the Fair Trade status (in total 760). In November 2012, there were over 1200 worldwide.

In an attempt to replicate the success of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]]'s Fairtrade Town program, a Europe-wide program called "Fair Trade Towns in Europe", part-funded by the [[European Commission]], was launched jointly by several Fair Trade labelling initiatives.

In November 2006, the first ever European Fair Trade Towns conference was hosted at London Southbank University. The goals of the conference were to
*identify and develop procedures to strengthen the links within and between local communities and private and public organisations;
*develop strategies to enable the UK Fair Trade Towns model to meet the requirements of each individual country.

Following the success of the first event, a second Fair Trade towns conference was subsequently held in Brussels in January 2008. The sixth conference was held in Poznan (Poland) in November 2012, and the 2013 and 2014 international conferences are foreseen to take place in Oslo (Norway) and Kumamoto (Japan), respectively.

There are currently Fair Trade Towns in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. The [[list of Fairtrade settlements]] is a more comprehensive current list.

== Criteria ==
[[Image:Wolfville-fair-trade-sm.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sign announcing [[Wolfville]]'s (Canada) Fair Trade Town status]]

Formal guidelines have been produced jointly by several [[FLO International|FLO]] member Fairtrade labelling initiatives. In order to be awarded [[Fair Trade]] status, an area must meet five criteria (exact numbers and proportions vary from country to country):

* Local council passes a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] supporting [[Fair Trade]], and agrees to serve Fair Trade [[tea]] and [[coffee]] at its meetings and in its [[office]]s and [[canteen (place)|canteen]]s.
* A range of (at least two) Fair Trade products is readily available in the area’s [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]] and local [[café]]s/[[catering]] establishments.
** Target for number of retail outlets: population of &lt; 10000 - 1 retail outlet per 2500; population &lt; 200000 - 1 retail outlet per 5000; population of &lt; 500000 - 1 retail outlet per 10000.
** Target for number of catering outlets: population of &lt; 10000 - 1 catering outlet per 5000; population &lt; 200000 - 1 catering outlet per 10000; population of &lt; 500000 - 1 catering outlet per 20000
* Fair Trade products are used by a number of local work places ([[estate agent]]s, [[hairdresser]]s, etc.) and community organisations ([[Church (building)|church]]es, [[school]]s, etc.)
* Attract [[Mass media|media]] coverage and popular support for the campaign.
* A local Fair Trade steering group is convened to ensure continued commitment to its Fair Trade Town status.

== Other initiatives ==
In 2002 The [[Wales]] Fair Trade Forum, a network of development NGOs and Fair Trade campaigners, began working to make Wales the world's first Fair Trade country.  The idea was based upon the Fair Trade Town scheme run by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK.  In 2005 The [[Welsh Assembly Government]] agreed to back the idea and in 2006 Fair Trade groups from [[Scotland]] and Wales agreed the criteria for becoming a Fair Trade country.

The draft criteria for a "Fair Trade Nation" are:[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/fair-trade]
* 75% of the population should purchase a Fair Trade product every year.
* 40% of people regularly buy Fair Trade products.
* All local authorities have active Fair Trade groups working towards Fair Trade status.
* 55% local authority areas with Fair Trade status with 10% annual increase in following years

Wales became the world's first Fair Trade nation in June 2008.

Outside the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], free [[neutron]]s are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|881.5|1.5|u=[[second|s]]}} (about 14 minutes, 42 seconds). Therefore, the [[half-life]] for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of {{nowrap|[[Natural logarithm|ln]](2) ≈ 0.693}}) is {{val|611|1|u=s}} (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).&lt;ref name="Particle data group"&gt;J. Beringer et al. (Particle Data Group), Phys. Rev. D86, 010001 (2012) http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/tables/rpp2012-sum-baryons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[beta decay]] of the neutron, described above, can be denoted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons]. lbl.gov (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

This decay, like any [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]-changing process, occurs through operation of the [[weak interaction|weak force]]. It involves the emission of a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} boson from one of the [[down quark]]s within the neutron, thereby converting the down quark into an [[up quark]] and the neutron into a proton; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} then decays into the [[electron]] and the [[electron antineutrino|antineutrino]]. The following equations denote the same process as the first equation above, but also include the short-lived {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and describe the process on both the [[nucleon]] and the [[quark]] level:
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

:{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Up quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Down quark|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}}

For the free neutron, the [[decay energy]] for this process (based on the [[rest mass]]es of the neutron, proton and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. That is the difference between the rest mass of the neutron and the sum of the rest masses of the products. That difference has to be carried away as [[kinetic energy]]. The maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 ± .013 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Ideas and Concepts in Nuclear Physics: An Introductory Approach, Third Edition
K. Heyde Taylor &amp; Francis 2004. Print {{ISBN|978-0-7503-0980-6}}. eBook {{ISBN|978-1-4200-5494-1}}. DOI: 10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 ([http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 full text]).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the [[neutrino]] (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy); furthermore, neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods.

A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted [[gamma ray]]:

:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0|link=yes}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Photon|link=yes}}

This gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of "internal [[bremsstrahlung]]" that arises as the emitted beta particle (electron) interacts with the [[electric charge|charge]] of the proton in an electromagnetic way. In this process, some of the decay energy is carried away as [[photon energy]]. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons, that is, those within a nucleus.

A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the "two bodies"). In this type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body").

The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton.

==Neutron lifetime puzzle==

While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of [[consilience]] on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods ("bottle" versus "beam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/ |title=Neutron Lifetime Puzzle Deepens, but No Dark Matter Seen |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |date=13 February 2018 |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |access-date=31 July 2018 |quote=When physicists strip neutrons from atomic nuclei, put them in a bottle, then count how many remain there after some time, they infer that neutrons radioactively decay in 14 minutes and 39 seconds, on average. But when other physicists generate beams of neutrons and tally the emerging protons — the particles that free neutrons decay into — they peg the average neutron lifetime at around 14 minutes and 48 seconds. The discrepancy between the “bottle” and “beam” measurements has persisted since both methods of gauging the neutron’s longevity began yielding results in the 1990s. At first, all the measurements were so imprecise that nobody worried. Gradually, though, both methods have improved, and still they disagree.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Overview ==
Fusion adaptive resonance theory models is a natural extension of the original [[Adaptive resonance theory|adaptive resonance theory (ART)]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Grossberg, S. (1987), Competitive learning: From interactive activation to adaptive resonance, Cognitive Science (Publication), 11, 23-63&lt;/ref&gt; models developed by [[Stephen Grossberg]] and [[Gail Carpenter|Gail A. Carpenter]] from a single pattern field to multiple pattern channels. Whereas the original ART models perform unsupervised learning of recognition nodes in response to incoming input patterns, fusion ART learns multi-channel mappings simultaneously across multi-modal pattern channels in an [[online machine learning|online]] and [[incremental learning|incremental]] manner.

== The learning model ==
Fusion ART employs a multi-channel architecture (as shown below), comprising a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; connected to a fixed number of (''K'') pattern channels or input fields &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c1},\dots,F_1^{cK}&lt;/math&gt; through bidirectional conditionable pathways. The model unifies a number of network designs, most notably Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), Adaptive Resonance Associative Map (ARAM)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1995|title=Adaptive Resonance Associative Map|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/ARAM%20NN95.pdf|journal=Neural Networks|volume=8|issue=3|pages=437–446|last1=Tan|first1=A.-H.|doi=10.1016/0893-6080(94)00092-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fusion Architecture for Learning and COgNition (FALCON),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2008|title=Integrating Temporal Difference Methods and Self-Organizing Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning with Delayed Evaluative Feedback|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/2008/TD-FALCON%20TNN%2004359212.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=2|pages=230–244|author1=Tan, A.-H., Lu, N. |author2=Xiao, D }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed over the past decades for a wide range of functions and applications.

[[File:Fusion ART Architecture.jpg|frameless|500x500px]]

Given a set of multimodal patterns, each presented at a pattern channel, the fusion ART pattern encoding cycle comprises five key stages, namely code activation, code competition, activity readout, template matching, and template learning, as described below.
* '''Code activation:''' Given the input activity vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{I}^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;, one for each input field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;, the choice function &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; of each &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''j'' is computed based on the combined overall similarity between the input patterns and the corresponding weight vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_j^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Code competition:''' A code competition process follows under which the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node with the highest choice function value is identified. The winner is indexed at ''J'' where &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum among all &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; nodes. This indicates a winner-take-all strategy.
* '''Activity readout:''' During memory recall, the chosen &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''J'' performs a read out of its weight vectors to the input fields &lt;math&gt;F_1^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Template matching:''' Before the activity readout is stabilized and node ''J'' can be used for learning, a template matching process checks that the weight templates of node ''J'' are sufficiently close to their respective input patterns. Specifically, resonance occurs if for each channel ''k'', the ''match function'' of the chosen node ''J'' meets its vigilance criterion.If any of the vigilance constraints is violated, mismatch reset occurs in which the value of the choice function &lt;math&gt;T_J&lt;/math&gt; is set to 0 for the duration of the input presentation. Using a ''match tracking'' process, at the beginning of each input presentation, the vigilance parameter in each channel ''ck'' equals a baseline vigilance. When a mismatch reset occurs, the vigilance of all pattern channels are increased simultaneously until one of them is slightly larger than its corresponding match function, causing a reset. The search process then selects another &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''J'' under the revised vigilance criterion until a resonance is achieved.
* '''Template learning:''' Once a resonance occurs, for each channel ''ck'', the weight vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_J^{ck}&lt;/math&gt; is modified according to a learning rule which moves it towards the input pattern. When an uncommitted node is selected for learning, it becomes ''committed'' and a new uncommitted node is added to the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; field. Fusion ART thus expands its network architecture dynamically in response to the input patterns.

== Types of fusion ART ==
The network dynamics described above can be used to support numerous learning operations. We show how fusion ART can be used for a variety of traditionally distinct learning tasks in the subsequent sections.

=== Original ART models ===
With a single pattern channel, the fusion ART architecture reduces to the original ART model. Using a selected vigilance value $\rho$, an ART model learns a set of recognition nodes in response to an incoming stream of input patterns in a continuous manner. Each recognition node in the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; field learns to encode a template pattern representing the key characteristics of a set of patterns. ART has been widely used in the context of unsupervised learning for discovering pattern groupings. Please refer to the selected ART literatures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; for a review of ART's functionalities, interpretations, and applications.

=== Adaptive resonance associative map ===
By synchronizing pattern coding across multiple pattern channels, fusion ART learns to encode associative mappings across distinct pattern spaces. A specific instance of fusion ART with two pattern channels is known as adaptive resonance associative map (ARAM), that learns multi-dimensional supervised mappings from one pattern space to another pattern space. An ARAM system consists of an input field &lt;math&gt;F_1^a&lt;/math&gt;,  an output field &lt;math&gt;F_1^b&lt;/math&gt;, and a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;. Given a set of feature vectors presented at &lt;math&gt;F_1^a&lt;/math&gt; with their corresponding class vectors presented at &lt;math&gt;F_1^b&lt;/math&gt;, ARAM learns a predictive model (encoded by the
recognition nodes in &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;) that associates combinations of key features to their respective classes.

Fuzzy ARAM, based on fuzzy ART operations, has been successfully applied to numerous machine learning tasks, including personal profiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Soon | first2 = H.-S. | year = 2000 | title =  | url = | journal = proceedings, Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD'00), LNAI | volume = 1805 | issue = | pages = 173–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; document classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = J. | last2 = Tan | first2 = A.-H. | last3 = Tan | first3 = C.-L. | year = 2003 | title = On Machine Learning Methods for Chinese Document Classification | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/TC%20APIN03.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Applied Intelligence | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 311–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; personalized content management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Ong | first2 = H.-L. | last3 = Pan | first3 = H. | last4 = Ng | first4 = J. | last5 = Li | first5 = Q.-X. | year = 2004 | title = Towards Personalized Web Intelligence | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/TC%20APIN03.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Knowledge and Information Systems | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 595–616 | doi=10.1007/s10115-003-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DNA gene expression analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Pan | first2 =  | year = 2005 | title = Predictive Neural Networks for Gene Expression Data Analysis | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/Predictive%20NN%20for%20Gene%20Expression%20Analysis.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 297–306 | doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2005.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many benchmark experiments, ARAM has demonstrated predictive performance superior to those of many state-of-the-art machine learning systems, including C4.5, Backpropagation Neural Network, K Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machines.

=== Fusion ART with domain knowledge ===
During learning, fusion ART formulates recognition categories of input patterns across multiple channels. The knowledge that fusion ART discovers during learning, is compatible with symbolic rule-based representation. Specifically, the recognition categories learned by the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; category nodes are compatible with a class of IF-THEN rules that maps a set of input attributes (antecedents) in one pattern channel to a disjoint set of output attributes (consequents) in another channel. Due to this
compatibility, at any point of the [[incremental learning]] process, instructions in the form of IF-THEN rules can be readily translated into the recognition categories of a fusion ART system. The rules are conjunctive in the sense that the attributes in the
IF clause and in the THEN clause have an ''AND'' relationship. Augmenting a fusion ART network with domain knowledge through
explicit instructions serves to improve learning efficiency and predictive accuracy.

The fusion ART rule insertion strategy is similar to that used in Cascade ARTMAP, a generalization of ARTMAP that performs domain knowledge insertion, refinement, and extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=A.-H.|date=1997|title=Cascade ARTMAP: Integrating Neural Computation and Symbolic Knowledge Processing|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/Cascade%20ARTMAP-TNN97.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For direct knowledge insertion, the IF and THEN clauses of each instruction (rule) is translated into a pair of vectors A and B respectively. The vector pairs derived are then used
as training patterns for inserting into a fusion ART network. During rule insertion, the vigilance parameters are set to 1s to ensure that each distinct rule is encoded by one category node.

For details on integrating domain knowledge into fusion ART, please refer to a recent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teng | first1 = T.-H. | last2 = Tan | first2 = A.-H. | last3 = Zurada | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Self-Organizing Neural Networks Integrating Domain Knowledge and Reinforcement Learning | url = http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asahtan/Papers/2014/Self-Organizing%20Neural%20Network%20Integrating%20Domain%20Knowledge%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20TNNLS%202014.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 889–902 | doi=10.1109/tnnls.2014.2327636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fusion architecture for learning and cognition (FALCON) ===
Reinforcement learning is a paradigm wherein an autonomous system learns to adjust its behaviour based on
reinforcement signals received from the environment. An instance of fusion ART, known as FALCON (fusion architecture for learning and cognition), learns mappings simultaneously across multi-modal input patterns, involving states, actions, and rewards, in an [[online machine learning|online]] and [[incremental learning|incremental]] manner. Compared with other ART-based reinforcement learning systems, FALCON presents a truly
integrated solution in the sense that there is no implementation of a separate reinforcement learning module or Q-value table. Using competitive coding as the underlying principle of computation, the network dynamics encompasses several learning
paradigms, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning.

FALCON employs a three-channel architecture, comprising a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; and three pattern fields, namely a sensory field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c1}&lt;/math&gt; for representing current states, a motor field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c2}&lt;/math&gt; for representing actions, and a feedback field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c3}&lt;/math&gt; for representing reward values. A class of FALCON networks, known as TD-FALCON,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; incorporates Temporal Difference (TD) methods to estimate and learn value function ''Q(s,a)'', that indicates the goodness to take a certain action ''a'' in a given state ''s''.

The general sense-act-learn algorithm for TD-FALCON is summarized. Given the current state ''s'', the FALCON network is used to predict the value of performing each available action ''a'' in the action set A based on the corresponding state vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; and action vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;. The value functions are then processed by an action selection strategy (also known as policy) to select an action. Upon receiving a feedback (if any) from the environment after performing the
action, a TD formula is used to compute a new estimate of the Q-value for performing the chosen action in the current state. The new Q-value is then used as the teaching signal (represented as reward vector R) for FALCON to learn the association of the current state and the chosen action to the estimated value.

'''Gliding flight''' is heavier-than-air [[flight]] without the use of [[thrust]]; the term '''volplaning''' also refers to this mode of flight in animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/volplane volplane]. The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is employed by [[flying and gliding animals|gliding animals]] and by aircraft such as [[glider (aircraft)|gliders]]. This mode of flight involves flying a significant distance horizontally compared to its descent and therefore can be distinguished from a mostly straight downward descent like with a round parachute.

Although the human application of gliding flight usually refers to aircraft designed for this purpose, most powered aircraft are capable of gliding without engine power. As with sustained flight, gliding generally requires the application of an [[airfoil]], such as the [[wing]]s on aircraft or birds, or the [[Patagium|gliding membrane]] of a [[gliding possum]]. However, gliding can be achieved with a flat ([[Camber (aerodynamics)|uncambered]]) wing, as with a simple [[paper plane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Ken|title=Paper Plane Aerodynamics|url=http://paperplane.org/paero.htm|publisher=Ken Blackburn's Paper Airplanes|accessdate=8 October 2012|quote=Section 4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even with [[card-throwing]]. However, some aircraft with [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] and animals such as the [[flying snake]] can achieve gliding flight without any wings by creating a flattened surface underneath.

==Aircraft ("gliders")==
{{main|Glider aircraft}}
Most winged aircraft can glide to some extent, but there are several types of aircraft designed to glide:
* [[Glider (sailplane)|Glider]], also known as a sailplane
* [[Hang glider]]
* [[Paraglider]]
* [[Speed glider]]
* [[Ram-air parachute]]
* [[Rotor kite]], if untethered, known as a rotary glider, or gyroglider.
* [[Military glider]]
* [[Paper aeroplane]]
* [[Radio-controlled glider]]
* [[Rocket glider]]
* [[Wingsuit]]

The main human application is currently recreational, though during the [[Second World War]] [[military glider]]s were used for carrying troops and equipment into battle. The types of aircraft that are used for sport and recreation are classified as [[glider (sailplane)|gliders (sailplanes)]], [[hang glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s. These two latter types are often foot-launched. The design of all three types enables them to repeatedly climb using rising air and then to glide before finding the next source of lift.  When done in gliders (sailplanes), the sport is known as [[gliding]] and sometimes as soaring. For foot-launched aircraft, it is known as [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]]. [[Radio-controlled glider]]s with fixed wings are also soared by enthusiasts.

In addition to [[motor glider]]s, some powered aircraft are designed for routine glides during part of their flight; usually when landing after a period of a powered flight. These include:
* [[Experimental aircraft]] such as the [[North American X-15]], which glided back having used their fuel
* [[Spacecraft]] such as the [[Space Shuttle]]s, [[SpaceShipOne]] and the Russian [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]]

Some aircraft are not designed to glide except in an emergency, such as engine failure. See [[List of airline flights that required gliding|list of airline flights that required gliding flight]]. Gliding in a helicopter is called [[autorotation]].

==Gliding animals==
{{further|Flying and gliding animals|List of soaring birds}}

===Birds===
A number of [[animal]]s have [[Convergent evolution|separately evolved]] gliding many times, without any single ancestor. Birds in particular use gliding flight to minimise their use of energy. Large birds are notably adept at gliding, including:
* [[Albatross]]
* [[Condor]]
* [[Vulture]]
* [[Eagle]]
* [[Stork]]
* [[Frigatebird]]

Like recreational aircraft, birds can alternate periods of gliding with periods of soaring in [[lift (soaring)|rising air]], and so spend a considerable time airborne with a minimal expenditure of energy. The [[great frigatebird]] in particular is capable of continuous flights up to several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/30/484164544/non-stop-flight-how-the-frigatebird-can-soar-for-months-without-stopping|title=Nonstop Flight: How The Frigatebird Can Soar For Weeks Without Stopping|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
[[File:Patagium-flying squirrel-psf.png|thumb|Patagium on a flying squirrel]]
To assist gliding, some mammals have evolved a structure called the [[patagium]]. This is a membranous structure found stretched between a range of body parts. It is most highly developed in bats. For similar reasons to birds, [[bat]]s can glide efficiently. In bats, the [[skin]] forming the surface of the wing is an extension of the skin of the abdomen that runs to the tip of each digit, uniting the forelimb with the body.  The patagium of a bat has four distinct parts:
# Propatagium: the patagium present from the neck to the first digit
# Dactylopatagium: the portion found within the digits
# Plagiopatagium: the portion found between the last digit and the hindlimbs
# [[Interfemoral membrane|Uropatagium]]: the posterior portion of the body between the two hindlimbs

Other mammals such as [[gliding possum]]s and [[flying squirrel]]s also glide using a patagium, but with much poorer efficiency than bats. They cannot gain height. The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its limbs to expose the gliding membranes, usually to get from tree to tree in [[rainforest]]s as an efficient means of both locating food and evading predators. This form of [[arboreal locomotion]], is common in tropical regions such as [[Borneo]] and Australia, where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced.

In flying squirrels, the patagium stretches from the fore- to the hind-limbs along the length of each side of the torso.  In the [[sugar glider]], the patagia extend between the fifth finger of each hand to the first toe of each foot.  This creates an [[aerofoil]] enabling them to glide 50 metres or more.&lt;ref name="Strahan-1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strahan|first=the Australian Museum|editor=Ronald|title=Complete Book of Australian Mammals: The National Photographic Index of Australian Wildlife|year=1983|publisher=[[Angus &amp; Robertson]]|location=Sydney|isbn=0207144540|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gliding flight is regulated by changing the curvature of the membrane or moving the legs and tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=799 |title=Sugar Glider Fun Facts |publisher=Drsfostersmith.com |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish, reptiles, amphibians and other gliding animals===
In addition to mammals and birds, other animals notably [[flying fish]], [[flying snake]]s, [[flying frog]]s and [[flying squid]] also glide.

[[File:Pink-wing flying fish.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Flying fish taking off]]
The flights of flying fish are typically around 50&amp;nbsp;meters (160&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"&gt;[[Ross Piper]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/flying-fish/ Flying Fish, ''Exocoetidae''] ''National Geographic''.

Gliding flight has evolved independently among 3,400 species of frogs&lt;ref name="numerous"&gt;Emerson, S.B., &amp; Koehl, M.A.R. (1990). "The interaction of behavioral and morphological change in the evolution of a novel locomotor type: 'Flying' frogs."

Characteristics of the [[Old World]] species include "enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs

==Forces==
[[File:GliderForces.gif|thumb|right|Forces on a gliding animal or aircraft in flight]]
Three principal forces act on aircraft and animals when gliding:&lt;ref name=nasaforces&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/glider.html NASA: Three forces on a glider or gliding animal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* weight – gravity acts in the downwards direction
* lift – acts perpendicularly to the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] representing airspeed
* drag – acts parallel to the vector representing the airspeed

As the aircraft or animal descends, the air moving over the wings generates [[lift force|lift]]. The lift force acts slightly forward of vertical because it is created at right angles to the airflow which comes from slightly below as the glider descends, see [[angle of attack]]. This horizontal component of lift is enough to overcome [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and allows the glider to accelerate forward. Even though the weight causes the aircraft to descend, if the air is rising faster than the sink rate, there will be a gain of altitude.

==Lift to drag ratio==
{{main|Lift to drag ratio}}
[[File:Polar Curve 2.png|thumb|Polar curve showing glide angle for best glide]]
The lift-to-drag ratio, or ''L/D ratio'', is the amount of [[Lift (force)|lift]] generated by a [[wing]] or vehicle, divided by the [[drag (physics)|drag]] it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favourable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's needed lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better fuel economy and climb performance.

The effect of [[airspeed]] on the rate of descent can be depicted by a [[polar curve (aviation)|polar curve]]. These curves show the airspeed where minimum sink can be achieved and the airspeed with the best L/D ratio. The curve is an inverted U-shape. As speeds reduce the amount of lift falls rapidly around the stalling speed. The peak of the 'U' is at minimum drag.

As lift and drag are both proportional to the coefficient of Lift and Drag respectively multiplied by the same factor (1/2 ρ&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S), the L/D ratio can be simplified to  the Coefficient of lift divided by the coefficient of drag or Cl/Cd, and since both are proportional to the airspeed, the ratio of L/D or Cl/Cd is then typically plotted against angle of attack.

==Drag==

[[Induced drag]] is caused by the generation of lift by the wing. Lift generated by a wing is perpendicular to the relative wind, but since wings typically fly at some small [[angle of attack]], this means that a component of the force is directed to the rear. The rearward component of this force (parallel with the relative wind) is seen as drag. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the drag graph, the left side of the U.

[[Profile drag]] is caused by air hitting the wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This form of drag, also known as [[wind resistance]], varies with the square of speed (see [[drag equation]]). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the drag graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by reducing cross section and streamlining.

[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|right|The drag curve]]
As lift increases steadily until the critical angle, it is normally the point where the combined drag is at its lowest, that the wing or aircraft is performing at its best L/D.

Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen [[cruising speed]] for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in [[aeronautical engineering]], the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high [[angle of attack]] and a gentle [[Stall (flight)|stall]] are also important.

Minimising drag is of particular interest in the design and operation of high performance [[glider (sailplane)]]s, the largest of which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1, though many others have a lower performance; 25:1 being considered adequate for training use.

==Glide ratio==
When flown at a constant speed in still air a glider moves forwards a certain distance for a certain distance downwards. The ratio of the distance forwards to downwards is called the ''glide ratio''. The glide ratio (E) is numerically equal to the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] under these conditions; but is not necessarily equal during other manoeuvres, especially if speed is not constant. A glider's glide ratio varies with airspeed, but there is a maximum value which is frequently quoted. Glide ratio usually varies little with vehicle loading; a heavier vehicle glides faster, but nearly maintains its glide ratio.&lt;ref&gt;''Glider Flying Handbook'', FAA Publication 8083-13, Page 3-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glide ratio.gif|300px|right]]
Glide ratio (or "finesse") is the [[cotangent]] of the downward angle, the ''glide angle'' (γ).  Alternatively it is also the forward speed divided by sink speed (unpowered aircraft):

:&lt;math&gt;{L \over D}={{\Delta s} \over {\Delta h}}={v_{\text{forward}} \over v_{\text{down}}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Glide number'' (ε) is the reciprocal of glide ratio but sometime it's confused.

==Examples==

{{Glide ratio examples}}

==Importance of the glide ratio in gliding flight==

Although the best glide ratio is important when measuring the performance of a gliding aircraft, its glide ratio at a range of speeds also determines its success (see article on [[gliding]]).

Pilots sometimes fly at the aircraft's best L/D by precisely controlling airspeed and smoothly operating the controls to reduce drag. However the strength of the likely next lift, minimising the time spent in strongly sinking air and the strength of the wind also affects the optimal [[speed to fly]]. Pilots fly faster to get quickly through sinking air, and when heading into wind to optimise the glide angle relative to the ground. To achieve higher speed across country, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders (sailplanes)]] are often loaded with water [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] to increase the airspeed and so reach the next area of lift sooner. This has little effect on the glide angle since the increases in the rate of sink and in the airspeed remain in proportion and thus the heavier aircraft achieves optimal L/D at a higher airspeed. If the areas of lift are strong on the day, the benefits of ballast outweigh the slower rate of climb.

If the air is rising faster than the rate of sink, the aircraft will climb. At lower speeds an aircraft may have a worse glide ratio but it will also have a lower rate of sink. A low airspeed also improves its ability to turn tightly in centre of the [[lift (soaring)|rising air]] where the rate of ascent is greatest. A sink rate of approximately 1.0&amp;nbsp;m/s is the most that a practical hang glider or paraglider could have before it would limit the occasions that a climb was possible to only when there was strongly rising air. Gliders (sailplanes) have minimum sink rates of between 0.4 and 0.6&amp;nbsp;m/s depending on the [[Glider Competition Classes|class]]. Aircraft such as airliners may have a better glide ratio than a hang glider, but would rarely be able to thermal because of their much higher forward speed and their much higher sink rate. (Note that the [[Boeing 767]] in the [[Gimli Glider]] incident achieved a glide ratio of only 12:1.)

The loss of height can be measured at several speeds and plotted on a "[[polar curve (aviation)|polar curve]]" to calculate the best speed to fly in various conditions, such as when flying into wind or when in sinking air.   Other polar curves can be measured after loading the glider with water ballast.  As mass increases, the best glide ratio is achieved at higher speeds. (The glide ratio is not increased.)

==Soaring==
{{main|Lift (soaring)}}
Soaring animals and aircraft may alternate glides with periods of soaring in [[lift (soaring)|rising air]]. Five principal types of lift are used:&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book | last = Welch | first = John | title = Van Sickle's Modern Airmanship | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | location = City | year = 1999 | pages = 856–858 | isbn = 0-07-069633-0 | quote = There are four main kinds of lift which the soaring pilot may use....}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thermal]]s, [[ridge lift]], [[lee waves]], [[Convergence zone|convergences]] and [[dynamic soaring]]. Dynamic soaring is used predominately by birds, and some model aircraft, though it has also been achieved on rare occasions by piloted aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last= Reichmann |first= Helmut |title= Streckensegelflug |publisher= Motorbuch Verlag |year= 2005 |isbn = 3-613-02479-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of soaring flight by birds are the use of:
* Thermals and convergences by [[bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[vulture]]s
* Ridge lift by [[gull]]s near cliffs
* Wave lift by migrating birds&lt;ref&gt;[Report of use of wave lift by birds by Netherlands Institute for Ecology]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic effects near the surface of the sea by [[albatross]]es

For humans, soaring is the basis for three [[air sports]]: [[gliding]], [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]].

A '''guilty pleasure''' is something, such as a film, a television program or a piece of music, that one enjoys despite understanding that it is not generally held in high regard, or is seen as unusual or weird. For example, a person may secretly like a movie but will admit that particular movie is poorly made and/or generally seen as "not good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/loves-evolver/201005/why-its-good-feel-guilty|title=Why It's Good to Feel Guilty|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=May 14, 2010|first=Maryanne|last=Fisher|work=[[Psychology Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/against-guilty-pleasure|title=Against "Guilty Pleasure"|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Szalai|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fashion]], [[video game]]s, [[music]], [[theatre]], [[television series]], [[Movie|films]], [[food]] and [[fetishes]] can be examples of guilty pleasures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26742">The '''hostile media effect''', originally deemed the '''hostile media phenomenon''' and sometimes called '''hostile media perception''', is a perceptual theory of [[mass communication]] that refers to the tendency for individuals with a strong preexisting attitude on an issue to perceive [[media coverage]] as [[media bias|biased]] against their side and in favor of their antagonists' point of view.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Perloff, R. M. (2015). A Three-Decade Retrospective on the Hostile Media Effect. ''Mass Communication and Society'', ''18''(6), 701-729. {{doi|10.1080/15205436.2015.1051234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partisans from opposite sides of an issue will tend to find the same coverage to be biased against them.&lt;ref name="vallone-85"&gt;Vallone, R.P., Ross, L., &amp; Lepper, M.R. (1985). [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jpiliavi/965/hwang.pdf The hostile media phenomenon: Biased Perception and Perceptions of Media Bias in Coverage of the "Beirut Massacre".] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''49''', 577-585. [http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/vallone_beirut.html summary]. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first proposed and studied experimentally by [[Robert Vallone]], [[Lee Ross]] and [[Mark Lepper]].&lt;ref name="vallone-85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vallone-81"&gt;Vallone, R.E., Lepper, M.R., &amp; Ross, L. (1981). Perceptions of media bias in the 1980 presidential election. Unpublished manuscript, Stanford University. As cited in Vallone, Ross &amp; Lepper, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
In 1982, the second major study of this phenomenon was undertaken;&lt;ref name="vallone-85"/&gt; pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] students and pro-[[Israel]]i students at [[Stanford University]] were shown the same news filmstrips pertaining to the then-recent [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] of Palestinian [[refugee]]s by Christian Lebanese militia fighters abetted by the Israeli army in [[Beirut]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. On a number of objective measures, both sides found that these identical news clips were slanted in favor of the other side. Pro-Israeli students reported seeing more anti-Israel references and fewer favorable references to Israel in the news report and pro-Palestinian students reported seeing more anti-Palestinian references, and so on. Both sides said a neutral observer would have a more negative view of their side from viewing the clips, and that the media would have excused the other side where it blamed their side.

Subsequent studies have found hostile media effects related to other political conflicts, such as strife in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref name="matheson-durson"&gt;Matheson, K. &amp; Dursun, S. (2001). Social identity precursors to the hostile media phenomenon: Partisan perceptions of coverage of the Bosnian conflict. ''Group Processes and Intergroup Relations'', '''4''', 117-126. {{doi|10.1177/1368430201004002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[U.S. presidential election]]s,&lt;ref name="dalton-beck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=R.

The effect was originally dubbed "hostile media phenomenon" by Vallone et al.,&lt;ref name="vallone-85" /&gt; and is occasionally referred to as "hostile media perception," since it seems to precipitate the effects of media. In a 2015 meta-analysis of the subject,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Perloff said "hostile media effect" is the most often used term:&lt;blockquote&gt;The most common term is "hostile media effect," perhaps because scholars appreciate that the "effect" term cuts to the heart of the mass communication research enterprise and captures the theoretically intriguing aspect of the hostile media phenomenon. (703)&lt;/blockquote&gt; The effect appears to be something of a [[disconfirmation bias]], or "a contrast bias – a deviation of judgment in which a partisan individual perceives or evaluates media content to be further away, in terms of valence, from his or her own point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, A. C., Edgerly, S., Akin, H., &amp; Broesch, J. A. (2012). Partisan evaluation of partisan information. Communication Research, 39, 439–457. {{doi|10.1177/0093650212441794}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the intention of the reporter or the story is irrelevant — those "partisans"&lt;ref name="vallone-85" /&gt; who consume the content find the content that is hostile to their point of view on their own.

An oft-cited forerunner to Vallone et al.'s study was conducted by Albert Hastorf and [[Hadley Cantril]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="hastorf-cantril"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hastorf |first=A. H. |last2=Cantril |first2=H. |year=1954 |title=They Saw a Game: A Case Study |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=129–134 |doi=10.1037/h0057880|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] students were shown a filmstrip of a controversial Princeton-Dartmouth [[American football|football game]]. Asked to count the number of infractions committed by both sides, students at both universities "saw" many more infractions committed by the opposing side, in addition to making different generalizations about the game. Hastorf and Cantril concluded that "there is no such 'thing' as a 'game' existing 'out there' in its own right which people merely 'observe.' ... For the 'thing' simply is ''not'' the same for different people whether the 'thing' is a football game, a presidential candidate, Communism, or spinach."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hastorf|Cantril|1954|pp=132-133}}. Emphasis as in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

=== Cognitive ===
Three [[Cognition|cognitive mechanisms]] for explaining the hostile media effect have been suggested:&lt;ref name=Giner-Sorolla-1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giner-Sorolla|first=R.|author2=Chaiken, S.|title=The causes of hostile media judgments|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=30|issue=2|pages=165–180|doi=10.1006/jesp.1994.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Selective recall''' refers to memory and [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. In instances of the hostile media effect, partisans should tend to remember more of the disconfirming portions of a message than the parts that support their position, in a variation of the [[negativity effect]]. Vallone and his colleagues observed selective recall differing along partisan lines even on simple, objective criteria such as the number of references to a given subject.&lt;ref name="vallone-85" /&gt; However, numerous studies have documented the hostile media effect even when selective recall is positive rather than negative.&lt;ref name="Gunther-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arpan-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giner-Sorolla-1994" /&gt;
* '''[[Selective perception]]''' refers to the process by which individuals perceive what they want to in media messages while ignoring opposing viewpoints. In instances of the hostile media effect, partisans have a heightened tendency to interpret aspects of a message as unfavorable – or hostile – as opposed to categorizations by non-partisans. In other words, selective perception is a form of bias because we interpret information in a way that is congruent with our existing values and beliefs.&lt;ref name="vallone-85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunther-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giner-Sorolla-1994" /&gt;
* The '''different standards''' explanation or '''motivated reasoning''' refers to the validity of arguments. This is [[confirmation bias]] taken to the next level. It leads people to confirm what they already believe, while ignoring contrary data. But it also drives people to develop elaborate rationalizations to justify holding beliefs that logic and evidence have shown to be wrong. Motivated reasoning responds defensively to contrary evidence, actively discrediting such evidence or its source without logical or evidentiary justification. It seems to be assumed by social scientists that motivated reasoning is driven by a desire to avoid [[cognitive dissonance]]. It suggests that reason partisans are so prone to see an unbiased message in a hostile light is because of the strength of the favorable argument they have built in their minds over time. Rather than seeing confirmation bias as an opposite force of hostile media effect, the different standards explanation sees it as a contributing force. As Vallone et al. noted in the seminal study:
::"Partisans who have consistently processed facts and arguments in light of their preconceptions and prejudices […] are bound to believe that the preponderance of reliable, pertinent evidence favors their viewpoint. Accordingly, to the extent that the small sample of evidence and argument featured in a media presentation seems unrepresentative of this larger "population" of information, perceivers will charge bias in the presentation and will be likely to infer hostility and bias on the part of those responsible for it."&lt;ref&gt;Vallone et al., 1985, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that these criteria allow for specific measures beyond subjective generalizations about the media coverage as a whole, such as what might be expressed as "I thought that the news has been generally biased against this side of the issue." The research suggests the hostile media effect is not just a difference of ''opinion'' but a difference of ''perception'' ([[selective perception]]).

=== Source factors ===
Characteristics of the message source may also influence the hostile media effect. A source perceived to be friendly to the partisan (usually because of agreeable ideology or geographic proximity to the group) is less likely to invoke the hostile media effect than a source that is disagreeable or geographically detached.&lt;ref name="Arpan-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reid-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reid|first=S.A.|title=A self-categorization explanation for the hostile media effect|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2012|volume=62|issue=3|pages=381–399|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous studies, Albert C. Gunther and his associates have suggested that the ability of mass media to reach a large audience is what triggers the hostile media effect. Consistently, they found that a message appearing to originate from a newspaper was perceived as hostile by partisans, while an identical message appearing in a student essay was perceived as unbiased, or even favorable toward the partisan cause.&lt;ref name="Gunther-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunther-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunther-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Miller, N. |author3=Liebhart, J.L. |title=Assimilation and contrast in a test of the hostile media effect|journal=Communication Research|year=2009|volume=36|issue=6|pages=747–764|doi=10.1177/0093650209346804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon also exists for personalities on television – partisans in a study were found to perceive significantly less bias in a host they perceive as like-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, L. (2011). Partisan differences in opinionated news perceptions: A test of the hostile media effect. ''Political Behavior'', ''33''(3), 407-432. {{doi|10.1007/s11109-010-9139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Consistent with a hostile media effect, issue partisans perceived less bias in opinionated news hosts whose viewpoints cohered with their own than did non-partisans and especially partisans on the opposing side of the issue. In most cases, these partisan differences were as big as—if not bigger than—the differences seen in response to non-opinionated news, indicating that even blatant deviations from journalistic norms do not quell partisan selectivity in news perceptions, at least when it comes to perceived bias in the host of opinionated programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt; While partisans can agree on the bias of a particular source, the reasons for that bias appears to account for the difference; that is, consumers on both sides of an issue may see bias in a particular story, but are more likely to attribute that story to a host they perceive as hostile to their own particular cause.

=== Partisanship ===
All of these explanatory mechanisms are influenced by partisanship. From the first studies, the hostile media effect has required an audience of partisans, with stronger beliefs correlating with stronger manifestations of the effect.&lt;ref name="Arpan-2003"/&gt; Increasing devotion to a particular side of an issue leads to increasing levels of biased information processing, whether out of protection of personal values&lt;ref name="Gunther-2009"/&gt; or a strong sense of group affiliation.&lt;ref name="Reid-2012"/&gt;

==Relative hostile media effect==
Early hostile media effect studies measured perceptions of a media message designed to be unbiased. As ideologically diversified news outlets became more commonplace, later experiments began to utilize messages that were less objective. They found that while partisans on both sides of an issue recognized the bias, the group the message opposed perceived a greater degree of bias than the group the message supported. This variation is referred to as the relative hostile media effect, and has been demonstrated in media coverage of the use of primates for lab testing.&lt;ref name=Gunther-2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Chia, S.C.|title=Predicting pluralistic ignorance: The hostile media perception and its consequences|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2001|volume=78|issue=4|pages=688–701|doi=10.1177/107769900107800405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther et al.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, A. C., Christen, C. T., Liebhart, J. L., &amp; Chia, S. C.-Y. (2001). Congenial public, contrary press, and biased estimates of the climate of opinion. ''Public Opinion Quarterly, 65'', 295–320. {{doi|10.1086/322846}}&lt;/ref&gt; said, "the relative hostile media effect occurs when individuals with different attitudes toward the issue exhibit significantly different evaluations of the same media content.”

In fact, as Glass et al. noted in a 2000 study,&lt;ref&gt;Glass, J. E., Peffley, M., &amp; Avery, J. M. (2000). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160514163051/http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/MediaBiasMWPSA%284-18-00%29.pdf Perceiving Bias in the News: The Hostile Media Phenomenon Revisited]. ''Midwest Political Science Association. Chicago, Illinois'', ''18''.&lt;/ref&gt; "partisans tend to see objectively biased articles as 'even-handed' if the bias impugns the opposition group." The study measured the responses of pro-choice and pro-life voters, finding that "people with more extreme views on abortion sometimes evaluate biased news articles as being fair, but only when the opposing side is being gored."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Coe, K., Tewksbury, D., Bond, B. J., Drogos, K. L., Porter, R. W., Yahn, A., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2008). Hostile news: Partisan use and perceptions of cable news programming. ''Journal of Communication, 58'', 201–219. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect appears to exist more among conservatives than liberals, according to multiple studies. When randomly assigned either a clip from Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (liberal), or a similar program from Fox News (conservative), conservatives perceived significantly more bias in the program than liberal subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is entirely possible that the "relative hostile media effect," in this case, is a function of preconceived biases related to the program itself, rather than the content. In a 1998 study, Dalton et al., found that newspaper readers were best able to detect the partisan stands of their newspapers when the newspaper sent a clear and unambiguous political signal; otherwise, individual partisanship predominated in judgments. Unsurprisingly, studies related to media content that is strictly opinionated – that is, media content that is not intended to be unbiased – have shown that partisans are quite capable of identifying bias in those conditions.

== Media literacy ==
Studies have been conducted to determine whether [[media literacy]] – competency in analyzing and evaluating messages from mass media – might affect a media consumer's HME, thus far to limited results. In a 2014 study,&lt;ref&gt;Vraga, E. K., &amp; Tully, M. (2015). Media Literacy Messages and Hostile Media Perceptions: Processing of Nonpartisan Versus Partisan Political Information. ''Mass Communication and Society'', ''18''(4), 422-448. {{doi|10.1080/15205436.2014.1001910}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants watched a Media Literacy PSA prior to watching manipulated television programs, then asked to rate their perceptions of the relative hostility of the media afterwards. The effects were strong in some areas but less so in others. "Given that the digital media environment allows individuals to select their own media content – and people tend to choose what they find more credible – in some cases a news media literacy message may spur further selection into agreeable political enclaves, now seen as even more credible, and contribute to rising political polarization" (26).

== Moderators ==

=== Reach ===
Gunther and Schmitt&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, A. C., &amp; Schmitt, K. (2004). Mapping boundaries of the hostile media effect. ''Journal of Communication, 54'', 55–70. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2004.tb02613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to discern why in some cases research subjects faulted ambiguous, contradictory information, and supported it in other cases. One conclusion they suggested was the reach of the publication — that is, the hostile media effect is likely to emerge when participants are estimating the effects on others of mass media with a large reach, but biased assimilation would occur when the participants are judging media with lower reach (in this case, a research report that presumably reaches only people in a particular field).

=== Involvement ===
Hansen and Kim&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, G. J., &amp; Kim, H. (2011). Is the media biased against me? A meta-analysis of the hostile media effect research. ''Communication Research Reports, 28'', 169–179. {{doi|10.1080/08824096.2011.565280}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that involvement is positively correlated with hostile media effect; that is, the effect increases as individuals become more involved with the issue. The study also found a significant effect that emerged with those who have low involvement. Other studies have found high correlations of the effect in ''value-relevant involvement''&lt;ref&gt;Choi, J., Yang, M., &amp; Chang, J. J. C. (2009). Elaboration of the hostile media phenomenon: The roles of involvement, media skepticism, congruency of perceived media influence, and perceived opinion climate. ''Communication Research, 36'', 54–75. {{doi|10.1177/0093650208326462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''affective involvement''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthes, J. (2013). The affective underpinnings of hostile media perceptions: Exploring the distinct effects of affective and cognitive involvement. ''Communication Research, 40'', 360–387. {{doi|10.1177/0093650211420255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social identity ===
[[Social identity theory]] suggests that media coverage of an ego-involving issue will activate group identity and increase the salience of the issue among members of a group that champions a particular political or social cause. This in turn triggers self-categorization processes, as [[ingroup]] members differentiate themselves from their counterparts in the outgroup, seeking to elevate their self-esteem by viewing the ingroup as superior to the disliked outgroup on core dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, T., &amp; Tanis, M. (2013). Examining the hostile media effect as an intergroup phenomenon: The role of ingroup identification and status. ''Journal of Communication, 63'', 535–555. {{doi|10.1111/jcom.12031}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exposed to controversial media coverage that contains unfavorable depictions of the ingroup, group members, concerned about the perceived inaccuracy of the portrayals and convinced that the portrayals undermine the group’s legitimacy in the larger society, cope by derogating media coverage, viewing it as hostilely biased. In this way, they reduce the symbolic threat and restore valued social self-esteem.

A related potential moderator is the outgroup membership of the message source. Reid&lt;ref&gt;Reid, S. A. (2012). "A self-categorization explanation for the hostile media effect". ''Journal of Communication, 62'', 381–399. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that  more politically extreme Democratic students  perceived less bias when a polemical assault on their group was attributed to a Democratic (ingroup) organization, but detected more bias when the attack was ascribed to a pro-Republican outgroup.

== Mediators ==
Perloff&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; identified four factors as the reasons those individuals with strong attitudes towards a particular issue, as well as high involvement, might perceive hostile media bias: ''selective recall'', which causes partisans to focus more on contradictory information; ''selective categorization'', in which partisans categorize more content as unfair to their position than fair; ''different standards'', in which partisans classify more of the content that reflects positively on their position as accurate, and information that reflects negatively as inaccurate; and ''prior beliefs about [[media bias]]'', in which partisans judge media content unfairly based on a generalized negative set of beliefs about the media in general.

== Hostile media online ==
Research around HME in the [[digital age]] is still in relative infancy. Partisan users of [[online media]] have abilities to interact with the mass media in a way they have never before. Some may attribute the effects of hostile media in the future to issue-specific [[social media]] messages, for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Relative effects may be higher, however, in the digital media future:&lt;blockquote&gt;Partisans on both sides could easily agree that a series of posts is biased in one ideological direction, but those whose political ox is being gored should be more likely to presume bias and hostile intent. More generally, anecdotal evidence suggests that individuals perceive that social media messages have strong effects, frequently perceiving that negative communications will have deleterious influences on online third persons. (722)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== Persuasive press inference ===
Gunther and Chia&lt;ref name="Gunther-2001" /&gt; invoked the concept of persuasive press inference in a 2001 study, in which individuals form impressions of the direction or slant of news coverage, extrapolate that news in general resembles the news stories they personally viewed, assume that high-reach news influences the public, and therefore presume that public opinion corresponds with the perceived directionality of news. Therefore, those partisans who begin with the belief in a hostile media will conclude that public opinion is opposed to their particular cause. Research for this particular hypothesis has thus far met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;Huge, M., &amp; Glynn, C. J. (2010). Hostile media and the campaign trail: Perceived media bias in the race for governor. ''Journal of Communication, 60'', 165–181. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the hostile media effect translates into real-world effects is unclear.

{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}

In mathematics, an '''image''' is the [[subset]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]'s [[codomain]] which is the output of the function from a subset of its [[Domain of a function|domain]].

Evaluating a function at each element of a subset ''X'' of the domain, produces a set called the ''image of X under or through'' the function. The '''inverse image''' or '''preimage''' of a particular subset ''S'' of the [[codomain]] of a function is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of ''S''.

Image and inverse image may also be defined for general [[binary relation#Operations on binary relations|binary relations]], not just functions.

==Definition==
The word "image" is used in three related ways. In these definitions, ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to the set ''Y''.

===Image of an element===
If ''x'' is a member of ''X'', then ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' (the [[value (mathematics)|value]] of ''f'' when applied to ''x'') is the image of ''x'' under ''f''. ''y'' is alternatively known as the output of ''f'' for argument ''x''.

===Image of a subset===
The image of a subset ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' under ''f'' is the subset ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ⊆ ''Y'' defined by (in [[set-builder notation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;f[A] = \{ \, y \in Y \, | \, y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in A \, \}&lt;/math&gt;

When there is no risk of confusion, ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is  simply written as ''f''(''A''). This convention is a common one; the intended meaning must be inferred from the context.  This makes ''f''[.] a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[power set]] of ''X'' (the set of all [[subset]]s of ''X''), and whose [[codomain]] is the power set of ''Y''. See [[#Notation|Notation]] below.

===Image of a function===
The image ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the entire [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' is called simply the image of ''f''.

===Generalization to binary relations===
If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[binary relation]] on ''X''[[cartesian product|×]]''Y'', the set { y∈''Y'' | ''xRy'' for some ''x''∈''X'' } is called the image, or the range, of ''R''. Dually, the set { ''x''∈''X'' | ''xRy'' for some y∈''Y'' } is called the domain of ''R''.

==Inverse image==
{{Redirect|Preimage|the cryptographic attack on hash functions|preimage attack}}
Let ''f'' be a function from ''X'' to ''Y''.  The '''preimage''' or inverse image of a set ''B'' ⊆ ''Y'' under ''f'' is the subset of ''X'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[ B ] = \{ \, x \in X \, | \, f(x) \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse image of a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], denoted by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{''y''}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or by   ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is also called the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over ''y'' or the [[level set]] of ''y''.  The set of all the fibers over the elements of ''Y'' is a family of sets indexed by ''Y''.

For example, for the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the inverse image of {4} would be {−2, 2}. Again, if there is no risk of confusion, we may denote ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''B''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''), and think of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as a function from the power set of ''Y'' to the power set of ''X''. The notation ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; should not be confused with that for [[inverse function]]. The notation coincides with the usual one, though, for bijections, in the sense that the inverse image of ''B'' under ''f'' is the image of ''B'' under ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==&lt;span id="Notation"&gt;Notation&lt;/span&gt; for image and inverse image==
The traditional notations used in the previous section can be confusing. An alternative&lt;ref&gt;Blyth 2005, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; is to give explicit names for the image and preimage as functions between powersets:

===Arrow notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow(A) = \{ f(a)\;|\; a \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow(B) = \{ a \in X \;|\; f(a) \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Star notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f_\star:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\star:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;

===Other terminology===
* An alternative notation for ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; used in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] is ''f''&amp;nbsp;"''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Set Theory for the Mathematician | author=Jean E. Rubin |authorlink= Jean E. Rubin |page=xix | year=1967 |publisher=Holden-Day |asin=B0006BQH7S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Randall Holmes: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8d8/5cdd3eb2fd9406d13b5c04d55708068031ef.pdf Inhomogeneity of the urelements in the usual models of NFU], December 29, 2005, on: Semantic Scholar, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some texts refer to the image of ''f'' as the range of ''f'', but this usage should be avoided because the word "range" is also commonly used to mean the [[codomain]] of ''f''.

==Examples==
# ''f'': {1, 2, 3} → {''a, b, c, d''} defined by &lt;math&gt;
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=1 \\
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=2 \\
      c, &amp; \mbox{if }x=3.
    \end{matrix}\right.
  &lt;/math&gt;{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of the set {2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({2, 3}) = {''a, c''}.  The ''image'' of the function ''f'' is {''a, c''}. The ''preimage'' of ''a'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) = {1, 2}. The ''preimage'' of {''a, b''} is also {1, 2}.  The preimage of {''b'', ''d''} is the [[empty set]] {}.
# ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of {−2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({−2, 3}) = {4, 9}, and the ''image'' of ''f'' is '''R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The ''preimage'' of {4, 9} under ''f'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({4, 9}) = {−3, −2, 2, 3}. The preimage of set ''N'' = {''n'' ∈ '''R''' | ''n'' &lt; 0} under ''f'' is the empty set, because the negative numbers do not have square roots in the set of reals.
# ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The [[Fiber (mathematics)|''fibres'']] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) are [[concentric circles]] about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], the origin itself, and the [[empty set]], depending on whether ''a'' &gt; 0, ''a'' = 0, or ''a'' &lt; 0, respectively.
# If ''M'' is a [[manifold]] and ''π'': ''TM'' → ''M'' is the canonical [[projection (mathematics)|projection]] from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' to ''M'', then the ''fibres'' of ''π'' are the [[tangent spaces]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') for ''x''∈''M''. This is also an example of a [[fiber bundle]].
# A quotient group is a homomorphic image.

==Consequences==

Given a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', for all subsets ''A'', ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' and all subsets ''B'', ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' we have:
* ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;= ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="kelley-1985"&gt;Kelley (1985), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=-goleb9Ov3oC|page=85|text=The image of the union of a family of subsets of X is the union of the images, but, in general, the image of the intersection is not the intersection of the images}} p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;⊆ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="kelley-1985"/&gt;

* ''f''(A)&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B'' ⇔  ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;    ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')
* ''f''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;ref&gt;Equality holds if ''B'' is a subset of Im(''f'') or, in particular, if ''f'' is surjective. See Munkres, J.. Topology (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''A''))&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;ref&gt;Equality holds if  ''f'' is injective. See Munkres, J.. Topology (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊆ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊆ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;
* (''f''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') = ''A'' ∩ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'').

The results relating images and preimages to the ([[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]]) algebra of [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] work for any collection of subsets, not just for pairs of subsets:
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}A_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}A_s\right) \subseteq \bigcap_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcap_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, ''S'' can be infinite, even [[uncountably infinite]].)

With respect to the algebra of subsets, by the above we see that the inverse image function is a [[lattice homomorphism]] while the image function is only a [[semilattice]] homomorphism (it does not always preserve intersections).

==Phylogeny and evolution==
The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[Crotalinae|pitviper]]s and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]]. It evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[loreal pit]]s), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales (labial pits). Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. 
	
In [[viperidae|vipers]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily [[Crotalinae]]: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively by them to detect and target [[warm-blooded]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. In an experiment that tested snakes' abilities to locate a cool thermal refuge in an uncomfortably hot maze, all pitvipers were able to locate the refuge quickly and easily, while [[Viperinae|true vipers]] were unable to do so. This suggests that the pitvipers were using their pit organs to aid in thermoregulatory decisions.&lt;ref name="KBLaD"/&gt; It is also possible that the organ may even have evolved as a defensive adaptation rather than a predatory one, or that multiple pressures may have potentially contributed to the organ's development.&lt;ref name="Gre92"/&gt; The use of the heat pit to direct thermoregulation in pythons and boas has not yet been determined. [[Viperinae|Viperinae]] snakes (which lack pit organs) also use thermal cues to guide strike behavior, but not to guide thermoregulation.&lt;ref name="KBLaD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bre90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breidenbach | first1 = CV | year = 1990 | title = Thermal cues influence strikes in pitless vipers | url = | journal = Journal of Herpetology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 448–450 | doi=10.2307/1565074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
In [[Crotalinae|pitvipers]], the heat pit consists of a deep pocket in the rostrum with a [[Biological membrane|membrane]] stretched across it. Behind the membrane, an air-filled chamber provides air contact on either side of the membrane. The pit membrane is highly vascular and heavily innervated with numerous heat-sensitive receptors formed from terminal masses of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (terminal nerve masses, or TNMs). The receptors are therefore not discrete cells, but a part of the trigeminal nerve itself. The labial pit found in [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]] lacks the suspended membrane and consists more simply of a pit lined with a membrane that is similarly innervated and vascular, though the morphology of the [[vasculature]] differs between these snakes and [[Crotalinae|crotalines]]. The purpose of the vasculature, in addition to providing oxygen to the receptor terminals, is to rapidly cool the receptors to their thermo-neutral state after being heated by thermal radiation from a stimulus. Were it not for this vasculature, the receptor would remain in a warm state after being exposed to a warm stimulus, and would present the animal with afterimages even after the stimulus was removed.&lt;ref name="Gor03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goris | first1 = CR | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = The microvasculature of python pit organs: morphology and blood flow kinetics | url = | journal = Microvascular Research | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 179–185 | doi=10.1016/s0026-2862(03)00003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Diagram of the Crotaline Pit Organ.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the Crotaline pit organ.]]

===Neuroanatomy===
In all cases, the facial pit is innervated by the trigeminal nerve. In [[Crotalinae|crotalines]], information from the pit organ is relayed to the nucleus reticularus caloris in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] via the lateral descending trigeminal tract. From there, it is relayed to the contralateral [[optic tectum]]. In [[Boidae|boas]] and [[Pythonidae|pythons]], information from the labial pit is sent directly to the contralateral optic tectum via the lateral descending trigeminal tract, bypassing the nucleus reticularus caloris.&lt;ref name="New80"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = EA | last2 = Gruberd | first2 = ER | last3 = Hartline | first3 = PH | year = 1980 | title = The infrared trigemino-tectal pathway in the rattlesnake and in the python | url = | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1002/cne.901910309 | pmid=7410602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the optic tectum of the brain which eventually processes these infrared cues. This portion of the brain receives other sensory information as well, most notably [[optic]] stimulation, but also motor, [[proprioceptive]] and [[Sound|auditory]]. Some [[neurons]] in the tectum respond to visual or infrared stimulation alone; others respond more strongly to combined visual and infrared stimulation, and still others respond only to a combination of visual and infrared. Some neurons appear to be tuned to detect movement in one direction. It has been found that the snake’s visual and infrared maps of the world are overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.&lt;ref name="Har78"&gt;{{Cite journal

The nerve fibers in the pit organ are constantly firing at a very low rate. Objects that are within a neutral temperature range do not change the rate of firing; the neutral range is determined by the average thermal radiation of all objects in the [[receptive field]] of the organ. The thermal radiation above a given threshold causes an increase in the temperature of the nerve fiber, resulting in stimulation of the nerve and subsequent firing, with increased temperature resulting in increased firing rate.&lt;ref name="Bul52"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bullock | first1 = TH | last2 = Cowles | first2 = RB | year = 1952 | title = Physiology of an infrared receptor: the facial pit of pit vipers | url = | journal = Science | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 541–543 | doi=10.1126/science.115.2994.541-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity of the nerve fibers is estimated to be &gt;0.001&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Bak07"&gt;{{Citation| title = The imaging properties and sensitivity of the facial pits of pitvipers as determined by optical and heat-transfer analysis

The pit organ will adapt to a repeated stimulus; if an adapted stimulus is removed, there will be a fluctuation in the opposite direction. For example, if a warm object is placed in front of the snake, the organ will increase in firing rate at first, but after a while will adapt to the warm object and the firing rate of the nerves in the pit organ will return to normal. If that warm object is then removed, the pit organ will now register the space that it used to occupy as being colder, and as such the firing rate will be depressed until it adapts to the removal of the object. The [[Incubation period|latency period]] of adaptation is approximately 50-150&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Bul52"/&gt;

The facial pit actually visualizes thermal radiation using the same optical principles as a [[pinhole camera]], wherein the location of a source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in poor resolution of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor [[heat conduction]], the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and it is possible that the visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help sharpen the image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal [[background radiation]] (colder areas) to maximize the contrast of their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.&lt;ref name="Bak07"/&gt;

===Molecular mechanism===
In spite of its detection of infrared light, the infrared detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors - while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is a type of [[transient receptor potential channel]], [[TRPA1]] which is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracheva|first=Elena O. |author2=Nicholas T. Ingolia |author3=Yvonne M. Kelly |author4=Julio F. Cordero-Morales |author5=Gunther Hollopeter |author6=Alexander T. Chesler |author7=Elda E. Sánchez |author8=John C. Perez |author9=Jonathan S. Weissman |author10=David Julius|title=Molecular basis of infrared detection by snakes|journal=Nature|date=15 April 2010|volume=464|pages=1006–1011|doi=10.1038/nature08943|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7291/full/nature08943.html|issue=7291|pmid=20228791|pmc=2855400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In structure and function it resembles a biological version of warmth-sensing instrument called a [[bolometer]]. This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which would allow incoming infrared radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as the vascularization of the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original temperature state.  While the molecular precursors of this mechanism are found in other snakes, the protein is both expressed to a much lower degree and is much less sensitive to heat.&lt;ref name="Gracheva09"/&gt;

An '''intuition pump''' is a [[thought experiment]] structured to allow the thinker to use their [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] to develop an answer to a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baggini |first=Julian |author2=Peter Fosl |title=The Philosopher's Toolkit: A Compendium of Philosophical Concepts and Methods |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2003 |pages=51–52 |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0631228748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term was coined by [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|year=1980|title=The milk of human intentionality|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/milk-of-human-intentionality/5F6F054DCB3738ACDB5DB8611FAFD243|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0000580x|issn=1469-1825|quote=Searle's form of argument is a familiar one to philosophers: he has constructed what one might call an intuition pump, a device for provoking a family of intuitions by producing variations on a basic thought experiment. An intuition pump is not, typically, an engine of discovery, but a persuader or pedagogical tool—a way of getting people to see things your way once you've seen the truth, as Searle thinks he has. I would be the last to disparage the use of intuition pumps—I love to use them myself—but they can be abused. In this instance I think Searle relies almost entirely on ill-gotten gains: favorable intuitions generated by misleadingly presented thought experiments.|pages=429-429}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', he uses the term to describe [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, characterizing it as designed to elicit intuitive but incorrect answers by formulating the description in such a way that important implications of the experiment would be difficult to imagine and tend to be ignored.

In the case of the Chinese room argument, Dennett considers the intuitive notion that a person manipulating symbols seems inadequate to constitute any form of consciousness, and says that this notion ignores the requirements of [[memory]], [[recollection|recall]], [[emotion]], world [[knowledge]], and [[rationality]] that the system would actually need to pass such a test. "Searle does not deny that programs can have all this structure, of course", Dennett says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dennett |first=Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=The Penguin Press |location=Allen Lane |page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He simply discourages us from attending to it. But if we are to do a good job imagining the case, we are not only entitled but obliged to imagine that the program Searle is hand-simulating has all this structure—and more, if only we can imagine it. But then it is no longer obvious, I trust, that there is no genuine understanding of the joke going on."

In his 1984 book, ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett used the term in a positive sense to describe thought experiments which facilitate the understanding of or reasoning about complex subjects by harnessing intuition:
{{quote|A popular strategy in philosophy is to construct a certain sort of thought experiment I call an ''intuition pump''. ... Intuition pumps are cunningly designed to focus the reader's attention on "the important" features, and to deflect the reader from bogging down in hard-to-follow details. There is nothing wrong with this in principle. Indeed one of philosophy's highest callings is finding ways of helping people see the forest and not just the trees. But intuition pumps are often abused, though seldom deliberately.}}

'''Light-time correction''' is a displacement in the ''[[apparent place|apparent position]]'' of a celestial object from its ''true position'' (or ''geometric position'') caused by the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer.

Light-time correction occurs in principle during the observation of any moving object, because the [[speed of light]] is finite. The magnitude and direction of the displacement in position depends upon the distance of the object from the observer and the motion of the object, and is measured at the instant at which the object's light reaches the observer. It is ''independent'' of the motion of the observer. It should be contrasted with the [[aberration of light]], which depends upon the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the observer at the time of observation, and is independent of the motion or distance of the object.

Light-time correction can be applied to any object whose distance and motion are known. In particular, it is usually necessary to apply it to the motion of a [[planet]] or other [[solar system]] object. For this reason, the combined displacement of the apparent position due to the effects of light-time correction and aberration is known as ''planetary aberration''. By convention, light-time correction is not applied to the positions of stars, because their [[proper motion|motion]] and distance may not be known accurately.

==Calculation==

A calculation of light-time correction usually involves an [[iteration|iterative]] process. An approximate light-time is calculated by dividing the object's geometric distance from [[Earth]] by the speed of light. Then the object's velocity is multiplied by this approximate light-time to determine its approximate displacement through space during that time. Its previous position is used to calculate a more precise light-time. This process is repeated as necessary. For planetary motions, a few (3–5) iterations are sufficient to match the accuracy of the underlying [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]].

==Discovery==

The effect of the finite speed of light on observations of celestial objects was first recognised by [[Ole Rømer]] in 1675, during a series of observations of [[eclipse]]s of the [[moons of Jupiter|moons]] of [[Jupiter]]. He found that the interval between eclipses was less when Earth and Jupiter are approaching each other, and more when they are moving away from each other. He correctly deduced that this difference was caused by the appreciable time it took for light to travel from Jupiter to the observer on Earth.

In the mathematical field of [[order theory]], a '''continuum''' or '''linear continuum''' is a generalization of the [[real line]].
 
Formally, a linear continuum is a [[linearly ordered set]] ''S'' of more than one element that is [[Dense order|densely ordered]], i.e., between any two distinct elements there is another (and hence infinitely many others), and which "lacks gaps" in the sense that every non-empty subset with an upper bound has a [[least upper bound]]. More symbolically:
&lt;ol type=a&gt;&lt;!--Referred to in text below as "property a" and "property b"--&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ''S'' has the [[least-upper-bound property]], and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For each ''x'' in ''S'' and each ''y'' in ''S'' with ''x'' &lt; ''y'', there exists ''z'' in ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] has the least upper bound property, if every [[nonempty]] [[subset]] of the set that is bounded above has a [[least upper bound]]. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of [[topology]] where they can be used to verify whether an [[total order|ordered set]] given the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=31,153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the standard real line, a linear continuum may be bounded on either side: for example, any (real) [[closed interval]] is a linear continuum.

==Examples==
* The ordered set of [[real number]]s, '''R''', with its usual [[Total order|order]] is a linear continuum, and is the archetypal example. Property b) is trivial, and property a) is simply a reformulaton of the [[completeness axiom]].

Examples in addition to the real numbers:
*sets which are [[Order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]] to the set of real numbers, for example a real open interval, and the same with half-open gaps (note that these are not gaps in the above-mentioned sense)
*the [[affinely extended real number system]] and order-isomorphic sets, for example the [[unit interval]]
*the set of real numbers with only +∞ or only −∞ added, and order-isomorphic sets, for example a half-open interval
*the [[long line (topology)|long line]]
* The set ''I'' × ''I'' (where × denotes the [[Cartesian product]] and ''I'' = [0, 1]) in the [[lexicographic order]] is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial. To check property a), we define a map, π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''I'' × ''I'' → ''I'' by:

:''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'', ''y'') = ''x''

This map is known as the [[projection map]]. The projection map is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] (with respect to the product topology on ''I'' × ''I'') and is [[surjective]]. Let ''A'' be a nonempty subset of ''I'' × ''I'' which is bounded above. Consider ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). Since ''A'' is bounded above, ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') must also be bounded above. Since, ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a subset of ''I'', it must have a least [[upper bound]] (since ''I'' has the [[least upper bound property]]). Therefore, we may let ''b'' be the least upper bound of ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). If ''b'' belongs to ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b'' × ''I'' will intersect ''A'' at say ''b'' × ''c'' for some ''c'' ∈ ''I''. Notice that since ''b'' × ''I'' has the same [[order type]] of ''I'', the set (''b'' × ''I'') ∩ ''A'' will indeed have a least upper bound ''b'' × ''c''', which is the desired least upper bound for ''A''.

If ''b'' does not belong to ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b'' × 0 is the least upper bound of ''A'', for if ''d'' &lt; ''b'', and ''d'' × ''e'' is an upper bound of ''A'', then ''d'' would be a smaller upper bound of ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') than ''b'', contradicting the unique property of ''b''.

==Non-examples==
* The set of [[rational number]]s is not a linear continuum. Even though property b) is satisfied, property a) is not. Consider the subset:

::''A'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' &lt; {{radic|2}} }

: of the set of rational numbers. Even though this set is bounded above by any rational number greater than {{radic|2}} (for instance 3), it has no [[least upper bound]] in the rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=G.H.|title=A Course of Pure Mathematics, 10th ed.|year=1952|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-09227-2|pages=11–15, 24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Specifically, for any rational upper bound ''r'' &gt; {{radic|2}}, ''r''/2 + 1/''r''  is a closer rational upper bound; details at {{section link|Methods of computing square roots|Babylonian method}}.)

* The set of non-negative [[integer]]s with its usual order is not a linear continuum. Property a) is satisfied (let ''A'' be a subset of the set of non-negative integers that is bounded above. Then ''A'' is [[Finite set|finite]] so that it has a maximum. This maximum is the desired least upper bound of ''A''). On the other hand, property b) is not. Indeed, 5 is a non-negative integer and so is 6, but there exists no non-negative integer that lies strictly between them.
* The [[total order|ordered set]] ''A'' of nonzero real numbers:

::''A'' = (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, +∞)

: is not a linear continuum. Property b) is trivially satisfied. However, if ''B'' is the set of negative real numbers:

::''B'' = (−∞, 0)

: then ''B'' is a subset of ''A'' which is bounded above (by any element of ''A'' greater than 0; for instance 1), but has no least upper bound in ''B''. Notice that 0 is not a bound for ''B'' since 0 is not an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A''.

* Let Z&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; denote the set of negative integers and let A = (0,5) ∪ (5,+∞). Let:

::S = Z&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ A

: Then S satisfies neither property a) nor property b). The proof is similar to the previous examples.

==Topological properties==
Even though linear continua are important in the study of [[total order|ordered sets]], they do have applications in the mathematical field of [[topology]]. In fact, we will prove that an [[total order|ordered set]] in the [[order topology]] is [[Connected space|connected]] if and only if it is a linear continuum (notice the 'if and only if' part). We will prove one implication, and leave the other one as an exercise. (Munkres explains the second part of the proof &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James|title=Topology, 2nd ed.|year=2000|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-181629-2|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Theorem'''

Let ''X'' be an ordered set in the [[order topology]]. If ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''X'' is a linear continuum.

''Proof:''

Suppose, x is in X and y is in X where x &lt; y. If there exists no z in X such that x &lt; z &lt; y, consider the sets:

A = (−∞, y)

B = (x, +∞)

These sets are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] (If a is in A, a &lt; y so that if a is in B, a &gt; x and a &lt; y which is impossible by hypothesis), [[nonempty]] (x is in A and y is in B) and open (in the [[order topology]]) and their union is X. This contradicts the connectedness of X.

Now we prove the least upper bound property. If C is a subset of X that is bounded above and has no least upper bound, let D be the union of all [[order topology|open rays]] of the form (b, +∞) where b is an upper bound for C. Then D is [[open set|open]] (since it is the union of open sets), and [[Closed set|closed]] (if 'a' is not in D, then a &amp;lt; b for all upper bounds b of C so that we may choose q &amp;gt; a such that q is in C (if no such q exists, a is the least upper bound of C), then an [[order topology|open interval]] containing a, may be chosen that doesn't intersect D). Since D is nonempty (there is more than one upper bound of D for if there was exactly one upper bound s, s would be the least upper bound. Then if b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two upper bounds of D with b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will belong to D), D and its complement together form a [[separated sets|separation]] on X. This contradicts the [[connectedness]] of X.

===Applications of the theorem===
1. Since the [[total order|ordered set]]:

A = (−∞, 0) U (0,+∞)

is not a linear continuum, it is disconnected.

2. By applying the theorem just proved, the fact that R is [[Connected space|connected]] follows. In fact any interval (or ray) in R is also connected.

3. The set of [[integers]] is not a linear continuum and therefore cannot be connected.

4. In fact, if an ordered set in the order topology is a linear continuum, it must be connected. Since any interval in this set is also a linear continuum, it follows that this space is [[locally connected space|locally connected]] since it has a [[Basis (topology)|basis]] consisting entirely of connected sets.

5. For an example of a [[topological space]] that is a linear continuum, see [[long line (topology)|long line]].

A '''linear system''' is a [[mathematical model]] of a [[system]] based on the use of a [[linear operator]].
Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the [[nonlinear]] case.
As a mathematical abstraction or idealization, linear systems find important applications in [[automatic control]] theory, [[signal processing]], and [[telecommunications]]. For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be
modeled by linear systems.

==Definition==
A general [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic system]] can be described by an operator, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, that maps an input, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to an output, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a type of [[Black box (systems)|black box]] description.  Linear systems satisfy the property of [[Superposition principle|superposition]]. Given two valid inputs 
:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
as well as their respective outputs
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = H \left \{ x_1(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = H \left \{ x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
then a linear system must satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha y_1(t) + \beta y_2(t) = H \left \{ \alpha x_1(t) + \beta x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
for any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- Insert picture depicting the superposition and scaling properties --&gt;

The system is then defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some arbitrary function of time, and &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the system state.  Given &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be solved for.  For example, a simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2(x)}{dt^2} = -kx&lt;/math&gt;.

If
:&lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = m \frac{d^2(x(t))}{dt^2} + kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator.  Letting &lt;math&gt;y(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can rewrite the differential equation as &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.

The behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs.  In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation.  
This mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems.
For [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems this is the basis of the [[impulse response]] or the [[frequency response]] methods (see [[LTI system theory]]), which describe a general input function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of unit [[Dirac's delta function|impulses]] or [[frequency components]].  

Typical [[differential equation]]s of linear [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems are well adapted to analysis using the [[Laplace transform]] in the [[continuous function|continuous]] case, and the [[Z-transform]] in the [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] case (especially in computer implementations).

Another perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s which act like [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s in the geometric sense.

A common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by [[linearization]].  This is usually done for mathematical convenience.

==Time-varying impulse response==
The '''time-varying impulse response''' ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a single [[impulse function|impulse]] applied at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, if the input ''x''(''t'') to a linear system is 

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \delta(t-t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where δ(''t'') represents the [[Dirac delta function]], and the corresponding response ''y''(''t'') of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) |_{t=t_2} = h(t_2,t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the function  ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following '''causality condition''' must be satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt; h(t_2,t_1)=0, t_2&lt;t_1 &lt;/math&gt;

==The convolution integral==

The output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t,t') x(t')dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t,t') x(t') dt' &lt;/math&gt;

If the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be '''time-invariant''' and h() is a function only of the time difference τ = t-t' which is zero for τ&lt;0 (namely t&lt;t'). By redefinition of h() it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau  = \int_{0}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau &lt;/math&gt;

Linear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called  the ''transfer function'' which is:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) =\int_0^\infty  h(t) e^{-st}\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of s. Because h(t) is zero for negative t, the integral may  equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting s = iω follows the formula for the ''frequency response function'':

:&lt;math&gt; H(i\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt &lt;/math&gt;

==Discrete time systems==
The output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{n} { h[n,m] x[m] }  = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[n,m] x[m] }&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently for a time-invariant system on redefining h(),

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{k =0}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] } = \sum_{k =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] }&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; k = n-m \, &lt;/math&gt;

represents the lag time between the stimulus at time ''m'' and the response at time ''n''.

'''''Marxism and Morality''''' is a 1985 book by the political and social theorist [[Steven Lukes]]. The book was praised by commentators, who credited Lukes with showing the paradoxes inherent within Marxist approaches to morality. It has been called a classic introduction.

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Marxism and Morality'' was reviewed by the philosopher [[Arthur Danto]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Danto|1985|page=1052}}

===Academic journals===
''Marxism and Morality'' received positive reviews from Michael Perelman in the ''Southern Economic Journal'' and Alan Swingewood in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]''.{{sfn|Perelman|1986|page=293}}{{sfn|Swingewood|1988|pages=134–135}} The book was also reviewed by Michael Donnelly in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' and May Ellen Batiuk in ''[[Humanity &amp; Society]]'',{{sfn|Donnelly|1987|pages=716–718}}{{sfn|Batiuk|1990|pages=89–91}} and discussed by David Bankhurst in ''Praxis International''.{{sfn|Bankhurst|1985|pages=209–223}}

Perelman described the book as "a work of disarming simplicity that brings together much of the far reaching literature on the subject of marxism and morality." He credited Lukes with "bringing both scholarship and intelligence to his subject matter", finding Lukes's discussion of the wage/labor relationship especially successful. He disagreed with Lukes that [[Karl Marx]] underestimated the importance of values such as freedom of the press, writing that "the effective use of such freedom rarely extended beyond the privileged strata of society", and criticized Lukes for neglecting Marx's insight that capitalists and workers both behave through "character masks." He concluded that, "Despite its shortcomings, Lukes offers us a useful, though idiosyncratic vision of Marx's theory of morality."{{sfn|Perelman|1986|page=293}}

Swingewood described the book as "a notable contribution to current debates on the problems of socialist ethics and moral theory". He credited Lukes with offering "a concise and cogently argued analysis of the many paradoxes within [[Marxism]] on ethics and moral theory." He called Lukes's chapter on the "means-ends debate" "brilliant", writing that Lukes showed how "the possibility of alternative means (and thus the need to argue for them outside the framework of historical necessity) was largely ignored." He concluded that, "Lukes's book is an important contribution to the contemporary debate on the renewal of democratic socialism."{{sfn|Swingewood|1988|pages=134–135}}

Bankhurst praised Lukes for his "honesty and responsibility" in confronting the issue of whether Marxism suffers from a "deep-rooted theoretical incoherence" that accounts for its "terrible record" in political life, commenting that, "In the realm of morality" Marx's thought "does seem to abound in paradoxes and peculiarities." He credited Lukes with correctly characterizing Marx's basic outlook on morality as an analysis of it "as an expression of class struggle" combined with "the dismissal of the prevailing moral orthodoxy as the embodiment of the interests of the dominant class."{{sfn|Bankhurst|1985|pages=209–223}}

===Evaluations in books===
The political theorist [[Terrell Carver]] called ''Marxism and Morality'' a classic introduction to its subject in an appendix to the 1995 edition of the philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s ''[[Karl Marx: His Life and Environment]]''.{{sfn|Carver|Berlin|1995|page=214}}

'''Material flow''' is the description of the transportation of raw materials, pre-fabricates, parts, components, integrated objects and final products as a flow of entities. The term applies mainly to advanced modeling of [[supply chain management]].

As industrial material flow can easily become very complex, several different specialized simulation tools have been developed for complex systems. Typical tools are:
* [[AnyLogic]]
* AutoMod for logistics systems
* [[Plant Simulation]] for production system

'''Maxine Syjuco''' (born December 1, 1984) is an artist, poet and model from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. She is the youngest daughter of [[avant-garde]] artists [[Cesare Syjuco]] and [[Jean Marie Syjuco]],&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the vocalist and songwriter of the experimental Art Rock band Jack of None.&lt;ref&gt;http://jackofnone.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

Working mainly with [[photography]], [[digital collage]], [[painting]] and [[installation art]], her work possesses an intimate, philosophical, and often twisted voice in storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulating faces, unveiling poignant surrealities, and probing into abandoned rooms of the subconscious, Maxine authors dark, thought-provoking introspections of the human condition and its fragility—conjuring a netherworld where ghostly images exist neither here nor there.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinformal.com/artists/view/217/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book of poetry, ''"A Secret Life,"'' was published in 2008 and received critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;http://prairieschooner.unl.edu/people/maxine-syjuco&lt;/ref&gt; Her poems have been translated into Polish and French, and have seen print in several international anthologies including the Asia Literary Review, The Poet’s Guild Quarterly, Chopin with Cherries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moonrisepress.com/chopin.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 Rhino International Poetry Anthology.&lt;ref&gt;http://rhinopoetry.org/the-journal/past-issues/rhino-poetry-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she was awarded the Independent Music Award in New York City, U.S.A., for Best Album Art, Photography and Design. In the same competition, her band, Jack of None, received 2 category nominations (Best Spoken Word Song, and Best Album of the Year) for their debut album titled "Who's Listening to Van Gogh's Ear?".&lt;ref&gt;http://independentmusicawards.com/blog/2016/11/17/the-15th-independent-music-awards-winners-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2016/11/28/1647984/flying-syjucos&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxine's exhibits and poetry-performances have taken place in venues as varied as the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Manila]], the Tokiwa Museum of Japan, the Hangaram Museum of Korea, the Art Takes Miami Exhibition in the U.S.A., and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://theartling.com/artists/maxine-syjuco/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18792">A '''momentum exchange tether''' is a kind of [[space tether]] that could theoretically be used as a launch system, or to change spacecraft orbits.  Momentum exchange tethers create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to [[Centrifugal force|the pseudo-force known as centrifugal force]].  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A non-rotating tether is a rotating tether that rotates exactly once per orbit so that it always has a vertical orientation relative to the parent body.  A spacecraft arriving at the lower end of this tether, or departing from the upper end, will take momentum from the tether, while a spacecraft departing from the lower end of the tether, or arriving at the upper end, will add momentum to the tether. 

In some cases momentum exchange systems are intended to run as balanced transportation schemes where an arriving spacecraft or payload is exchanged with one leaving with the same speed and mass, and then no net change in momentum or angular momentum occurs.

== Tether systems ==

=== Tidal stabilization ===
{{Main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}
[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating tether and a tidally stabilized tether in orbit]]

Gravity-gradient stabilization, also called "gravity stabilization" and "tidal stabilization", is a simple and reliable method for controlling the attitude of a satellite that requires no electronic control systems, rocket motors or propellant.

This type of [[attitude control]] tether has a small mass on one end, and a [[satellite]] on the other. [[Tidal force]]s stretch the tether between the two masses. There are two ways of explaining tidal forces. In one, the upper end mass of the system is moving faster than orbital velocity for its altitude, so [[centrifugal force]] makes it want to move further away from the planet it is orbiting. At the same time, the lower end mass of the system is moving at less than orbital speed for its altitude, so it wants to move closer to the planet.  The end result is that the tether is under constant tension and wants to hang in a vertical orientation. The other way to explain tidal force is that the top of a tall object weighs less than the bottom, so they are pulled by different amounts. The "extra" pull on the "bottom" of the object stretches it out. On [[Earth]], these are small effects, but in space, nothing opposes them.  Either way, the end result is that the tidal forces stabilize the satellite so that its long dimension points towards the planet it is orbiting. Simple satellites have often been stabilized this way; either with tethers, or with how the mass is distributed within the satellite.

As with any freely hanging object, it can be disturbed and start to swing.  Since there is no atmospheric drag in space to slow the swing, a small bottle of fluid with baffles may be mounted in the spacecraft to damp the pendulum vibrations via the viscous friction of the fluid.

==== Sky-hook ====
{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}
A sky-hook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Moravec, "A non-synchronous orbital skyhook". ''Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 307–322, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Colombo, E. M. Gaposchkin, M. D. Grossi, and G. C. Weiffenbach, “The sky-hook: a shuttle-borne tool for low-orbital-altitude research,” Meccanica, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 3–20, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, Tethers in Space Handbook, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala, USA, 3rd edition, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.L. Johnson, B. Gilchrist, R. D. Estes, and E. Lorenzini, "Overview of future NASA tether applications," ''Advances in Space Research'', vol. 24, no. 8, pp. 1055–1063, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Levin, "Dynamic Analysis of Space Tether Missions", ''American Astronautical Society'', Washington, DC, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for sky-hooks include designs that employ tethers spinning at hyper-sonic speed for catching high speed payloads or high altitude aircraft and placing them in orbit.&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt;

=== Electrodynamic tethers ===
{{Main article|Electrodynamic tether}}
[[Image:USP6116544-Circuit.png|thumb|left|Electrons flow through the conductive structure of the tether to the power system interface, where it supplies power to an associated load, not shown. (Source: U.S. patent 6,116,544, "Electrodynamic Tether And Method of Use".)]]

In a strong planetary [[magnetic field]] such as around the Earth, a conducting tether can be configured as an [[electrodynamic tether]]. This can either be used as a [[dynamo]] to generate power for the satellite at the cost of slowing its orbital velocity, or it can be used to increase the orbital velocity of the satellite by putting power into the tether from the satellite's power system. Thus the tether can be used to either accelerate or to slow an [[orbit]]ing spacecraft without using any rocket propellant.&lt;ref name= "handbook"&gt;[[NASA]], [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980018321_1998056794.pdf Tethers In Space Handbook], edited by M. L. Cosmo and E. C. Lorenzini, third edition December 1997 (accessed 20 October 2010); see also version of [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/337451main_Tethers_In_Space_Handbook_Section_1_2.pdf NASA MSFC]; available on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/13841374/Tethers-in-Space-Handbook-3rd-Ed Scribd]&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this techniques with a rotating tether, the current through the tether must alternate in phase with the rotation rate of the tether in order to produce either a consistent slowing force or a consistent accelerating force.

Whether slowing or accelerating the satellite, the electrodynamic tether pushes against the planet's magnetic field, and thus the momentum gained or lost ultimately comes from the planet.

=== Bolo ===

A Bolo, or rotating tether, is a tether that rotates more than once per orbit and whose endpoints have a significant tip speed (~ 1 – 3&amp;nbsp;km/s).  The maximum speed of the endpoints is limited by the strength of the cable material and the safety factor it is designed for.

The purpose of the Bolo is to either speed up, or slow down, a spacecraft that docks with it without using any of the spacecraft's on-board propellant and to change the spacecraft's orbital flight path.  Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.

The momentum imparted to the spacecraft by the Bolo is not free. In the same way that the Bolo changes the spacecraft's momentum and direction of travel, the Bolo's orbital [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum|rotational momentum]] is also changed, and this costs [[energy]] that must be replaced. The idea is that the replacement energy would come from a more efficient and lower cost source than a chemical rocket motor.  Two possible lower cost sources for this replacement energy are an ion propulsion system, or an electrodynamic tether propulsion system that would be part of the Bolo. An essentially free source of replacement energy is momentum gathered from payloads to be accelerated in the other direction, suggesting that the need for adding energy from propulsion systems will be quite minimal with balanced, two-way, space commerce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Rotovator ===
[[File:Cycloid f.gif|right|thumb|If the orbital velocity and the tether rotation rate are synchronized, in the rotovator concept the tether tip moves in a cycloid, and at the lowest point is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground, where it can "hook" a payload and swing it into orbit.)]]

Rotovators are rotating tethers with a rotational direction such that the lower endpoint of the tether is moving slower than the orbital velocity of the tether and the upper endpoint is moving faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/0671876864/0671876864_toc.htm] Indistinguishable From Magic [[Robert Forward]]- Chapter 4 Beanstalk&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] derived from the words ''[[wikt:rotor|rotor]]'' and ''[[elevator]]''.

If the tether is long enough and the rotation rate high enough, it is possible for the lower endpoint to completely cancel the orbital speed of the tether such that the lower endpoint is stationary with respect to the planetary surface that the tether is orbiting.  As described by Moravec,&lt;ref name="nonsynch"&gt;Hans Moravec, [https://archive.li/19991012232419/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx “Orbital Bridges”] (1986) (accessed Oct. 10, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "moravec87"&gt;Hans Moravec, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx "Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials"] (Hans Moravec's thoughts on skyhooks, tethers, rotavators, etc., as of 1987) (accessed 10 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; this is "a satellite that rotates like a wheel". The tip of the tether moves in approximately a [[cycloid]], in which it is momentarily stationary with respect to the ground. In this case, a payload that is "grabbed" by a capture mechanism on the rotating tether during the moment when it is stationary would be picked up and lifted into orbit; and potentially could be released at the top of the rotation, at which point it is moving with a speed significantly greater than the escape velocity and thus could be released onto an interplanetary trajectory. (As with the bolo, discussed above, the momentum and energy given to the payload must be made up, either with a high-efficiency rocket engine, or with momentum gathered from payload moving the other direction.)

On bodies with an atmosphere, such as the Earth, the tether tip must stay above the dense atmosphere. On bodies with reasonably low orbital speed (such as the [[Moon]] and possibly [[Mars]]), a rotovator in low orbit can potentially touch the ground, thereby providing cheap surface transport as well as launching materials into [[cislunar space]]. In January 2000, [[The Boeing Company]] completed a study of tether launch systems including [[two-stage tethers]] that had been commissioned by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]].&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Thomas J. |last=Bogar |first2=Michal E. |last2=Bangham |first3=Robert L. |last3=Forward |first4=Mark J. |last4=Lewis |contribution=Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch System |title=Research Grant No. 07600-018l Phase I Final Report |publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts |date=7 January 2000 |contribution-url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/355Bogar.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth launch assist bolo===

Unfortunately an Earth-to-orbit rotovator cannot be built from currently available materials since the thickness and tether mass to handle the loads on the rotovator would be uneconomically large. A "watered down" rotovator with two-thirds the rotational speed, however, would halve the centripetal acceleration stresses.

Therefore, another trick to achieve lower stresses is that rather than picking up a cargo from the ground at zero velocity, a rotovator could pick up a moving vehicle and sling it into orbit. For example, a rotovator could pick up a [[mach number|Mach 12]] aircraft from the upper atmosphere of the Earth and move it into orbit without using rockets, and could likewise catch such a vehicle and lower it into atmospheric flight. It is easier for a rocket to achieve the lower tip speed, so "single stage to tether" has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;AIAA95-2895 "Potential launch cost savings of a tether transport facility"&lt;/ref&gt; One such is called the Hyper-sonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL).&lt;ref name="Boeing.2000"/&gt; Either air breathing or rocket to tether could save a great deal of fuel per flight, and would permit for both a simpler vehicle and more cargo.

===Space elevator ===
{{Main article|Space elevator}}
[[File:Mature non-rotating Skyhook.png|thumb|right|upright|Non-rotating Sky-hook first proposed by E. Sarmont in 1990]]

A [[space elevator]] is a space tether that is attached to a planetary body. For example, on [[Earth]], a space elevator would go from the equator to well above geosynchronous orbit.

A space elevator does not need to be powered as a rotovator does, because it gets any required [[angular momentum]] from the planetary body. The disadvantage is that it is much longer, and for many planets a space elevator cannot be constructed from known materials. A space elevator on Earth would require material strengths outside current technological limits (2014).&lt;ref name="io9.why"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorsky |first=G. |title=Why we'll probably never build a space elevator |work=io9.com |date=13 February 2013 |url=http://io9.com/5984371/why-well-probably-never-build-a-space-elevator }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop.15185070"&gt;{{cite web |last=Feltman |first=R. |title=Why Don't We Have Space Elevators? |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=7 March 2013 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/nasa/why-dont-we-have-space-elevators-15185070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff.3353697"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jillian |last=Scharr |title=Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=29 May 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[planet Mars|Martian]] and [[lunar space elevator]]s could be built with modern-day materials however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html Space Elevator - Chapter 7: Destinations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025102330/http://isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/chapter7.html |date=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A space elevator on Phobos has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030065879_2003074809.pdf Space Colonization Using Space-Elevators from Phobos, Leonard M. Weinstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space elevators also have larger amounts of potential energy than a rotovator, and if heavy parts (like a "dropped wrench") should fall they would reenter at a steep angle and impact the surface at near orbital speeds. On most anticipated designs, if the cable component itself fell, it would burn up before hitting the ground.

===Cislunar transportation system===
[[Image:Cislunar potential.png|thumb|right|Potential energy in the Earth–Moon system. Because the Moon has higher potential energy, tethers can work together to pick an object off the Moon (the tiny dimple on the right), and place it closer to the Earth in LEO, taking essentially no propellant and even generating energy while doing so.]]

Although it might be thought that this requires constant energy input, it can in fact be shown to be energetically favorable to lift cargo off the surface of the [[Moon]] and drop it into a lower Earth orbit, and thus it can be achieved without any significant use of propellant, since the Moon's surface is in a comparatively higher potential energy state. Also, this system could be built with a total mass of less than 28 times the mass of the payloads.&lt;ref name=lunarforward&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf "Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface", R. L. Forward, AIAA paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LDC00Cislunar.pdf THE CISLUNAR TETHER TRANSPORT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, Robert P. Hoyt, Tethers Unlimited, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotovators can thus be charged by [[momentum]] exchange. Momentum charging uses the rotovator to move mass from a place that is "higher" in a [[gravity field]] to a place that is "lower". The technique to do this uses the [[Oberth effect]], where releasing the payload when the tether is moving with higher linear speed, lower in a gravitational potential gives more [[specific energy]], and ultimately more speed than the energy lost picking up the payload at a higher gravitational potential, even if the rotation rate is the same. For example, it is possible to use a system of two or three rotovators to implement trade between the [[Moon]] and [[Earth]]. The rotovators are charged by lunar mass (dirt, if exports are not available) dumped on or near the Earth, and can use the momentum so gained to boost Earth goods to the Moon. The momentum and energy exchange can be balanced with equal flows in either direction, or can increase over time.

Similar systems of rotovators could theoretically open up inexpensive transportation throughout the [[solar system]].

=== Tether cable catapult system ===

A tether cable catapult system is a system where two or more long conducting tethers are held rigidly in a straight line, attached to a heavy mass. Power is applied to the tethers and is picked up by a vehicle that has linear magnet motors on it, which it uses to push itself along the length of the cable. Near the end of the cable the vehicle releases a payload and slows and stops itself and the payload carries on at very high velocity. The calculated maximum speed for this system is extremely high, more than 30 times the speed of sound in the cable; and velocities of more than 30&amp;nbsp;km/s seem to be possible.&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6290186&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''peace congress''', in [[international relations]], has at times been defined in a way that would distinguish it from a [[peace conference]] (usually defined as a diplomatic meeting to decide on a [[peace treaty]]), as an ambitious forum to carry out dispute resolution in international affairs, and prevent wars. This idea was widely promoted during the nineteenth century, anticipating the international bodies that would be set up in the twentieth century with comparable aims.

==History==

The genesis of the idea of a [[meeting]] of representatives of different [[nation]]s to obtain by peaceful arbitrament a settlement of differences has been traced to the year 1623 in modern history, to a French monk, [[Émeric Crucé]], who wrote a work entitled "The New Cyneas", a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general [[peace]] and [[liberty of conscience]] to all the world and addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably [[Venice]], should be selected where all the powers had ambassadors and that there should be a [[world government|universal]] union, including all [[people]]s. He suggested careful arrangement as to priority, giving the first place to the pope.

Two years after this publication, in 1625, appeared in Latin the work of [[Hugo Grotius]] "On the Right of War and Peace", pleading for a mitigation of some of the barbarous usages of war.

[[William Penn]]  had a plan for the establishment of a "European Dyet, Parliament or Estates". He was followed by other writers of different nationalities.

The concept of a peaceful community of [[nation]]s had also been outlined in 1795, when [[Immanuel Kant]]’s ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;Skirbekk and Gilje 2001, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote [[collective security]] originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic War]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;Reichard 2006, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport 1995, pp. 498-500&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchet-Saulnier, Brav, and Olivier 2007, pp. 14-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889.  The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914.  Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration.    The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Before the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses==

===Vienna===

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France]] an international peace congress took place in [[Vienna]] called the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

===The Americas in the nineteenth century===

In 1826, a congress composed of representatives of Spanish-American countries was planned by [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] for military as well as political purposes. One of its declared objects was "to promote the peace and union of American nations and establish amicable methods for the settlement of disputes between them". This congress failed, as only four Spanish-American countries were represented and only one ratified the agreement.

In 1831, however, [[Mexico]] took up the subject and proposed a conference of [[United States|American]] Republics "for the purpose of bringing about not only a union and close alliance for defence, but also the acceptance of friendly mediation for the settlement of disputes between them, and the framing and promulgation of a code of penal laws to regulate their mutual relations". It does not appear that anything came of this congress, and in 1847 another was held at [[Lima]], attended by representatives of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Peru]], for the purpose of forming an alliance of American republics. The United States was invited but as it was then at war with Mexico it sent no representative.

Another congress was held by representatives from the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela, in 1864.

An effort to hold a congress was made by the governments of Chile and Colombia in 1880, "to the end that the settlement by arbitration of each and every international controversy should become a principle of American public law". This congress did not meet, however, owing to a war between Chile and Peru.

In 1881, the [[President of the United States]] invited the independent countries of North and South America to meet in a general congress at [[Washington, D.C.]] on 24 November 1882, "for the purpose of considering and discussing methods of preventing war between the nations of America". This meeting did not take place owing to a variety of reasons, but subsequently, by virtue of an [[Act of Congress of the United States]] an invitation was issued by the president to Mexico, the Central and South American Republics, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Brazil to join in a conference to be held in the city of Washington, the project being to consider:

* (1) measures tending to preserve the peace and promote the prosperity of the South American States;
* (2) measures looking to the formation of an American Customs Union;
* (3) the establishment of regular and frequent communication between the various countries;
* (4) the establishment of a uniform system of customs regulations, invoices, [[sanitation of ships]], and [[quarantine]];
* (5) the adoption of a uniform system of [[weights and measures]], and of laws to protect patent rights, copyrights, and trade marks, and for the extradition of criminals;
* (6) the adoption of a common silver coin;
* (7) the adoption of a definite plan of arbitration of all questions, disputes, and differences; and
* (8) such other subjects relating to the welfare of the several States as might be presented by any of them.

The [[First International Conference of American States]] assembled at Washington on 2 October 1889. Eighteen American nations, including the United States, had their representatives. The conference adopted a plan of arbitration of international differences, together with various recommendations relating to trade, law, extradition, patents, customs, and sanitary regulations. It further declared arbitration to be a principle of American International Law and obligatory "in all controversies concerning diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories, indemnities, the right of navigation, and the validity, construction and enforcement of treaties; and that it should be equally obligatory in all other cases, whatever might be their origin, nature or object, with the sole exception of those which in the judgment of one of the nations involved in the controversy, might imperil its independence; but that even in this case, while arbitration for that nation should be optional, it should be obligatory on the adversary power" (7 Moore Int. Law Dig. p.&amp;nbsp;7). One notable result of the conference was the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics. All the republics of South America are represented in this bureau, which continues for periods of ten years subject to renewal.

===American Civil War===

The [[Peace Conference of 1861]] was a last-ditch effort to avert the coming Civil War.

===Friends of Peace===

{{main|International Peace Congress}}
Following an initial congress at London in 1843, an annual series of congresses called [[International Congress of the Friends of Peace]] or more informally "International Peace Congress" were organised from 1848 until 1853.

[[Elihu Burritt]] organized the Congress of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Burritt, Elihu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants met at [[Brussels, Belgium|Brussels]] in September of that year.  Among the distinguished delegates were [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[Augustin Thierry|Thierry]], [[Emile de Girardin|Girardin]], and [[Frédéric Bastiat|Bastiat]].  The congress adopted resolutions urging limitation of armaments and the placing of a ban upon foreign loans for war purposes.  Through the next decade, more congresses were convened in various cities without the development of anything new in principle or method.

* 1st congress: [[London]] (1843)
* 2nd congress: [[Brussels]] (1848)
* 3rd congress: [[Paris]] (1849)
* 4th congress: [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1850)
* 5th congress: [[London]] (1851)
* 6th congress: [[Manchester]] (1852)
* 7th congress: [[Edinburgh]] (1853)

===The Hague===
{{main|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907}}

====First Hague Conference====

On 12 August 1898, in a circular letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider the problem of the preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at [[The Hague]] and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the [[United States]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Persia]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and the [[Netherlands]], and subsequently by [[Japan]]. A [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the signatory powers appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list of the members of the court when any of the signatory powers desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them.

The South and Central American republics were not represented at the conference, but at the second [[International Conference of American States]] which was initiated by President McKinley and held in the City of [[Mexico]], 22 October 1901, to 31 January 1902, a plan was adopted looking to adhesion to The Hague convention, the protocol being signed by all of the delegations except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]], who subsequently gave their adhesion. The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other signatory powers for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration.

====Second Hague Conference====

A second international peace conference was held at The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907. Forty-four States were represented, including the principal nations of Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The conference drew up thirteen conventions and one declaration. They are as follows: for the pacific settlement of international disputes; respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts relative to the opening of hostilities; respecting the laws and customs of war on land; respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land; relative to the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak of hostilities; relative to the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships; relative to the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; respecting bombardment by naval forces in time of war; for the adaptation to naval war of the principles of the Geneva Convention; relative to certain restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right of capture in naval war; relative to the creation of an International Prize Court; concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers in naval war; and a declaration prohibiting the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons.

===International League of Peace and Liberty===

The [[League of Peace and Freedom|International League of Peace and Liberty]] organised a series of international peace congresses.

* 1st congress: [[Geneva]] (1867)
* 2nd congress: [[Bern]] (1868)
* 3rd congress: ... (1873)
* 4th congress: ... (1889)

===World War I===

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], that sought a lasting peace after [[World War I]], approved the proposal to create the League of Nations ([[French language|French]]: ''Société des Nations'', [[German language|German]]: ''Völkerbund'') on 25 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 28 June 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Levinovitz and Ringertz 2001, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]] did not join the League.

The League held its first council meeting in [[Paris]] on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the headquarters of the League moved to [[Geneva]], where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10265">A '''piping and instrumentation diagram''' ('''P&amp;ID''') is a detailed diagram in the [[process industry]] which shows the [[piping]] and [[pressure vessel|vessel]]s in the process flow, together with the [[instrumentation]] and control devices.

Superordinate to the ''piping and instrumentation flowsheet'' is the ''[[process flow diagram]] (PFD)'' which indicates the more general flow of plant processes and equipment and relationship between major equipment of a plant facility.

==Contents and function==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]

[[Image:P&amp;ID.JPG|thumb|300px|A more complex example of a '''P&amp;ID'''.]]
A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID) is defined by the Institute of Instrumentation and Control as follows:
# A diagram which shows the interconnection of process equipment and the instrumentation used to control the process. In the process industry, a standard set of symbols is used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) Standard S5.1
# The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a [[process control]] installation.

They usually contain the following information:
*Process piping, sizes and identification, including:
**Pipe classes or piping line numbers
**Flow directions
**Interconnections references 
**Permanent start-up, flush and bypass lines
*Mechanical equipment and process control instrumentation and designation (names, numbers, unique tag identifiers), including:
**Valves and their identifications (e.g. isolation, shutoff, relief and [[safety valve]]s)
**Control inputs and outputs ([[sensor]]s and final elements, interlocks) 
**Miscellaneous - vents, drains, [[flange]]s, special fittings, sampling lines, reducers and increasers &lt;!-- and swagers  &lt;&lt; I could not find any references to "swager" in this context. What is a "swager"?--&gt;
*Interfaces for class changes 
*Computer control system 
*Identification of components and subsystems delivered by others

P&amp;IDs are originally drawn up at the design stage from a combination of process flow sheet data, the mechanical process equipment design, and the instrumentation engineering design.  During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a [[Hazard and operability study]] (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.

P&amp;IDs also play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process after initial build. Modifications are red-penned onto the diagrams and are vital records of the current plant design.

They are also vital in enabling development of;
*Control and shutdown schemes
*Safety and regulatory requirements
*Start-up sequences
*Operational understanding.

P&amp;IDs form the basis for the live mimic diagrams displayed on [[graphical user interface]]s of large [[industrial control system]]s such as [[SCADA]] and [[distributed control system]]s.

==Identification and reference designation==
Based on STANDARD [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the P&amp;ID is used for the identification of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the "tag" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.

For reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard [[IEC 61346]] (''Industrial systems, installations and equipment and industrial products — Structuring principles and reference designations'') can be applied. For the function  ''Measurement'' the reference designator '''B''' is used, followed by the above listed letter for the measured variable.

For reference designation of any equipment in a power station the [[KKS Power Plant Classification System]] can be applied.

The '''"Power of Women"''' (''Weibermacht'' in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and [[literary topos]], showing "heroic or wise men dominated by women", presenting "an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined by [[Susan L. Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000).

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig.

In [[United States criminal law]], '''probable cause''' is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal or the issuing of a [[search warrant]]. The principle behind the standard is to [[limited power|limit the power]] of authorities to perform random or abusive searches ([[unlawful search and seizure]]), and to promote lawful evidence gathering and procedural form during criminal arrest and prosecution. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/probable_cause|title=Probable Cause|last=Busby|first=John C|date=2009-09-17|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term comes from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]]:

{{Quote|The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, ''but upon probable cause'', supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.}}

''Probable'' in this case may relate to statistical [[probability]] or to a general standard of common behavior and customs. The context of the word ''probable'' here is not exclusive to community standards, and could partially derive from its use in formal mathematical statistics as some have suggested;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hald |first=Anders |title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1990 |page=44 |isbn=0471502308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''but cf. probō, Latin etymology.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/probo#Latin|title=probō, Wiktionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. immigration proceedings, the “reason to believe” standard has been interpreted as equivalent to probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/198382907/Jose-Manuel-Isabel-Diaz-A205-500-422-BIA-Dec-30-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A common definition is "a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a [[Reasonable person|prudent and cautious person's]] belief that certain facts are [[probability|probably]] true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handler |first=J. G. |title=Ballentine's Law Dictionary |edition=Legal Assistant |year=1994 |location=Albany |publisher=Delmar |page=431 |isbn=0827348746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition, allowing for use of the term by citizens and/or the general public.

In the context of warrants, the ''Oxford Companion to American Law'' defines probable cause as "information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)". "Probable cause" is a stronger standard of evidence than a [[reasonable suspicion]], but weaker than what is required to secure a [[criminal conviction]]. Even [[hearsay]] can supply probable cause if it is from a reliable source or supported by other evidence, according to the ''[[Aguilar–Spinelli test]]''.

In ''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] defines probable cause as "where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brinegar v. United States]]'', {{ussc|338|160|1949}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
[[File:Constitution of the United States WDL2708.jpg|thumb|Constitution of the United States]]
The use of probable cause in the United States and its integration in the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] has roots in [[English common law]] and the old saying that "a man's home is his castle". This is the idea that someone has the right to defend their "castle" or home from unwanted "attacks" or intrusion. In the 1600s, this saying started to apply legally to landowners to protect them from casual searches from government officials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=9780132457613|page=62|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1700s, the British use of the [[Writ of assistance|writs of assistance]] and general warrants, which allowed authorities to search wherever and whenever sometimes, without expiration date, in the American colonies were raised in several court cases. The first was in Massachusetts in 1761 when a customs agent submitted for a new writ of assistance and Boston merchants challenged its legality. In the case the lawyer for the merchants James Otis argued that writs of assistance violated the fundamentals of English Law and was unconstitutional. [[John Adams]], a lawyer at the time who later wrote the Massachusetts provision on which the Fourth Amendment heavily relied, was impacted by James Otis's argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zalman|first1=Marvin|title=Criminal Procedure: Constitution and Society|date=2011|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780132457613|page=63|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case against general warrants was the English case [[Entick v Carrington|''Entick v. Carrington'']] (1765). In that case, [[Lord Camden]] the chief judge said that general warrants were not the same as specific warrants and that parliament or case law could not authorize general warrants. Along with these statements, Lord Camden also affirmed that the needs of the state were more important than the individuals rights. This upheld the ideology of the social contract while holding to idea that the government purpose was to protect the property of the people.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; He called for the government to seek reasonable means in order to search private property, as well as a cause.

==Probationers and parolees==
In early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from "probable cause" to "reasonable grounds"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griffin v. Wisconsin]]'', {{ussc|483|868|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "reasonable suspicion". Specifically, the degree of individualized suspicion required of a search was a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. The Supreme Court held:

{{quote|Although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term "probable cause," a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable&amp;nbsp;... When an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer's significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Knights]]'', {{ussc|534|112|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion is not even necessary:

{{quote|The [[California Legislature]] has concluded that, given the number of inmates the State paroles and its high recidivism rate, a requirement that searches be based on individualized suspicion would undermine the State's ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders. This conclusion makes eminent sense. Imposing a reasonable suspicion requirement, as urged by petitioner, would give parolees greater opportunity to anticipate searches and conceal criminality.}}

The court held that reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, is the [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Samson v. California]]'', {{ussc|547|843|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Fourth Amendment rights be extended to probationers and parolees, but such proposals have not gained traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |volume=39|publisher=Hastings L.

California|author=Binnall, James M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/osjcl4&amp;section=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the requirement that a police officer must have individualized suspicion before searching a parolee's person and home was long considered a foundational element of the Court's analysis of Fourth Amendment questions and that abandoning it in the name of crime prevention represents an unprecedented blow to individual liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=42|publisher=Harv.

==Use of trained drug dogs==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0703-023, Dresden, Rauschgiftspürhund im Einsatz.jpg|thumb|185px|Right|Officer training a drug dog]]
In the United States, use of a [[drug dog|trained dog]] to smell for narcotics has been ruled in several court cases as sufficient probable cause. A K-9 Sniff in a public area is not a search according to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1983 ''[[United States v. Place]]''. In this particular case, Place was in the New York Airport, and [[DEA]] agents took his luggage, even though he refused to have his bag searched. His luggage smelled of drugs, and the trained dog alerted the agents to this. Dogs alerting their officers provides enough probable cause for the officer to obtain a warrant. The DEA then procured a [[Search warrant|warrant]] and found a sizable amount of drugs in Place's luggage. It was not considered a search until after the warrant because a trained dog can sniff out the smell of narcotics, without having to open and look through the luggage.

The power of probable cause by K-9 units smelling for drugs is not limited to just airports, but even in schools, public parking lots, high crime neighborhood streets, mail, visitors in prisons, traffic stops, etc. If there is an incident where the dog alerts its officer, the probable cause from the dog is considered enough to conduct a search, as long as one of the exceptions to a warrant are present, such as [[plain view doctrine|plain view]], [[incident to arrest]], automobile, [[exigency]], or with a [[stop and frisk]]. During a traffic stop and checkpoint, it is legal for police to allow a drug dog to sniff the exterior of the car. This is legal as long as it does not cause the traffic stop to be any longer than it would have been without the dog. If the dog finds a scent, it is again a substitute for probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;Wallentine, Ken. "The Dog Day Traffic Stop - Basic Canine Search and Seizure." (2008). Web. 21 Oct. 2014. http://policek9.com/html/drugdog.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyber surveillance==
Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], law enforcement officials do not need probable cause, in order to access communications records, credit cards, bank numbers and stored emails held by third parties. They only need reasonable suspicion that the information they are accessing is part of criminal activities.  Under this, officers are authorized for a court order to access the communication information.  Only certain information can be accessed under this act (such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, etc.). Probable cause is needed for more detailed information because law enforcement needs a warrant to access additional information.  Generally, law enforcement is not required to notify the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles. “The USA PATRIOT Act: A Legal Analysis”. (2002). Web. 30 Nov 2014. {{cite web |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206041849/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31377_20020415.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text of the Patriot Act limits the application of that statute to issues that clearly involve the national security of the United States. &lt;ref&gt;See the text of 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent to search==
{{main|Consent search}}

If voluntary consent is given and the individual giving the consent has authority over the search area, such as a car, house, business, etc. then a law enforcement officer does not need probable cause or even reasonable suspicion.  If the person does not give voluntary consent, then the officer needs probable cause, and in some cases, a search warrant may be required to search the premises.  Unless another exclusion to the fourth amendment of the US constitution occurs, when the person withdraws their consent for searching, the officer has to stop looking immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, Bryan R. “SEARCHING A VEHICLE WITHOUT A WARRANT” Web. 30 Nov 2014. https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/4th-amendment/searchingavehicle-consent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident investigation==
In the United States, the term probable cause is used in accident investigation to describe the conclusions reached by the investigating body as to the factor or factors which caused the accident.  This is primarily seen in reports on aircraft accidents, but the term is used for the conclusion of diverse types of transportation accidents investigated in the United States by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] or its predecessor, the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]].

==Related cases==
===In the United States===
*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', {{ussc|462|213|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lowered the threshold of probable cause by ruling that a "substantial chance" or "fair probability" of criminal activity could establish probable cause. A better-than-even chance is not required.
*The decision in ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established that "stop and frisks" (seizures)  may be made under [[reasonable suspicion]] if the officer believes a crime has been committed, is, or soon will be committed with a weapon concealed on such person.
*In ''[[United States v. Matlock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Matlock]]'', {{ussc|415|164|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court announced the "co-occupant consent rule" which permitted one resident to consent in the co-occupant's absence.  The case established that an officer who made a search with a reasonable belief that the search was consented to by a resident did not have to provide a probable cause for the search.
:However, in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', {{ussc|547|103|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled, thus replacing ''Matlock'', when officers are presented with a situation wherein two parties, each having authority to grant consent to search premises they share, but one objects over the other's consent, the officers must adhere to the wishes of the non-consenting party.

*''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', {{ussc|468|1214|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; set a special precedent for searches of students at school. The Court ruled that school officials act as state officers when conducting searches, and do not require probable cause to search students' belongings, only [[reasonable suspicion]].
*In ''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[O'Connor v. Ortega]]'', {{ussc|480|709|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court relied on ''T.L.O.'' to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to administrative searches of public employees' belongings or workplaces when conducted by supervisors seeking evidence of violations of workplace rules rather than criminal offenses.

== Probable cause hearings ==
{{See also|Evidentiary hearing}}
In the various states, a '''probable cause hearing''' is the preliminary [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] typically taking place before [[arraignment]] and before a serious crime goes to [[Trial (law)|trial]]. The [[judge]] is presented with the basis of the [[prosecution]]'s case, and the [[defendant]] is afforded full right of [[cross-examination]] and the right to be represented by [[Lawyer|legal counsel]]. If the prosecution cannot make a case of probable cause, the court must dismiss the case against the accused.

==Comparison with other countries==
===Sweden===
In the criminal code of some European countries, notably [[Sweden]], probable cause is a higher level of suspicion than "justifiable grounds" in a two level system of formal suspicion.  The latter refers only to the suspect being able to and sometimes having a motive to commit the crime and in some cases witness accounts, whereas probable cause generally requires a higher degree of physical evidence and allows for longer periods of detention before trial. See ''[[häktning]]''.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Powers of arrest without a warrant can be exercised by a constable who 'has reasonable grounds' to suspect that an individual is "about to commit an offence", or is "committing an offence"; in accordance with the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] and the partially repealed [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/110 Section 110, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24 Section 24, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "reasonable grounds for suspecting" is used throughout the law dealing with police powers.

====Scotland====
In Scotland the legal language for the provision of police powers pertaining to stopping, arresting and searching a person who "has committed or is committing an offence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/46/section/13 Section 13, Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; or in possession of an offensive article or article used in connection with an offence; is similar to as in England and Wales but is instead the powers are provided by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">The '''reveal''' (also known as the '''big reveal''') is a [[plot device]] in [[narrative structure]], and is the exposure to the reader or audience of a previously unseen key character or element of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the [[performance]].

A reveal is different from Aristotle's ''[[anagnorisis]]'', in which something is revealed to a character rather than to the audience.

==Narrative==
The reveal may result in a [[plot twist]], and could be the key plot turn or unexpected [[Post-credits scene|coda]] in the story – in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Literary genre|genre]], for example. It may also be used as a device (particularly in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]) in [[stage magic]] by an [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] or [[escape artist]].&lt;ref name=Clark_2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, James L. |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mekGtpHh5zUC&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq=%22the+reveal%22+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qgz7T-bhF4uZiAfklsmABw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20reveal%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Performing the Corkscrew |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |title=Mind Magic and Mentalism for Dummies |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage magic ==
In a magician's act, "the reveal" may refer to&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt;
* the normal culmination of a trick
* the unexpected (to the [[audience]]) culmination of the trick
* an explanation of the trick – which itself may be immediately eclipsed by a version of the trick that the first reveal can't explain.

==Film==
''Reveal'' is also used for two distinct cinematographic techniques:
* A slow, theatrically presented image of an important character or item not seen previously in the film;
* A close-up, wide shot, or other unusual camera point-of-view that shows the audience an important visual clue not known to characters in the same scene.

In the sense of first-time showing of a character, a ''reveal'' is similar to, but usually not same as, the [[opening shot]] or [[Establishing shot]] that gives the location or context of a new scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">In [[computer science]], '''run-time algorithm specialization''' is a methodology for creating efficient algorithms for costly computation tasks of certain kinds. The methodology originates in the field of [[automated theorem proving]] and, more specifically, in the [[Vampire theorem prover]] project.

The idea is inspired by the use of [[partial evaluation]] in optimising program translation. 
Many core operations in theorem provers exhibit the following pattern.
Suppose that we need to execute some algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; in a situation where a value of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is fixed for potentially many different values of'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do this efficiently, we can try to find a specialization of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; for every fixed &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., such an algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt;, that executing &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to executing &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The specialized algorithm may be more efficient than the generic one, since it can ''exploit some particular properties'' of the fixed value &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; can avoid some operations that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; would have to perform, if they are known to be redundant for this particular parameter &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
In particular, we can often identify some tests that are true or false for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, unroll loops and recursion, etc.

== Difference from partial evaluation ==
The key difference between run-time specialization and partial evaluation is that the values of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; is specialised are not known statically, so the ''specialization takes place at run-time''.

There is also an important technical difference. Partial evaluation is applied to algorithms explicitly represented as codes in some programming language. At run-time, we do not need any concrete representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt;. We only have to ''imagine'' &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; ''when we program'' the specialization procedure.
All we need is a concrete representation of the specialized version &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt;. This also means that we cannot use any universal methods for specializing algorithms, which is usually the case with partial evaluation. Instead, we have to program a specialization procedure for every particular algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt;. An important advantage of doing so is that we can use some powerful ''ad hoc'' tricks exploiting peculiarities of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; and the representation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which are beyond the reach of any universal specialization methods.

==Specialization with compilation==

The specialized algorithm has to be represented in a form that can be interpreted.
In many situations, usually when &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; is to be computed on many values &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in a row, we can write &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt; as a code of a special [[abstract machine]], and we often say that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''compiled''.  
Then the code itself can be additionally optimized by answer-preserving transformations that rely only on the semantics of instructions of the abstract machine.

Instructions of the abstract machine can usually be represented as records. One field of such a record stores an integer tag that identifies the instruction type, other fields may be used for storing additional parameters of the instruction, for example a pointer to another
instruction representing a label, if the semantics of the instruction requires a jump. All instructions of a code can be stored in an array, or list, or tree.

Interpretation is done by fetching instructions in some order, identifying their type
and executing the actions associated with this type. 
In [[C (programming language)|C]] or C++ we can use a '''switch''' statement to associate 
some actions with different instruction tags. 
Modern compilers usually compile a '''switch''' statement with integer labels from a narrow range rather efficiently by storing the address of the statement corresponding to a value &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th cell of a special array. One can exploit this
by taking values for instruction tags from a small interval of integers.

==Data-and-algorithm specialization==

There are situations when many instances of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are intended for long-term storage and the calls of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; occur with different &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in an unpredictable order.
For example, we may have to check &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_1,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; first, then &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_2,B_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_1,B_3)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.
In such circumstances, full-scale specialization with compilation may not be suitable due to excessive memory usage.  
However, we can sometimes find a compact specialized representation &lt;math&gt;A^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, that can be stored with, or instead of, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
We also define a variant &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; that works on this representation 
and any call to &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}^{\prime}(A^{\prime},B)&lt;/math&gt;, intended to do the same job faster.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
'''Social life''' is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]]. Social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability.

There are several approaches to sustainability. The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, [[economic sustainability]], and social sustainability, is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability.  The concept of "social sustainability" in this approach encompasses such topics as: [[social equity]], [[livability]], [[health equity]], [[community development]], [[social capital]], [[social support]], [[human rights]], [[labour rights]], [[placemaking]], [[social responsibility]], [[social justice]], [[cultural competence]], community resilience, and human adaptation.

A second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the "ecological domain" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See the Venn diagram and the [[Circles of Sustainability]] diagram).

==Definitions==

According to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS):&lt;ref&gt;[http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/publications/Partridgepaper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities. Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life."''

Another definition has been developed by Social Life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/ http://www.social-life.co]&lt;/ref&gt; a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place-based innovation. They define social sustainability as "''a process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve''."&lt;ref name="social-life.co"&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/media/files/DESIGN_FOR_SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY_3.pdf S.Woodcraft et al (2011) Design for Social Sustainability, Social Life, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==

Social Life have developed a framework for social sustainability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/publication/Social-Sustainability/]&lt;/ref&gt;  which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow.&lt;ref name="social-life.co"/&gt;

Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] gives the following dimensions for social sustainability:&lt;ref&gt;[http://integral-sustainability.net/wp-content/uploads/sas4-2-hodgson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Equity''' - the community provides equitable opportunities and outcomes for all its members, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community
*'''Diversity''' - the community promotes and encourages diversity
*'''Interconnected/Social cohesions''' - the community provides processes, systems and structures that promote connectedness within and outside the community at the formal, informal and institutional level
*'''Quality of life''' - the community ensures that basic needs are met and fosters a good quality of life for all members at the individual, group and community level (e.g. health, housing, education, employment, safety)
*'''Democracy and governance''' - the community provides democratic processes and open and accountable governance structures.
*'''Maturity''' - the individual accept the responsibility of consistent growth and improvement through broader social attributes (e.g. communication styles, behavioural patterns, indirect education and philosophical explorations)

Also we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, A.K. (2000) ‘The ends and means of sustainability’, keynote address at the International Conference on Transition to sustainability, Tokyo, May&lt;/ref&gt; In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, S. and Sen, A.K. (1996) ‘Sustainable human development: concepts and priorities’, Office of Development Studies Discussion Paper, No. 1, UNDP, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI). Social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by SRI funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include: community, diversity, employee relations, human rights, product safety, reporting, and governance structure.&lt;ref&gt;KLD Research. Environmental, Social and Governance Rating Criteria. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]] state that countries have the obligation to “respect, protect, and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms” and that business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable laws and respect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf|title=Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|last=United Nations Human Rights, Office of the Commissioner|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations, New York and Geneva|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both production and procurement of goods and services should be documented to verify satisfaction of these international principles and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Guiding Principles also include a reporting framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ungpreporting.org/|title=UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework|website=www.ungpreporting.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teaches companies how to report their interaction with human rights issues. In addition resources like Free2Work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free2work.org/ Free2Work]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], and [http://business-humanrights.org/ Business and Human Rights Resource Centre] all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certifications from internationally recognized and accredited organizations are available to aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (paper and forest products),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/ International Cocoa Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]] (diamonds) are examples of such organizations and initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/546/social-sustainability-initiatives-guidelines-standards|title=Social Sustainability Initiatives, Guidelines, and Standards - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge to|Diffusion of responsibility|discuss=Talk:Diffusion of responsibility#Proposed merge with Somebody else's problem|date=October 2018}}
'''Somebody else's problem''' (also known as '''someone else's problem''' or '''SEP''') is a psychological effect{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}} where people choose to dissociate themselves from an issue that may be in critical need of recognition. Such issues may be of large concern to the population as a whole but can easily be a choice of ignorance by an individual.

Author [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adams']] comedic description of the condition, which he ascribes to a physical "SEP field", has helped make it a generally recognized phenomenon.{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}} Somebody Else's Problem has been used to capture public attention on matters that may have been overlooked and has less commonly been used to identify concerns that an individual suffering symptoms of depression should ignore.{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}} This condition has also been employed as trivial shorthand to describe factors that are "out of scope" in the current context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meetings.informs.org/Conf/Miami2001//TALKS/Sponsor-25.html |title=INFORMS Miami 2001 Annual Meeting&amp;nbsp;– TB18.2 Minisum Location with Closest Euclidean Distances |accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=November 2018}}

==Origin==

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s 1982 novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' (in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Novels|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' [[comedy science fiction]] series), the character [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] says,

{{quote|An SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That’s what SEP means. Somebody Else’s Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot.}}

The narration then explains:

{{quote|The Somebody Else's Problem field... relies on people's natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else’s Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">Realised between 2002 and 2004, the project '''Sonic City''' was pioneer projects in [[locative media]], in particular the [[mobile music]] field which it contributed in establishing.

Sonic City was a form of interactive music instrument using the city as an interface. It enabled people to individually create a real-time personal soundscape of electronic music by walking through and interacting with urban environments. Paths turned into musical compositions and mobility through the shifting contexts of a city became a large scale musical gesture.

Worn on the body, Sonic City retrieved information about environmental context and user actions in real time, and mapped it to the live audio processing of urban sounds, resulting in music heard through headphones. One engaged into a musical duet with the city: urban atmospheres, nearby urban artefacts, random encounters, and everyday activities all participated in creating music as you were walking.

At the cross-road between urban exploration and experimental music making, Sonic City promoted the integration of everyday life settings and practices into personal forms of aesthetic expression with digital technology.

==Partnerships==

The Sonic City project was a collaboration between [[The Interactive Institute]] (Ramia Mazé and Margot Jacobs) and Future Applications Lab at the Viktoria Institute ([[Lalya Gaye]]), together with established Swedish sound-artist Daniel Skoglund (8Tunnel2).&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/8tunnel2&lt;/ref&gt; Lalya Gaye and Ramia Mazé initiated and managed the project. Magnus Johansson and Sara Lerén ([[University of Gothenburg]]) conducted their master's theses in the project.

Sonic City was partially funded through the Smart-Its project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smart-its.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (as part of the Disappearing Computer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.disappearing-computer.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; FET-IST research programme) and the Mobile Life project (funded by the [[Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research]]) at the Viktoria Institute. At The Interactive Institute, Sonic City was included in the Public Play Spaces research platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tii.se/projects/public-play-spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press and publication==

The project has been well-published and well-cited in academia, received a lot of attention in the new media arts scene, and has received extensive media and blog coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lyd i Byn | date=2003 | work=Harddisken, Danmarks Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Receiver 09, Vodaphone"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/09/articles/indexcenter03.html | title=Walking through Sound | date=2004 | last=Toop | first=David | work=Receiver 09, Vodaphone | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216193852/http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/09/articles/indexcenter03.html | archivedate=2004-02-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article237593.ece | title=Staden som instrument | date=2004 | last=Ryberg | first=Jonas | work=Ny Teknik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.elmundo.es/ariadna/2005/224/1109957208.html | title=Transforma el ruido de tu barrio en una sinfonía | date=2005 | last= Jiménez De Luis | first=Angel | work=El Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://we-make-money-not-art.com/interview_with_2/ | title=Interview with Lalya Gaye | date=2006 | last=Debatty | first=Régine | work=We Make Money Not Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other places, Sonic City was presented at e.g. [[NIME]] and [[Cybersonica]], and was demoed EU’s IST 2004 event in [[The Hague]] as an example of innovative European research. It was featured in the [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo Electronic Almanac]] special issue on locative media, and discussed in a number of books &lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Alex. "Worldchanging: a User's Guide for the 21st Century" (preface by Al Gore). Abrams Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, A.

The '''soul''', in many religious, philosophical, and mythological traditions, is the [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] essence of a living being.&lt;ref&gt;"soul."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 CD. 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Soul or psyche ([[Ancient Greek]]: ψυχή ''psūkhḗ'', of ψύχειν ''psū́khein'', "to breathe") are the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or [[immortality of the soul|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soul (noun) - Oxford English Dictional (online full edition)|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/185083|website=Oxford English Dictionary (OED)|publisher=Oxford English Dictional (OED)|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christianity]], only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and may have been influenced by Plato).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|title=IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130344/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] attributed "soul" (''[[wikt:anima|anima]]'') to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Eardley and Carl Still, ''Aquinas: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions (most notably [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[jiva]]) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world. [[Jainism|Jain philosophy]] is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life i.e if we see a tiger then there is a self conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of tiger which is observable) in the world. Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls. This belief is called [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052029/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html "Soul"], ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07. Retrieved 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], understood that the soul (ψυχή ''[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|psūchê]]'') must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teaching as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence (''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' 30a–b).

The current [[scientific consensus|consensus of modern science]] is that there is no evidence to support the existence of the soul when traditionally defined as the spiritual breath of the body. In [[metaphysics]], the concept of "Soul" may be equated with that of "[[Mind]]" in order to refer to the [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] of the individual.

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The Modern English word "[[:wikt:soul|soul]]", derived from [[Old English]] ''sáwol, sáwel'', was first attested in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' v. 2820 and in the [[Vespasian Psalter]] 77.50&amp;nbsp;. It is cognate with other German and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] terms for the same idea, including [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''saiwala'', [[Old High German]] ''sêula, sêla'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'', [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] ''sêla, sîla'', [[Old Norse]] ''sála'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''siela''. Deeper etymology of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word is unclear.

The original concept behind the Germanic root is thought to mean “''coming from or belonging to the sea'' (or ''lake'')”, because of the Germanic and pre-Celtic belief in souls emerging from and returning to [[Holy well|sacred lakes]], [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'' (soul) compared to [[Old Saxon]] ''sêo'' (sea).

The Koine Greek word {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]]}} (''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''), "life, spirit, consciousness", is derived from a verb meaning "to cool, to blow", and hence refers to the breath, as opposed to {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σῶμα|σῶμα]]}} (''soma''), meaning "body".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''Psychē'' occurs juxtaposed to {{lang|grc|σῶμα}}, as seen in {{Bibleverse|Matthew|10:28}}:
: Greek – {{lang|grc|καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν μὴ δυναμένων ἀποκτεῖναι· φοβεῖσθε δὲ μᾶλλον τὸν δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ.}}
: Vulgate – ''{{lang|la|et nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus animam autem non possunt occidere sed potius eum timete qui potest et animam et corpus perdere in gehennam.}}''
: Authorized King James Version (KJV) – "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

[[Paul the Apostle]] used ψυχή (''psychē'') and {{lang|grc|[[pneuma|πνεῦμα]]}} (''pneuma'') specifically to distinguish between the Jewish notions of {{lang|he|נפש}} (''nephesh'') and {{lang|he|רוח}} ''[[ruach|ruah]]'' (spirit){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (also in the Septuagint, e.g. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:2}} {{lang|he|רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים}} = {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα θεοῦ}} = ''{{lang|la|spiritus Dei}}'' = "the Spirit of God").

In the [[ancient Egyptian religion]], an individual was believed to be made up of various elements, some physical and some spiritual. Similar ideas are found in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian religion. [[Kuttamuwa]], an 8th-century BC royal official from [[Sam'al]], ordered an inscribed [[stele]] erected upon his death. The inscription requested that his mourners commemorate his life and his [[afterlife]] with feasts "for my soul that is in this stele". It is one of the earliest references to a soul as a separate entity from the body. The {{convert|800|lb|adj=on}} [[basalt]] stele is {{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|ft|abbr=on}} wide. It was uncovered in the third season of excavations by the Neubauer Expedition of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Found: An Ancient Monument to the Soul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/science/18soul.html?8dpc=&amp;_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=In a mountainous kingdom in what is now southeastern Turkey, there lived in the eighth century B.C. a royal official, Kuttamuwa, who oversaw the completion of an inscribed stone monument, or stele, to be erected upon his death.

===Bahá'í===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] affirms that "the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=158–163 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214835/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] stated that the soul not only continues to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=155–158 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104955/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually.&lt;ref name="rob1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1 |publisher= George Ronald |location= Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url= http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |accessdate= 2016-02-23 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191017/http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |archivedate= 3 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.&lt;ref name="rob1"/&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] teaches that all things are in a constant state of flux: all is changing, and no [[wikt:permanent|permanent]] state exists by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to human beings as much as to anything else in the cosmos. Thus, a human being has no permanent self.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; According to this doctrine of ''anatta'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''anātman'') – "no-self" or "no soul" – the words "I" or "me" do not refer to any fixed thing. They are simply convenient terms that allow us to refer to an ever-changing entity.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anatta'' doctrine is not a kind of [[materialism]]. Buddhism does not deny the existence of "immaterial" entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states.&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the conventional translation of ''anatta'' as "no-soul"&lt;ref&gt;for example, in Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51-66&lt;/ref&gt; can be confusing. If the word "soul" simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in [[Cartesianism]]. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no "thinker" behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"/&gt; Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new being is ''continuous'' with the being that died – in the same way that the "you" of this moment is continuous with the "you" of a moment before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist teaching holds that a notion of a permanent, abiding self is a delusion that is one of the causes of human conflict on the emotional, social, and political levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |title= A Short History of Buddhism |year=1993 |publisher= Oneworld |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; They add that an understanding of ''anatta'' provides an accurate description of the human condition, and that this understanding allows us to pacify our mundane [[desire (philosophy)|desire]]s.

Various schools of Buddhism have differing ideas about what continues after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |title=六朝神滅不滅論與佛教輪迴主體之研究 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160542/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yogacara]] school in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism said there are [[Store consciousness]] which continue to exist after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |title=佛教心理論之發達觀 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160549/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some schools, particularly [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the view is that there are three minds: ''very subtle mind'', which does not disintegrate in death; ''subtle mind'', which disintegrates in death and which is "dreaming mind" or "unconscious mind"; and ''gross mind'', which does not exist when one is ''sleeping''. Therefore, ''gross mind'' is less permanent than subtle mind, which does not exist in death. ''Very subtle mind'', however, does continue, and when it "catches on", or coincides with phenomena, again, a new ''subtle mind'' emerges, with its own personality/assumptions/habits, and ''that'' entity experiences [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] in the current continuum.

Certain modern Buddhists, particularly in [[Western world|Western countries]], reject—or at least take an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation. [[Stephen Batchelor (agnostic)|Stephen Batchelor]] discusses this in his book ''Buddhism Without Beliefs''. Others point to [[reincarnation research|research]] that has been conducted at the [[University of Virginia]] as proof that some people are reborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Alan Wallace]], ''Contemplative Science.'' University of Columbia Press, 2007, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:SoulCarriedtoHeaven.jpg|thumb|Soul carried to Heaven by [[William Bouguereau]]]]
Most Christians understand the soul as an [[ontology|ontological]] reality distinct from, yet integrally connected with, the body. Its characteristics are described in moral, spiritual, and philosophical terms. [[Richard Swinburne]], a Christian [[philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] at Oxford University, wrote that "it is a frequent criticism of substance dualism that [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] cannot say what souls are. Souls are immaterial subjects of mental properties. They have sensations and thoughts, desires and beliefs, and perform intentional actions. Souls are essential parts of human beings". According to a common [[Christian eschatology]], when people die, their souls will be [[particular judgment|judged by God]] and determined to go to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or to [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]]. Though all branches of Christianity – Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], and [[mainline Protestant]]s – teach that Jesus Christ plays a decisive role in the [[Christian salvation]] process, the specifics of that role and the part played by individual persons or [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] rituals and relationships, is a matter of wide diversity in official church teaching, theological speculation and popular practice. Some Christians believe that if one has not repented of one's sins and has not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, he/she will go to [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]] and suffer eternal [[damnation]] or eternal separation from God. Some hold a belief that babies (including the unborn) and those with cognitive or mental impairments who have died will be received into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] on the basis of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants|last=Smith|first=Joseph|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|year=1981|isbn=1592975038|location=Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America|pages=286|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians understand the soul as the life, and believe that the dead are sleeping ([[Christian conditionalism]]). This belief is traditionally accompanied by the belief that the unrighteous soul will cease to exist instead of suffering eternally ([[annihilationism]]). Believers will inherit [[eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] either in [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], or in a [[Kingdom of God]] on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.

There are also beliefs in [[universal salvation]].

====Trichotomy of the soul====
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], one of western Christianity's most influential early Christian thinkers, described the soul as "a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted to rule the body". Some Christians espouse a [[trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomic]] view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (''soma''), soul (''psyche''), and spirit (''pneuma'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |title=Soul |publisher=newadvent.org |date=1 July 1912 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128201145/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how spirit and soul are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view that each of us is body and soul. Paul said that the "body wars against" the soul, "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit" (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that "I buffet my body", to keep it under control.
Trichotomy was changed to dichotomy as tenet of Christian faith at the Council of Constantinople in 869 regarded as the 8th Ecumenical Council by Roman Catholics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Origin of the soul====
The 'origin of the soul' has provided a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include [[creationism (soul)|soul creationism]], [[traducianism]], and [[pre-existence]]. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either at the moment of conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human [[embryo]]s have souls from conception, or there is a point between conception and birth where the [[fetus]] [[ensoulment|acquires a soul]], [[consciousness]], and/or [[personhood]]. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the [[Christianity and abortion|morality of abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |title="Do Embryos Have Souls?", Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, PhD, Catholic Education Resource Center |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203818/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Matthew Syed |date=12 May 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3912708.ece |title=Embryos have souls?

====Various denominations====
The present [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defines the soul as "the innermost aspect of humans, that which is of greatest value in them, that by which they are in God's image described as 'soul' signifies the ''spiritual principle'' in man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p6.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 363 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116203545/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p6.htm |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All souls living and dead will be judged by Jesus Christ when he comes back to earth.

[[File:Dutch Church Sleepy Hollow 24.JPG|thumb|Depiction of the soul on a 17th-century tombstone at the cemetery of the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]]]]

Protestants generally believe in the soul's existence, but fall into two major camps about what this means in terms of an [[afterlife]]. Some, following [[Jean Calvin|Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Helm]], ''John Calvin's Ideas'' 2006 p129 "The Immortality of the Soul: As we saw when discussing Calvin's Christology, Calvin is a substance dualist."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and conscious existence after death, while others, following [[Martin Luther|Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, Salvatore Settis ''The Classical Tradition'' 2010 p480 "On several occasions, Luther mentioned contemptuously that the Council Fathers had decreed the soul immortal."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[mortality of the soul]] and unconscious "sleep" until the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marius ''Martin Luther: the Christian between God and death'' 1999 p429 "Luther, believing in soul sleep at death, held here that in the moment of resurrection... the righteous will rise to meet Christ in the air, the ungodly will remain on earth for judgment,..."&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[new religious movement]]s derived from Adventism—including [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith''.

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (self, essence) in every being, a major point of difference with [[Buddhism]], which does not believe that there is either soul or self.&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought).

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], a ''jiva'' ({{lang-sa|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīva}}, alternative spelling ''jiwa''; {{lang-hi|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīv}}, alternative spelling ''jeev'') is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Hall|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqzkqnETEVYC|year=2011|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3430-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, ''jiva'' is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii/&gt; The concept of ''Ajiva'' in Jainism means "not soul", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii&gt;{{cite book|author=J Jaini|title=Outlines Of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, a ''Jiva'' is either ''samsari'' (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or ''mukta'' (liberated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN82XwAACAAJ|title=Gommatsara Jiva-kanda|first1=Jagmandar-lāl|last1=Jaini|archive-url=https://archive.org/download/sacredbooksofthe029558mbp|archive-date=2006|year=1927|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|title=Buddhism and Jainism|last=|first=|date=2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789402408515|editor-last=Sarao|editor-first=K.

The concept of ''jiva'' in Jainism is similar to ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with ''jiva'' considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=varenne46&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Varenne|title=Yoga and the Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUWxDDqzuAC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0543-9|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Myers|title=Brahman: A Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfvaAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83565-0|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hiranyagarba&amp;ei=gCnrSaGyLZLQMu3AmaQB ''The Philosophy of Person: Solidarity and Cultural Creativity'', Jozef Tichner and George McClean, 1994, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes referred to as ''jiva-atman'' (a soul in a living body).&lt;ref name=varenne46/&gt;
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], the soul is an eternal point of light.

===Islam===
{{Main|Rūḥ|Nafs}}
The [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], distinguishes between the immortal ''[[rūḥ]]'' (spirit or "soul") and the mortal ''[[nafs]]'' (psyche).&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Deuraseh |first1 = Nurdeen |last2 = Abu Talib |first2 = Mansor |year = 2005 |title = Mental health in Islamic medical tradition |url = |journal = The International Medical Journal |volume = 4 |issue = 2 |pages = 76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immortal rūḥ "drives" the mortal nafs, which comprises temporal desires and perceptions necessary for living.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Sultan |title=Islam In Perspective |chapter=''Nafs:'' What Is it? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxT_3zlWc-UC&amp;pg=PA180 |edition=revised |publisher=Author House |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4490-3993-6 |page=180 |via=Google Books |access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the passages in the Quran that mention ''rûh'' occur in chapters 17 ("The Night Journey") and 39 ("The Throngs"):
{{quote|And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the spirit [''rûh'']. Say, "The spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little.|Quran 17:85}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
{{Further|Jain philosophy|Jainism and non-creationism}}
In Jainism, every living being, from plant or bacterium to human, has a soul and the concept forms the very basis of Jainism. According to Jainism, there is no beginning or end to the existence of soul. It is eternal in nature and changes its form until it attains liberation.

The soul ''([[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]])'' is basically categorized in one of two ways based on its present state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
# Liberated Souls – These are souls which have attained liberation (''[[moksha]]'') and never become part of the life cycle again.
# Non-Liberated Souls – The souls of any living being which are stuck in the life cycle of 4 forms; ''Manushya Gati'' (Human Being), ''Tiryanch Gati'' (Any other living being), ''Dev Gati'' (Heaven) and ''Narak Gati'' (Hell).

Until the time the soul is liberated from the ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (cycle of repeated birth and death), it gets attached to one of these bodies based on the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state the soul is in, it has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of ''[[siddha]]'' (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.

Concerning the Jain view of the soul, [[Virchand Gandhi]] said
{{quote|the soul lives its own life, not for the purpose of the body, but the body lives for the purpose of the soul. If we believe that the soul is to be controlled by the body then soul misses its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forgotten Gandhi, Virchand Gandhi (1864-1901) - Advocate of Universal Brotherhood |url=http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |publisher=All Famous Quotes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921112719/http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |archivedate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism===
{{Primary sources|date=April 2018}}
The [[Hebrew]] terms {{Hebrew|נפש}} ''[[nephesh|nefesh]]'' (literally "living being"), {{Hebrew|רוח}} ''[[ruach]]'' (literally "wind"), {{Hebrew|נשמה}} ''neshamah'' (literally "breath"), {{Hebrew|חיה}} ''chayah'' (literally "life") and {{Hebrew|יחידה}} ''yechidah'' (literally "singularity") are used to describe the soul or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Zohar'', ''Rayah Mehemna'', ''Terumah'' 158b.  See Leibowitz, Aryeh (2018). ''The Neshamah: A Study of the Human Soul''. Feldheim Publishers. Pages 27 and 110. {{ISBN|1680253387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]] the soul was believed to be given by God to Adam as mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], {{quote|Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.|{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|JPR}}}}

Judaism relates the quality of one's soul to one's performance of the commandments (''[[mitzvot]])'' and reaching higher levels of understanding, and thus closeness to God. A person with such closeness is called a ''[[tzadik]]''. Therefore, Judaism embraces the commemoration of the day of one's death, ''[[Yartzeit|nahala]]''/''Yahrtzeit'' and not the [[birthday]]&lt;ref&gt;The only person mentioned in the [[Torah]] celebrating birthday (party) is the wicked [[pharaoh]] of Egypt {{Bibleverse|Genesis|40:20-22|JPR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a festivity of remembrance, for only toward the end of life's struggles, tests and challenges could human souls be judged and credited for righteousness.&lt;ref name="rebchaim birthday"&gt;{{cite web|last=HaQoton|first=Reb Chaim|title=Happy Birthday|url=http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|publisher=Reb Chaim HaQoton|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001613/http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aish birthday"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jewish Birthdays|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|work=Judaism 101|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822100333/http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism places great importance on the study of the souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|title=SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035611/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kabbalah]] and other mystic traditions go into greater detail into the nature of the soul. Kabbalah separates the soul into five elements, corresponding to the [[five worlds]]:

# [[Nephesh|Nefesh]], related to natural instinct.
# [[Ruach]], related to emotion and morality.
# Neshamah, related to intellect and the awareness of God.
# Chayah, considered a part of God, as it were.
# [[Yechidah]].  This aspect is essentially one with God.

Kabbalah also proposed a concept of reincarnation, the ''[[gilgul]]''. (See also ''[[nefesh habehamit]]'' the "animal soul".)

===Scientology===
The [[Scientology]] view is that a person does not have a soul, it is a soul. A person is immortal, and may be reincarnated if they wish. The Scientology term for the soul is "[[thetan]]", derived from the Greek word "theta", symbolizing thought. Scientology counselling (called [[auditing]]) addresses the soul to improve abilities, both worldly and spiritual.

===Shamanism===
According to Nadya Yuguseva, a shaman from the Altai, "A woman has 40 souls; men have just one".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhism]] considers soul (''atma'') to be part of God ([[Waheguru]]). Various hymns are cited from the holy book [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (SGGS) that suggests this belief. "God is in the Soul and the Soul is in the God."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1153.&lt;/ref&gt; The same concept is repeated at various pages of the SGGS. For example: "The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 4, p 1325.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1030.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''atma'' or soul according to Sikhism is an entity or "spiritual spark" or "light" in our body because of which the body can sustain life. On the departure of this entity from the body, the body becomes lifeless – No amount of manipulations to the body can make the person make any physical actions. The soul is the ‘driver’ in the body. It is the ''roohu'' or spirit or ''atma'', the presence of which makes the physical body alive.

Many religious and philosophical traditions support the view that the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.

===Taoism===
According to Chinese traditions, every person has two types of soul called [[hun and po]] (魂 and 魄), which are respectively [[yin and yang|yang and yin]]. [[Taoism]] believes in ten souls, ''sanhunqipo'' ([[:zh:三魂七魄|三魂七魄]]) "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying (2008) |publisher=Deathreference.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105103959/http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pò is linked to the dead body and the grave, whereas the hún is linked to the ancestral tablet. A living being that loses any of them is said to have mental illness or [[unconsciousness]], while a dead soul may [[reincarnate]] to a [[disability]], lower [[desire realm]]s, or may even be unable to reincarnate.

&lt;!-- {{Main|Salvation|Soul sleep}} No, [[Salvation]] and [[Soul sleep]] are not the "main articles" for "Life and death", as this former article section has been called. Any connections between these terms should be made explicit in the text. At the very least, [[Template:Seealso]] would be more appropriate than [[Template:Main]]. --&gt;
In theological reference to the soul, the terms "life" and "death" are viewed as emphatically more definitive than the common concepts of "[[life|biological life]]" and "biological death". Because the soul is said to be transcendent of the ''[[matter|material]] existence,'' and is said to have (potentially) [[immortality|eternal life]], the death of the soul is likewise said to be an ''eternal death''. Thus, in the concept of [[divine judgment]], God is commonly said to have options with regard to the dispensation of souls, ranging from [[Heaven]] (i.e., [[angel]]s) to [[hell]] (i.e., [[demon]]s), with various concepts in between. Typically both Heaven and hell are said to be eternal, or at least far beyond a typical human concept of [[life expectancy|lifespan]] and time.

According to [[Louis Ginzberg]], soul of [[Adam]] is the image of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

===Spirituality, New Age, and new religions===

====Brahma Kumaris====
In [[Brahma Kumaris]], human souls are believed to be incorporeal and [[eternity|eternal]]. God is considered to be the Supreme Soul, with maximum degrees of spiritual qualities, such as peace, love and purity.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Possession"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
In [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the soul is the field of our psychological activity (thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and so on) as well as of the so-called paranormal or [[psychic]] phenomena (extrasensory perception, out-of-body experiences, etc.). However, the soul is not the highest, but a middle dimension of human beings. Higher than the soul is the spirit, which is considered to be the real self; the source of everything we call "good"—happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, etc. While the spirit is eternal and incorruptible, the soul is not. The soul acts as a link between the material body and the spiritual self, and therefore shares some characteristics of both. The soul can be attracted either towards the spiritual or towards the material realm, being thus the "battlefield" of good and evil. It is only when the soul is attracted towards the spiritual and merges with the Self that it becomes eternal and divine.

====Anthroposophy====
[[Rudolf Steiner]] differentiated three stages of soul development, which interpenetrate one another in consciousness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creeger|first=Rudolf Steiner; translated by Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: an introduction to the spiritual processes in human life and in the cosmos|year=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, NY|isbn=0-88010-373-6|pages=42–46|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "sentient soul", centering on sensations, drives, and passions, with strong [[conation|conative]] (will) and emotional components;
*The "intellectual" or "mind soul", internalizing and reflecting on outer experience, with strong affective (feeling) and cognitive (thinking) components; and
*The "consciousness soul", in search of universal, objective truths.

====Miscellaneous====
In [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]], the soul is considered to be an exact replica and spark of the Divine. The purpose of Surat Shabd Yoga is to realize one's True Self as soul (Self-Realisation), True Essence (Spirit-Realisation) and True Divinity (God-Realisation) while living in the physical body.

Similarly, the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that "Atma, or the soul, is in reality identical with Paramatma the Oversoul — which is one, infinite, and eternal...[and] [t]he sole purpose of creation is for the soul to enjoy the infinite state of the Oversoul consciously."&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Meher. (1987). ''Discourses.'' Myrtle Beach, SC: Sheriar Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used the word "[[Ensoulment|ensouled]]" to represent the concept of being "alive", indicating that the earliest surviving [[western philosophy|western philosophical]] view believed that the soul was that which gave the body life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/ancient-soul/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lorenz|first=Hendrik|date=2009|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul was considered the incorporeal or spiritual "breath" that animates (from the Latin, ''[[:wikt:anima|anima]]'', cf. "animal") the living organism.

[[F. M. Cornford|Francis M. Cornford]] quotes [[Pindar]] by saying that the soul sleeps while the limbs are active, but when one is sleeping, the soul is active and reveals "an award of joy or sorrow drawing near" in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Cornford, ''Greek Religious Thought'', p.64, referring to Pindar, Fragment 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erwin Rohde]] writes that an early pre-[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] belief presented the soul as lifeless when it departed the body, and that it retired into [[Hades]] with no hope of returning to a body.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Rohde, ''Psyche'', 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socrates and Plato&lt;!--Linked from 'Emanationism'--&gt;===

{{Main|Plato's tripartite theory of soul}}
Drawing on the words of his teacher Socrates, Plato considered the psyche to be the [[essence]] of a person, being that which decides how we behave. He considered this essence to be an incorporeal, eternal occupant of our being. Plato says that even after death, the soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is continually reborn in subsequent bodies. However, Aristotle believed that only one part of the soul was immortal namely the intellect (''[[Logos#Ancient Greek philosophy|logos]]''). The Platonic soul consists of three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Gift of Logos: Essays in Continental Philosophy|last = Jones|first = David|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1RgaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=plato+soul+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL-or46rPJAhVU_mMKHUQ-C48Q6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=plato%20soul%20logos&amp;f=false|accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ''logos'', or ''logistikon'' (mind, [[nous]], or [[reason]])
# the ''[[Thumos|thymos]]'', or ''thumetikon'' ([[emotion]], spiritedness, or masculine)
# the ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'', or ''epithumetikon'' (appetitive, [[motivation|desire]], or feminine)

The parts are located in different regions of the body:
# ''logos'' is located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other part.
# ''thymos'' is located near the chest region and is related to anger.
# ''eros'' is located in the stomach and is related to one's desires.

Plato also compares the three parts of the soul or psyche to a societal [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|caste system]]. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul is essentially the same thing as a state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The structure of the souls of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]], with ''Bios'', ''Zoê'', and ''Psūchê'']]
Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) defined the soul, or ''Psūchê'' (ψυχή), as the "[[first actuality]]" of a naturally organized body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=On The Soul|pages=412b5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against its separate existence from the physical body. In Aristotle's view, the primary activity, or full actualization, of a living thing constitutes its soul. For example, the full actualization of an eye, as an independent organism, is to see (its purpose or [[final cause]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book VIII, Chapter 5, pages 256a5-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is that the full actualization of a human being would be living a fully functional human life in accordance with reason (which he considered to be a faculty unique to humanity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics |at=Book I, Chapter 7, pages 1098a7-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, the soul is the organization of the form and matter of a natural being which allows it to strive for its full actualization. This organization between form and matter is necessary for any activity, or functionality, to be possible in a natural being. Using an artifact (non-natural being) as an example, a house is a building for human habituation, but for a house to be actualized requires the material (wood, nails, bricks, etc.) necessary for its actuality (i.e. being a fully functional house). However, this does not imply that a house has a soul. In regards to artifacts, the source of motion that is required for their full actualization is outside of themselves (for example, a builder builds a house). In natural beings, this source of motion is contained within the being itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book III, Chapter 1, pages 201a10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle elaborates on this point when he addresses the faculties of the soul.

The various [[faculties of the soul]], such as nutrition, movement (peculiar to animals), reason (peculiar to humans), sensation (special, common, and incidental) and so forth, when exercised, constitute the "second" actuality, or fulfillment, of the capacity to be alive. For example, someone who falls asleep, as opposed to someone who falls dead, can wake up and live their life, while the latter can no longer do so.

Aristotle identified three hierarchical levels of natural beings: plants, animals, and people, having three different degrees of soul: ''Bios'' (life), ''Zoë'' (animate life), and ''Psuchë'' (self-conscious life). For these groups, he identified three corresponding levels of soul, or biological activity: the nutritive activity of growth, sustenance and reproduction which all life shares (''Bios''); the self-willed motive activity and sensory faculties, which only animals and people have in common (''Zoë''); and finally "reason", of which people alone are capable (''Pseuchë'').

Aristotle's discussion of the soul is in his work, ''De Anima'' (''[[On the Soul]]''). Although mostly seen as opposing Plato in regard to the immortality of the soul, a controversy can be found in relation to the fifth chapter of the third book: In this text both interpretations can be argued for, soul as a whole can be deemed mortal, and a part called "active intellect" or "active mind" is immortal and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=On The Soul |at=Book III, Chapter 5, pages 430a24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates exist for both sides of the controversy, but it has been understood that there will be permanent disagreement about its final conclusions, as no other [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] text contains this specific point, and this part of ''De Anima'' is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/active-mind.html |title=Aristotle's Psychology |chapter=supplement: The Active Mind of De Anima iii 5) |accessdate=2013-12-12 |author=Shields, Christopher |year=2011 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aristotle states that the soul helps humans find the truth and understanding the true purpose or role of the soul is extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{dite book |title=Introduction to Aristotle |last=Smith |first=J. S. (Trans) |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |location=Chicago |pages=155–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
Following Aristotle, [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], a [[list of Persian philosophers|Persian philosopher]], further elaborated upon the Aristotelian understanding of the soul and developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul include the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of "The Ten Intellects", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final [[intelligence|intellect]].

While he was imprisoned, Avicenna wrote his famous "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantial nature of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|title=Floating Man - The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia|website=www.artandpopularculture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426075928/http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no [[sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that in this scenario one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]]. This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemology|epistemic]] terms, when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the [[heart]], whereas Ibn al-Nafis rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul "is related to the entirety and not to one or a few [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s". He further criticized Aristotle's idea whereby every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. al-Nafis concluded that "the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul," and he defined the soul as nothing other than "what a human indicates by saying "[[I (pronoun)|I]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nahyan A. G. Fancy|year=2006|title=Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)"|pages=209–210|work=Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]]|url=http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404020329/http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615/|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
Following Aristotle (whom he referred to as "the Philosopher") and Avicenna, [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–74) understood the soul to be the first actuality of the living body. Consequent to this, he distinguished three orders of life: plants, which feed and grow; animals, which add sensation to the operations of plants; and humans, which add intellect to the operations of animals.

Concerning the human soul, his epistemological theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, the soul is definitely not corporeal—if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that thing would come to be within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023626/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Super Boetium De Trinitate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110654/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full argument for the [[immortality of the soul]] and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the [[Summa Theologica]].

===Immanuel Kant===
In his discussions of rational psychology, [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) identified the soul as the "I" in the strictest sense, and argued that the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.
{{quote|We cannot prove a priori the immateriality of the soul, but rather only so much: that all properties and actions of the soul cannot be recognized from materiality.}} It is from the "I", or soul, that Kant proposes transcendental rationalization, but cautions that such rationalization can only determine the limits of knowledge if it is to remain practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Philosophy of mind===
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}
[[Gilbert Ryle]]'s [[ghost in the machine]] argument, which is a rejection of Descartes' [[mind–body dualism]], can provide a contemporary understanding of the soul/mind, and the problem concerning its connection to the brain/body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryles|first=Gilbert|title=The Concept of Mind|year=1949|publisher=University Of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Hillman===
Psychologist James Hillman's [[archetypal psychology]] is an attempt to restore the concept of the soul, which Hillman viewed as the "self-sustaining and imagining substrate" upon which consciousness rests. Hillman described the soul as that "which makes meaning possible, [deepens] events into experiences, is communicated in love, and has a religious concern", as well as "a special relation with death".&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=21 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from the Cartesian [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] "between outer tangible reality and inner states of mind", Hillman takes the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] stance&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=112 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a "third, middle position" in which soul resides.&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=121 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archetypal psychology acknowledges this third position by attuning to, and often accepting, the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], [[dream]]s, [[mythology|myths]], and even [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] through which, in Hillman's view, soul expresses itself.

==Science==
The current [[scientific consensus]] across all fields is that the existence of any kind of soul in the traditional sense is incompatible with a modern scientific understanding of the human mind, which holds that the human being is merely a complex machine that operates based on the exact same physical laws as all other objects in the universe, according to Julien Musolino, a cognitive scientist and professor at [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Musolino|first=Julien|date=2015|title=The Soul Fallacy: What Science Shows We Gain from Letting Go of Our Soul Beliefs|location=Amherst, New York|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-962-8|pages=21–38|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who states that there is currently no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the existence of the soul&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt; and there is considerable evidence that seems to indicate that souls do not exist.&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt;

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscience]] as an [[interdisciplinary]] field, and its branch of [[cognitive neuroscience]] particularly, operates under the [[ontology|ontological]] assumption of [[physicalism]]. In other words, it assumes—in order to perform its science—that only the fundamental phenomena studied by [[physics]] exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena within the framework according to which human [[thought]] and [[behavior]] are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of [[reductionism]] by seeking an explanation for the mind in terms of brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;O. Carter Snead. "[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/12/28%20neuroscience%20snead/1228_neuroscience_snead.pdf Cognitive Neuroscience and the Future of Punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105165031/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/12/28%20neuroscience%20snead/1228_neuroscience_snead.pdf |date=5 November 2014 }}" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ.

To study the mind in terms of the brain several methods of [[functional neuroimaging]] are used to study the neuroanatomical correlates of various [[cognition|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind. The evidence from brain imaging indicates that all processes of the mind have physical correlates in brain function.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Eugenio Cavanna, Andrea Nani, Hal Blumenfeld, Steven Laureys. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Neuroimaging_of_Consciousness.html?id=YQZomQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Neuroimaging of Consciousness]" (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, such correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of these cognitive processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]], and of necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit experimental manipulation of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes consciousness, then a causal role for that brain activity can be inferred.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426214509/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|archivedate=26 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

In a loss-of-function (also called "necessity") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called "sufficiency") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Carter, Jennifer C.

===Physics===
Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] has written that the idea of a soul is incompatible with [[quantum field theory]] (QFT). He writes that for a soul to exist: "Not only is new physics required, but dramatically new physics. Within QFT, there can't be a new collection of 'spirit particles' and 'spirit forces' that interact with our regular atoms, because we would have detected them in existing experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, Sean M.]]. (2011). [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ "Physics and the Immortality of the Soul"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006180135/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ |date=6 October 2011 }}. ''[[Scientific American]]''. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantum indeterminacy|Quantum indeterminism]] has been invoked by some theorists as a solution to the problem of how a soul might interact with the brain, but neuroscientist Peter Clarke found errors with this viewpoint, noting there is no evidence that such processes play a role in brain function; and concluded that a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] soul has no basis from quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter. (2014). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 ''Neuroscience, Quantum Indeterminism and the Cartesian Soul''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910221027/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 |date=10 September 2017 }}.

==Parapsychology==
Some [[parapsychologists]] have attempted to establish, by [[scientific]] experiment, whether a soul separate from the brain exists, as is more commonly defined in religion rather than as a synonym of psyche or mind. [[Milbourne Christopher]] (1979) and [[Mary Roach]] (2010) have argued that none of the attempts by parapsychologists have yet succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979).

In 1901 [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] conducted [[21 grams experiment|an experiment]] in which he made weight measurements of patients as they died.

[[File:Pig swill auction poster.jpg|thumb|200px|Poster for pig swill for auction sale, London, 1877]]
'''Swill''' is food for animals in liquid or partly liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swill?s=t|title=the definition of swill|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used as an extremely derogatory label for any drink meant for human ingestion perceived as unpalatable or nearly so. 

==Pig swill==
'''Pig swill''', '''hog swill''', '''hogwash''' is kitchen refuse used to feed [[pig]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hogwash?s=t|title=the definition of hogwash|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically pig farmers arranged collection of swill, e.g. by means of '''swill bins'''. The grease was skimmed off the swill tanks and sold for further processing, while the remaining swill was processed into pig food.

During [[World War II]] collection of pig swill was a nationwide campaign in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1900s.org.uk/1940s50s-pig-food-collection.htm|title=Food scraps and pig swill: how Britain coped in and after WW2|website=www.1900s.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak]] it was thought that unprocessed pig swill was a key link in the chain of the infection, and it was banned in Great Britain. In 2003 the ban was expanded to the whole [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23769171 Should pig swill from waste food be back on the menu?], BBC, 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now significant research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/feeding-food-waste-to-pigs-could-save-vast-swathes-of-threatened-forest-and-savannah|title=Feeding food waste to pigs could save vast swathes of threatened forest and savannah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support from farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/farmers-back-reintroduction-on-swill-as-pig-feed-poll-finds.htm|title=Farmer back introduction of swill as pig feed, poll feeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a return to feeding swill to pigs, not only as a way to reduce pig feed costs but also to reduce demands on agricultural land for pig feed.

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''tensor decomposition''' is any scheme for expressing a [[tensor]] as a sequence of elementary operations acting on other, often simpler tensors. Many tensor decompositions generalize some [[matrix decomposition]]s.

The main tensor decompositions are:
* [[tensor rank decomposition]];
* [[higher-order singular value decomposition]];
* [[Tucker decomposition]];
* [[matrix product state]]s, or tensor trains;
* [[hierarchical Tucker decomposition]]; and
* [[block term decomposition]].

'''The Moscow rules''' are [[Rule of thumb|rules-of-thumb]] said to have been developed during the [[Cold War]] to be used by spies and others working in Moscow.

The rules are associated with Moscow because the city developed a reputation as being a particularly harsh locale for clandestine operatives who were exposed. The list may never have existed as written.

== The rules ==
Agent [[Tony Mendez]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although no one had written them down, they were the precepts we all understood for conducting operations in the most difficult of operating environments: the Soviet capital. By the time they got to Moscow, everyone knew these rules. They were dead simple and full of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spy Dust: Two Masters of Disguise Reveal the Tools and Operations that Helped Win the Cold War|last=Mendez|first=Antonio|last2=Mendez|first2=Jonna|last3=Henderson|first3=Bruce|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2003|isbn=9780743434584|location=New York|page=36|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[International Spy Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Moscow Rules are given as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=The Spy Museum |url=https://www.spymuseum.org/exhibition-experiences/online-exhibits/argo-exposed/moscow-rules/ |title=Moscow Rules |access-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Assume nothing. 
# Never go against your gut.
# Everyone is potentially under opposition control.
# Do not look back; you are never completely alone.
# Go with the flow, blend in.
# Vary your pattern and stay within your cover.
# Lull them into a sense of complacency.
# Do not harass the opposition.
# Pick the time and place for action.
# Keep your options open.

== Fictional references ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Other rules which have been circulated around the Internet and used in fiction include:

* [[Murphy's Law|Murphy]] is right. (i.e., "What can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible moment.")
* Any operation can be aborted. If it feels wrong, it is wrong.
* Maintain a natural pace.
* Build in opportunity, but use it sparingly.
* Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. (Borrowed from [[Muhammad Ali]].)
* There is no limit to a human being's ability to rationalize the truth.
* Technology will always let you down.
* Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is an enemy action. (Taken from [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']])
* Do not attract attention, even by being overly careful.

Moscow rules are prominently referenced in [[John le Carré]]'s cold war books including ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]'' and ''[[Smiley's People]]'', as [[tradecraft]], including use of inconspicuous signal markers (drawing pins, chalk marks), the use of [[dead drop]]s, and the ways to signal the need for a (rare) face-to-face meeting. Moscow Rules are important at the beginning of ''Smiley's People,'' where the General invokes the rules to request a meeting with Smiley, but he is followed and killed by [[KGB]] assassins before it can happen.  The applicable rule states that no documents may be carried that cannot be instantly discarded, in this instance a 35mm negative concealed in an empty pack of cigarettes.

In ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' there are references to the Moscow Rules. In particular, in Season 6 Episode 10, [[Harry Pearce]] tells someone, "Treat London as enemy territory, keep your head down, find an opportunity, and make a move." In an earlier episode in Season 5, rogue MI6 agent Richard Dempsey is said to be in disguise and following the Moscow Rules, where the idea of treating the place as enemy territory is repeated.

In ''[[The Middleman (TV series)|The Middleman]]'', episode 8 (the "Ectoplasmic Pan-Hellenic Investigation"), the Moscow Rules are recited.

[[File:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb|300px|Reservation lands in the Continental United States]]
'''Tribal sovereignty in the United States''' is the concept of the inherent authority of [[Indian tribes in the United States|indigenous tribes]] to govern themselves within the borders of the United States. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] recognizes tribal nations as "domestic dependent nations" and has established a number of laws attempting to clarify the relationship between the federal, state, and tribal governments.

==Native American sovereignty and the Constitution==

The [[United States Constitution]] mentions Native American tribes three times:

* Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 states that "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States ... excluding Indians not taxed."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Article I|Constitution of the United States of America: Article. I.]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|Story's ''Commentaries on the U.S. Constitution'']], "There were Indians, also, in several, and probably in most, of the states at that period, who were not treated as citizens, and yet, who did not form a part of independent communities or tribes, exercising general sovereignty and powers of government within the boundaries of the states."
* Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes",&lt;ref name=Policy-Center&gt;American Indian Policy Center. 2005. St. Paul, MN. 4 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; determining that Indian tribes were separate from the federal government, the states, and foreign nations;&lt;ref&gt;''Cherokee Nation v. Georgia''&lt;/ref&gt; and
* The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 amends the apportionment of representatives in Article I, Section 2 above.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Additional amendments to the United States Constitution|Additional amendments to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These basic provisions have been changed or clarified by various federal laws over the history of the United States. ''Regulate'' historically meant ''facilitate'', rather than control or direct in the more modern sense. Therefore, the Congress of these United States was to be the facilitator of commerce between the states and the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, ''regulate'' meant that Congress should in principle assist with Commerce disputes between the States, but did not grant Congress the power of law to inflict criminal penalties,  [http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/kentucky-resolutions-of-1798/ Article 2 of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798] by Thomas Jefferson&lt;/ref&gt;

These Constitutional provisions, and subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court (see below), are today often summarized in three principles of U.S. Indian law:&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Wilkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IHKXAAAAMAAJ Indian tribes as sovereign governments: a sourcebook on federal-tribal history, law, and policy], AIRI Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deskbook&gt;Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook, University Press of Colorado, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Bruce Duthu, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8u0UstccznkC American Indians and the Law], Penguin/Viking, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Territorial sovereignty''': Tribal authority on Indian land is organic and is not granted by the states in which Indian lands are located.
* '''Plenary power doctrine''': Congress, and not the [[United States Executive Branch|Executive Branch]] or [[United States Judicial Branch|Judicial Branch]], has ultimate authority with regard to matters affecting the Indian tribes. Federal courts give greater deference to Congress on Indian matters than on other subjects.
* '''Trust relationship''': The federal government has a "duty to protect" the tribes, implying (courts have found) the necessary legislative and executive authorities to effect that duty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

===The Marshall Trilogy, 1823–1832===
[[File:Hassanamisco Nipmuc Indian Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|Hassanamisco Nipmuc Indian Reservation Sign]]
The Marshall Trilogy is a set of three Supreme Court decisions in the early nineteenth century affirming the legal and political standing of Indian nations.

* ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' (1823), holding that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans.
* ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' (1831), holding the Cherokee nation dependent, with a relationship to the United States like that of a "ward to its guardian".
* ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments, stating that the federal government was the sole authority to deal with Indian nations.

===Indian Appropriations Act of 1871===

The [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871 Act|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] had two significant sections. First, the Act ended United States recognition of additional Native American tribes or independent nations, and prohibited additional treaties. Thus it required the federal government no longer interact with the various tribes through treaties, but rather through statutes:

{{quote|That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe.|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871&lt;ref name="App_act"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.onecle.com/constitution/article-2/21-indian-treaties.html |title=Indian Treaties |accessdate=2009-03-31 |author=Onecle |date=November 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="25 usc 71"&gt;25 U.S.C. § 71. Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 544, 566&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before 1871, the United States had recognized the Indian Tribes as semi-independent.

The 1871 Act also made it a federal crime to commit murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny within any Territory of the United States.

===''United States v. Kagama'' (1886)===
The 1871 Act was affirmed in 1886 by the US Supreme Court, in ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'', which affirmed that the Congress has [[plenary power]] over all Native American tribes within its borders by rationalization that "The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=118&amp;invol=375 |title=''U.S. v Kagama'', 118 U.S. 375 (1886), Filed May 10, 1886 |publisher=FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business |accessdate=2012-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court affirmed that the US Government "has the right and authority, instead of controlling them by treaties, to govern them by acts of Congress, they being within the geographical limit of the United States. ... The Indians owe no allegiance to a State within which their reservation may be established, and the State gives them no protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/375/ |title=''United States v. Kagama'' – 118 U.S. 375 (1886) |publisher=Justia |accessdate=2012-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment of tribal courts, 1883===
{{also|United States Indian Police}}
On April 10, 1883, five years after establishing Indian police powers throughout the various reservations, the Indian Commissioner approved rules for a "court of Indian offenses". The court provided a venue for prosecuting criminal charges, but afforded no relief for tribes seeking to resolve civil matters. The new courts' rules specifically targeted tribal religious practices which it called "heathenish rites" and the commissioner urged courts to "destroy the tribal relations as fast as possible". Another five years later, Congress began providing funds to operate the Indian courts.

While U.S. courts clarified some of the rights and responsibilities of states and the federal government toward the Indian nations within the new nation's first century, it was almost another century before United States courts determined what powers remained vested in the tribal nations. In the interim, as a trustee charged with protecting their interests and property, the federal government was legally entrusted with ownership and administration of the assets, land, water, and treaty rights of the tribal nations.

===The General Allotment Act (Dawes Act), 1887===
{{Main|Dawes Act}}
Passed by Congress in 1887, the "Dawes Act" was named for Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts, Chairman of the Senate's Indian Affairs Committee. It came as another crucial step in attacking the tribal aspect of the Indians of the time. In essence, the act broke up the land of most all tribes into modest parcels to be distributed to Indian families, and those remaining were auctioned off to white purchasers. Indians who accepted the farmland and became "civilized" were made American citizens. But the Act itself proved disastrous for Indians, as much tribal land was lost and cultural traditions destroyed. Whites benefited the most; for example, when the government made {{convert|2|e6acre|km2}} of Indian lands available in Oklahoma, 50,000 white settlers poured in almost instantly to claim it all (in a period of one day, April 22, 1889).

==Twentieth-century developments==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2009}}

===Revenue and Indian Citizenship acts, 1924===
The ''[[Revenue Act of 1924]]'' ({{USStat|43|253}}) (June 2, 1924), also known as the ''Mellon tax bill'', cut [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] [[tax]] rates and established the [[U.S. Board of Tax Appeals]], which was later renamed the [[United States Tax Court]] in 1942. The bill was named after [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Andrew Mellon]]. The Revenue Act was applicable to incomes for 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/61/item/20394?start_page=44|title=Statistics of Income, 1926 - FRASER - St. Louis Fed|website=fraser.stlouisfed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom rate, on income under $4,000, fell from 1.5% to 1.125% (both rates are after reduction by the "[[earned income credit]]"). A parallel act, the ''[[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]]'' ({{USStat|43|253}}, Ch. 233 (1924)), granted all non-citizen resident Indians citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0146.html |title=The 1924 Indian Citizenship Act |publisher=Nebraskastudies.org |date=1924-06-02 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oklahoma State University Library |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol4/html_files/v4p1165.html |title=Indian Affairs: Laws And Treaties. Vol. Iv, Laws |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Revenue Act declared that there were no longer any "Indians, not taxed" to be not counted for purposes of [[United States Congressional apportionment]]. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the bill into law.

In ''[[Iron Crow v. Oglala Sioux Tribe]]'', the United States Supreme Court concluded that two [[Oglala Sioux]] defendants convicted of adultery under tribal laws, and another challenging a tax from the tribe, were not exempted from the tribal justice system because they had been granted U.S. citizenship. It found that tribes "still possess their inherent sovereignty excepting only when it has been specifically taken from them by treaty or Congressional Act". This means American Indians do not have exactly the same rights of citizenship as other American citizens. The court cited case law from a pre-1924 case that said, "when Indians are prepared to exercise the privileges and bear the burdens of" ''[[sui iuris]]'', i.e. of one's own right and not under the power of someone else, "the tribal relation may be dissolved and the national guardianship brought to an end, but it rests with Congress to determine when and how this shall be done, and whether the emancipation shall be complete or only partial" (''U.S. v. Nice'', 1916). The court further determined, based on the earlier ''Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock'' case, that "It is thoroughly established that Congress has [[plenary authority]] over Indians." The court held that, "the granting of citizenship in itself did not destroy ... jurisdiction of the Indian tribal courts and ... there was no intention on the part of Congress to do so." The adultery conviction and the power of tribal courts were upheld.

===Indian Reorganization Act, 1934===
In 1934 the ''[[Indian Reorganization Act]]'', codified as Title 25, Section 476 of the U.S. Code, allowed Indian nations to select from a catalogue of constitutional documents that enumerated powers for tribes and for [[Tribal Council|tribal councils]]. Though the Act did not specifically recognize the Courts of Indian Offenses, 1934 is widely considered to be the year when tribal authority, rather than United States authority, gave the tribal courts legitimacy.

In 1956, a U.S. Court concluded no law had ever established tribal courts, but nonetheless, decades of federal funding implied that they were legitimate courts. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Public Law 280, 1953===
{{details|Indian termination policy}}
In 1953, Congress enacted [[Public Law 280]], which gave some states extensive jurisdiction over the criminal and civil controversies involving Indians on Indian lands. Many, especially Indians, continue to believe the law unfair because it imposed a system of laws on the tribal nations without their approval.

In 1965 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] concluded that no law had ever extended provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including the right of [[habeas corpus]], to tribal members brought before tribal courts. Still, the court concluded, "it is pure fiction to say that the Indian courts functioning in the Fort Belknap Indian community are not in part, at least, arms of the federal government. Originally they were created by federal executive and imposed upon the Indian community, and to this day the federal government still maintains a partial control over them." In the end however, the Ninth Circuit limited its decision to the particular reservation in question and stated, "it does not follow from our decision that the tribal court must comply with every constitutional restriction that is applicable to federal or state courts."

While many modern courts in Indian nations today have established [[full faith and credit]] with state courts, the nations still have no direct access to U.S. courts. When an Indian nation files suit against a state in U.S. court, they do so with the approval of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In the modern legal era, courts and congress have, however, further refined the often competing jurisdictions of tribal nations, states and the United States in regard to Indian law.

In the 1978 case of ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'', the Supreme Court, in a 6–2 opinion authored by Justice [[William Rehnquist]], concluded that tribal courts do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians (the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at that time, [[Warren Burger]], and Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] filed a dissenting opinion). But the case left unanswered some questions, including whether tribal courts could use criminal contempt powers against non-Indians to maintain decorum in the courtroom, or whether tribal courts could subpoena non-Indians.

A 1981 case, ''[[Montana v. United States]]'', clarified that tribal nations possess inherent power over their internal affairs, and civil authority over non-members within tribal lands to the extent necessary to protect health, welfare, economic interests or political integrity of the tribal nation.

Other cases of those years precluded states from interfering with tribal nations' sovereignty. Tribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the federal government, not states, under ''Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation'' (1980). Tribes are sovereign over tribal members and tribal land, under ''United States v. Mazurie'' (1975).

In ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'', {{ussc|495|676|1990}}, the Supreme Court held that a tribal court does not have criminal jurisdiction over a non-member Indian, but that tribes "also possess their traditional and undisputed power to exclude persons who they deem to be undesirable from tribal lands. ... Tribal law enforcement authorities have the power if necessary, to eject them. Where jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside the tribe, tribal officers may exercise their power to detain and transport him to the proper authorities." In response to this decision, Congress passed the '''Duro'' Fix', which recognizes the power of tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction within their reservations over all Indians, including non-members. The ''Duro'' Fix was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Lara]]'', {{ussc|541|193|2004}}.

=== Tribal courts ===
&lt;!--[[Tribal court]] redirects here. Please change the redirect target if this section title is modified.--&gt;
At the dawn of the 21st Century, the powers of tribal courts across the United States varied, depending on whether the tribe was in a [[Public Law 280]] state (Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin) or not. Tribal courts maintain much criminal jurisdiction over their members, and because of the ''Duro'' Fix, over non-member Indians regarding crime on tribal land. The ''[[Indian Civil Rights Act]]'', however, limits tribal punishment to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal Courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. In PL280 states, the state has been granted criminal and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over activities in Indian Country. In non-PL280 states, Indian on Indian crime in Indian Country may be prosecuted in federal court if the crime is one of those listed in the ''[[Major Crimes Act]]'' (18 USC §1153). Indian on non-Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted in federal court, either from the ''MCA'', or the ''Indian Country Crimes Act'' (§1152) (unless the Indian was punished by the tribe). Non-Indian on Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted in federal court using ''ICCA''. Non-Indian on non-Indian crime in Indian Country will be prosecuted by the state.

While tribal nations do not enjoy direct access to U.S. courts to bring cases against individual states, as sovereign nations they do enjoy [[Sovereign immunity in the United States#Tribal sovereign immunity|immunity]] against many lawsuits,&lt;ref name=SCPueblo&gt;''[[Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez]]'', {{ussc|436|49|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless a plaintiff is granted a waiver by the tribe or by congressional abrogation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.]]'', {{ussc|498|505|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sovereignty extends to tribal enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Local IV-302 Int'l Woodworkers Union of Am. v.

Tribal and pueblo governments today launch far-reaching economic ventures, operate growing law enforcement agencies and adopt codes to govern conduct within their jurisdiction but the United States retains control over the scope of tribal law making. Laws adopted by Native American governments must also pass the [[Secretarial Review]] of the Department of Interior through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

===Nation to nation: tribes and the federal government===
When the United States government formed, it replaced the British government as the other sovereignty coexisting in America with the American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Michael D. and Perdue, Theda. The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears. p87. Viking, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. constitution specifically mentions American Indians three times. Article I, section 2, clause 3 and the fourteenth amendment section 2 address the handling of "Indians not taxed" in the apportionment of the seats of the House of Representatives according to population and in so doing suggest that Indians need not ''be'' taxed. In Article I section 8, clause 3, Congress is empowered to "regulate commerce with foreign nations…states…and with the Indian tribes." Technically, Congress has no more power over Indian nations than it does over individual states. In the 1970s [[Native American self-determination]] replaced [[Indian termination policy]] as the official United States policy towards Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations. p 189. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-determination]] promoted the ability of tribes to self-govern and make decisions concerning their people. It has been argued that American Indian matters should be handled through the [[United States Secretary of State]], the official responsible for foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, in dealing with Indian policy, a separate agency, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] has been in place since 1824.

The idea that tribes have an inherent right to govern themselves is at the foundation of their constitutional status — the power is not delegated by congressional acts. Congress can, however, limit tribal sovereignty. Unless a treaty or federal statute removes a power, however, the tribe is assumed to possess it.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005.  (19)&lt;/ref&gt; Current federal policy in the [[United States]] recognizes this sovereignty and stresses the government-to-government relations between [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] [[tribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040923-4.html|title=Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Indian land is held in trust by the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Some tribal lands, most commonly in Oklahoma, are held by the tribe according to the original patent deed and thus are not trust property.&lt;/ref&gt; and federal law still regulates the political and economic rights of tribal governments. Tribal jurisdiction over persons and things within tribal borders are often at issue. While tribal criminal jurisdiction over Indians is reasonably well settled, Tribes are still striving to achieve criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian persons who commit crimes in Indian Country. This is mostly due to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1978 in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' that tribes lack the inherent authority to arrest, try and convict non-Indians who commit crimes on their lands (see below for additional discussion on this point.)

===Tribal state relations: sovereign within a sovereign===
[[File:Otoe Tribal Seal.jpg|thumb|right|Otoe Tribal Seal]]
Another dispute over American Indian government is its sovereignty versus that of the states. The federal U.S. government has always been the government that makes treaties with Indian tribes – not individual states. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes".&lt;ref name=Policy-Center/&gt; This determined that Indian tribes were separate from the federal or state governments and that the states did not have power to regulate commerce with the tribes, much less regulate the tribes. The states and tribal nations have clashed over many issues such as [[Indian gaming]], fishing, and hunting. American Indians believed that they had treaties between their ancestors and the United States government, protecting their right to fish, while non-Indians believed the states were responsible for regulating commercial and sports fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations. p151. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]'' in 1968, it was ruled that "the establishment of a reservation by treaty, statute or agreement includes an implied right of Indians to hunt and fish on that reservation free of regulation by the state".&lt;ref&gt;Canby Jr., William C. American Indian Law. p449. St. Paul, MN: West Group 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; States have tried to extend their power over the tribes in many other instances, but federal government ruling has continuously ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty. A seminal court case was ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''. Chief Justice Marshall found that "England had treated the tribes as sovereign and negotiated treaties of alliance with them. The United States followed suit, thus continuing the practice of recognizing tribal sovereignty. When the United States assumed the role of protector of the tribes, it neither denied nor destroyed their sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Michael D. and Perdue, Theda.  However, England ceased to exist as a sovereign entity in 1707 to be replaced by Great Britain. Chief Justice Marshall's incorrect use of terminology appears to weaken the argument. The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears. Viking, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As determined in the Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Nice]]'' (1916),&lt;ref&gt;Lemont, Eric D. American Indian Constitutional Reform and the Rebuilding of Native Nations. University of Texas Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. citizens are subject to all U.S. laws even if they also have tribal citizenship.

The '''trolley problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You see a runaway [[tram|trolley]] moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that controls a [[railroad switch|switch]]. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track. You have two options:

# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Which is the more ethical option?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The modern form of the problem was first introduced by [[Philippa Foot]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="Philippa Foot 1978"&gt;Philippa Foot, ''[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]'' in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt; but also extensively analysed by [[Judith Thomson]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985"&gt;Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]'', 94 Yale Law Journal 1395–1415 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances Kamm]],&lt;ref&gt;Francis Myrna Kamm, ''Harming Some to Save Others'', 57 Philosophical Studies 227-60 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Unger]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; However an earlier version, in which the one person to be sacrificed on the track was the [[switchman]]'s child, was part of a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Chapman Sharp, ''A Study of the Influence of Custom on the Moral Judgment'' Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin no.236 (Madison, June 1908), 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Chapman Sharp, ''Ethics'' (New York: The Century Co, 1928), 42-44, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and the German legal scholar [[Hans Welzel]] discussed a similar problem in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Welzel, ''ZStW Zeitschrift für die gesamte Strafrechtswissenschaft'' 63 [1951], 47ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2001, the trolley problem and its variants have been used extensively in empirical research on [[moral psychology]]. Trolley problems have also been a topic of popular books.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/would-you-kill-the-fat-man-and-the-trolley-problem.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The problem often arises in the discussion of the ethics of the design of [[autonomous vehicle]]s.

== Original dilemma ==
Foot's original structure of the problem ran as follows:

{{quote|Suppose that a judge or magistrate is faced with rioters demanding that a culprit be found for a certain crime and threatening otherwise to take their own bloody revenge on a particular section of the community. The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.&lt;ref name="Philippa Foot 1978" /&gt;}}

A [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).&lt;ref&gt;Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.

[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]
The trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.

The initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:

=== The Fat Man ===
{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you – your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}

Resistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.

One clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone – harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

A claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.

Another distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area—people who are "uninvolved"—he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice your own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}

=== The fat villain ===
The further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Carneades.org|title=The Fat Villain Trolley Problem (90 Second Philosophy)|date=2013-10-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQXPDfwhGsc|accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.

=== The loop variant ===

The claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:

{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}

The only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.

The rejoining variant may not be fatal to the "using a person as a means" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article "Another Trip on the Trolley", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one. If we do nothing, then the impact of the trolley into the five will slow it down and prevent it from circling around and killing the one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As in either case some will become a means to saving others, we are permitted to count the numbers. This approach requires that we downplay the moral difference between doing and allowing.

=== Transplant ===
Here is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],&lt;ref name="Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985" /&gt; containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:

{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying persons and save their lives?}}

=== The man in the yard ===
Unger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:

{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}

Responses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.

Unger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics – in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly "involved". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not "fair game", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.

Unger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.

In 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

== Survey data ==
The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys in which approximately 90% of respondents have chosen to kill the one and save the five.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/|title='Trolley Problem': Virtual-Reality Test for Moral Dilemma – TIME.com|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the situation is modified where the one sacrificed for the five was a relative or romantic partner, respondents are much less likely to be willing to sacrifice their life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://137.140.1.71/jsec/articles/volume4/issue3/bleskefinal.pdf Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411182922/http://137.140.1.71/jsec/articles/volume4/issue3/bleskefinal.pdf |date=2012-04-11 }} – {{ISSN|1933-5377}} – volume 4(3). 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 survey published in a 2013 paper by David Bourget and [[David Chalmers]] shows that 69.9% of professional philosophers would switch (sacrifice the one individual to save five lives) in the case of the trolley problem. 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bourget|first1=David|last2=Chalmers|first2=David J.|year=2013|title=What do Philosophers believe?|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for autonomous vehicles ==
Problems analogous to the trolley problem arise in the design of [[autonomous car]]s, in situations where the car's [[software]] is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action (sometimes including options which include the death of the car's occupants), all of which may cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/|title=The Ethics of Autonomous Cars|date=October 8, 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|author=Patrick Lin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/06/18/when-should-your-driverless-car-from-google-be-allowed-to-kill-you/|title=When Should Your Driverless Car From Google Be Allowed To Kill You?|date=2014-06-18|publisher=Forbes|author=Tim Worstall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1510.03346|author2=Azim Shariff|title=Autonomous Vehicles Need Experimental Ethics: Are We Ready for Utilitarian Cars?|date=2015-10-13|author1=Jean-François Bonnefon|author3=Iyad Rahwan|doi=10.1126/science.aaf2654|volume=352|journal=Science|pages=1573–1576|bibcode=2016Sci...352.1573B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/|title=Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill|date=October 22, 2015|publisher=MIT Technology review|author=Emerging Technology From the arXiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim|last3=Rahwan|first3=Iyad|year=2016|title=The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles|journal=Science|volume=352|issue=6293|pages=1573–1576|doi=10.1126/science.aaf2654|first1=Jean-François|last1=Bonnefon|pmid=27339987|arxiv=1510.03346|bibcode=2016Sci...352.1573B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A platform called [[Moral Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moralmachine.mit.edu|title=Moral Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by [[MIT Media Lab]] to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm.

In 2016, the government of Germany constituted an ethical commission that addressed the implications of autonomous driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Publikationen/G/bericht-der-ethik-kommission.html|title=Bericht der Ethik-Kommission Automatisiertes und vernetztes Fahren|author=BMVI Commission|first=|date=June 20, 2016|website=|publisher=Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (German: Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115224017/http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Publikationen/G/bericht-der-ethik-kommission.html|archive-date=2017-11-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the commission defined 20 rules for autonomous and connected driving, which will be obligatory for upcoming laws regarding the production of autonomous cars.

== In popular culture ==
In an [[urban legend]] that has existed since at least the mid-1960s, the decision is described as having been made in real life by a drawbridge keeper who was forced to choose between sacrificing a passenger train and his own four-year-old son.&lt;ref name="SnopesDrawbridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snopes.com/glurge/drawbridge.asp|title=The Drawbridge Keeper|author=Barbara Mikkelson|date=27 February 2010|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=[[Snopes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 2003 Czech [[short film]] titled ''[[Most (2003 film)|Most]]'' (''The Bridge'' in English) and ''The Bridge'' (US) which deals with a similar plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345672/|title=Most (2003)|author=lewis-8|date=25 January 2003|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is often given as an illustration of the [[Christianity|Christian]] belief that [[penal substitution|God sacrificed his son]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name="SnopesDrawbridge" /&gt;

In the 2010 video game ''[[Fable 3]]'', one of the earliest moral choices players make involves having to choose to execute either their childhood sweetheart or a crowd of protesters. If a decision is not made within a certain period of time, the king announces that the player has five seconds to make up their mind, "or they all die."

== Criticism ==

In a 2014 paper published in the ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12131|last1=Bauman|first1=Christopher W.|last2=McGraw|first2=A.

Brianna Rennix and Nathan J. Robinson of ''[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]'' go even further and assert that the thought experiment is not only useless but downright detrimental to human psychology. The authors are opining that to make cold calculations about hypothetical situations in which every alternative will result in one or more gruesome deaths is to encourage a type of thinking that is devoid of human empathy and assumes a mandate to decide who lives or dies. They also question the premise of the scenario. "If I am forced against my will into a situation where people will die, and I have no ability to stop it, how is my choice a “moral” choice between meaningfully different options, as opposed to a horror show I’ve just been thrust into, in which I have no meaningful agency at all?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://editor.currentaffairs.org/2017/11/the-trolley-problem-will-tell-you-nothing-useful-about-morality/|title=The Trolley Problem Will Tell You Nothing Useful About Morality|last1=Rennix|first1=Brianna|last2=Robinson|first2=Nathan J.|work=[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]|date=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptions ==
Studies of social attitudes show violence is perceived as more or less serious depending on the gender of victim and perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golden|first1=Tom|title=Male Bashing in Mental Health Research|url=http://menaregood.com/bias.pdf|website=Men Are Good|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WjRbju2W?url=http://menaregood.com/bias.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2015|access-date=2 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munirkazmi | first1 = Syeda Sana | last2 = Mohyuddin | first2 = Anwaar | title = Violence against men (a case study of Naiabaadichaakra, Rawalpindi) | journal = International Journal of Environment, Ecology, Family and Urban Studies (IJEEFUS) | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = Trans Stellar | date = December 2012 | url = http://www.tjprc.org/publishpapers/--1354635512-1.%20Merged%20formatting%20files%20-Env%20eco.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feather1&gt;{{cite journal | last = Feather | first = Norm T. | title = Domestic violence, gender, and perceptions of justice | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 35 | issue = 7&amp;ndash;8 | pages = 507&amp;ndash;519 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF01544134 | date = October 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01544134 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and international law scholar Solange Mouthaan argues that, in conflict scenarios, sexual violence against men has been ignored in favor of a focus on sexual violence against women and children.&lt;ref name="Mouthaan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mouthaan | first = Solange | title = Sexual violence against men and international law – criminalising the unmentionable | journal = International Criminal Law Review | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 665&amp;ndash;695 | publisher = [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] | doi = 10.1163/15718123-01303004 | date = 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1163/15718123-01303004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for this difference in focus is the physical power that men hold over women making people more likely to condemn violence with this gender configuration.&lt;ref name="Hamby"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamby | first1 = Sherry | last2 = Jackson | first2 = Amy | title = Size does matter: the effects of gender on perceptions of dating violence | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 63 | issue = 5&amp;ndash;6 | pages = 324&amp;ndash;331 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9816-0 | date = September 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9816-0 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of male survivors of violence go against social perceptions of the male [[gender role]], leading to low recognition and few legal provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onyango |first1=Monica Adhiambo |last2=Hampanda |first2=Karen | title = Social constructions of masculinity and male survivors of wartime sexual violence: an analytical review | journal = [[International Journal of Sexual Health]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 237&amp;ndash;247 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/19317611.2011.608415 | date = 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2011.608415 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often there is no legal framework for a woman to be prosecuted when committing violent offenses against a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=S.|first=Sowmya|title=Sexual assault on men: crime that is a reality|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/sexual-assault-on-men-crime-that-is-a-reality/article1-1371605.aspx|work = [[Hindustan Times]]|date=July 22, 2015|access-date= August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Felson]] challenges the assumption that violence against women is different from violence against men. The same motives play a role in almost all violence, regardless of gender: to gain control or retribution and to promote or defend self-image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Gail Erlick | title = Violence and gender reexamined | journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 160 | issue = 9 | pages = 1711&amp;ndash;1712 | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.9.1711 | date = September 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.9.1711 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], [[Cathy Young]] criticised the feminist movement for not doing enough to challenge double standards in the treatment of male victims of physical abuse and sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Cathy|author-link=Cathy Young|title=Sorry, Emma Watson, but HeForShe is rotten for men|url=http://time.com/3432838/emma-watson-feminism-men-women/|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=September 26, 2014|access-date= August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic violence ==

In 2013 editor-in-chief of the journal ''Partner Abuse'', John Hamel,&lt;ref name=PartnerAbuse1&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=John|editor1-first=Hamel|title=Partner abuse new directions in research, intervention, and policy|url=http://www.springerpub.com/journals/partner-abuse.html|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|issn=1946-6560}}&lt;/ref&gt; set up the Domestic Violence Research Group to create the "Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project (PASK)".&lt;ref name=PASK1&gt;{{cite web|title=About PASK, the Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project |url=http://www.domesticviolenceresearch.org/ |website=domesticviolenceresearch.org |publisher=DV Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; PASK found parity in rates of both perpetration and victimisation for men and women.&lt;ref name=PASK_PR1&gt;{{cite press release|last = Salem | first = Dara |title=Unprecedented domestic violence study affirms need to recognize male victims |url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10741752.htm|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |agency=PRWEB |date=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men who are victims of [[domestic violence]] are at times reluctant to report it or to seek help. According to some commentators there is also a paradigm that only males perpetrate domestic violence and are never victims.&lt;ref name=Woods1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Michael|title=The rhetoric and reality of men and violence|format=pdf|url=http://mhaweb.squarespace.com/storage/files/woods_nmhc_07.pdf|publisher=Men's Health Australia|ref=Woods1|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WjNlM5FR?url=http://mhaweb.squarespace.com/storage/files/woods_nmhc_07.pdf|archivedate=March 2, 2015|date=October 19, 2007|access-date=December 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shamita Das Dasgupta]] and [[Erin Pizzey]] are amongst those who argue that, as with other forms of violence against men, [[intimate partner violence]] is generally less recognized in society when the victims are men.&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Das Dasgupta | first = Shamita | author-link = Shamita Das Dasgupta | title = A framework for understanding women's use of nonlethal violence in intimate heterosexual relationships | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1364&amp;ndash;1389 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/107780102237408 | date = November 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/107780102237408 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pizzey | first = Erin | author-link = Erin Pizzey | title = This way to the revolution: a memoir |page=114 | publisher = Peter Owen | location = London Chicago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hACBAAAQBAJ | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780720615210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Violence of women against men in relationships is often 'trivialized'&lt;ref name=TimeHopeSolo /&gt;&lt;ref name="BuzawaBuzawa2003"&gt;Schlesinger Buzawa, Eva; Buzawa, Carl G.

==Female violence against men==
According to the journalist [[Martin Daubney]] "...there remains a theory that men under report their experiences [of violence by women against men] due to a culture of masculine expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Daubney | first = Martin | author-link = Martin Daubney | title = Why female violence against men is society's last great taboo | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/why-female-violence-against-men-is-societys-last-great-taboo/ | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 15 March 2016 | access-date = 2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official figure in the [[United Kingdom]], for example, is about 50% of the number of acts of violence by men against women, but there are indications that only about 10% of male victims of female violence report the incidents to the authorities, mainly due to taboos and fears of misunderstanding created by a culture of masculine expectations.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news| last = Daubney | first = Martin | author-link = Martin Daubney | title = Why female violence against men is society's last great taboo | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/why-female-violence-against-men-is-societys-last-great-taboo/ | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 15 March 2016 | access-date = 2 December 2016 }}

The United Nations' resolution deals with human rights and resolutions to issues that are presented at hand. It should be noted that the resolutions developed are intended to be implemented into the communities of the world but not legally enforceable under law.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_resolution|title=United Nations Resolution|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman human rights defender can be an Indigenous woman fighting for the rights of her community, a woman advocating against torture, an [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTQI]] rights campaigner, a sex workers’ rights collective, or a man fighting for sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like other [[human rights defenders]], women human rights defenders can be the target of attacks as they demand the realization of human rights. They face attacks such as discrimination, assault, threats, and violence within their communities.  However, women human rights defenders face additional obstacles based on who they are and the specific rights they defend. This means they are targeted just because they are women, LGBTI people or for identifying with their struggles. They also face additional obstacles connected with systemic discrimination and inequality and because they challenge, or are seen to be challenging, patriarchal power and social norms. They are more at risk of facing gender based violence in the home and the community, and sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, trans-phobic threats, smears and stigmatization, as well as exclusion from resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20936&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} International Women Human Rights Defenders Day –29 November 2016|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women that work to fight for human rights have numerous meetings with the UN Human Rights Council in conjunction with the LGBTQI defenders in Uganda who face prejudice and discrimination as well for The Women Human Rights Defenders understand the struggles being endured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/our-work/|title=Our Work {{!}}|website=www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wood plastic composite.JPG|right|thumb|Wood plastic composite]]
'''Wood-plastic composites''' (WPCs) are [[composite material]]s made of [[Wood fibre|wood fiber]]/[[wood flour]] and thermoplastic(s) (includes [[Polythene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[PVC]], [[Polylactic acid|PLA]] etc.).

In addition to wood fiber and plastic, WPCs can also contain other ligno-cellulosic and/or inorganic filler materials. WPCs are a subset of a larger category of materials called natural fiber plastic composites (NFPCs), which may contain no [[cellulose]]-based fiber fillers such as pulp fibers, [[peanut]] hulls, [[bamboo]], [[straw]], [[digestate]], etc.

Chemical additives seem practically "invisible" (except mineral fillers and pigments, if added) in the composite structure. They provide for integration of polymer and wood flour (powder) while facilitating optimal processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com/p/what-is-wood-plastic-composite-wpc.html|title=WPC machines &amp; equipment. WPC pellets and additives. Composite decking lumber.|work=wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, people in the flooring industry starts referring to '''WPC''' as a type of floor that has a basic structure of top vinyl veneer plus a rigid extruded core (the core can be made without any wood fiber). WPC is now an established product category within LVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruise|first1=Mallory|title=WPC gains ground at Domotex Hannover 2016|url=http://www.dgmfloors.com/new_detail/nid/2992.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|agency=Floor Covering Weekly|issue=FCW Global February 2016|publisher=Floor Covering Weekly|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of WPC is different than the WPC decking and is not intended for outdoor usage.

== Uses ==
Wood-plastic composites are still new materials relative to the long history of natural lumber as a building material. The most widespread use of WPCs in North America is in outdoor [[Deck (building)|deck]] floors, but it is also used for railings, fences, landscaping timbers, [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] and siding, park [[Bench (furniture)|benches]], [[moulding (decorative)|molding and trim]], [[window]] and [[door]] frames, and indoor [[furniture]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemons, C. (2002) "Wood-plastic Composites in the United States: The interfacing of two Industries" '' Forest Products Journal '' 52(6)&lt;/ref&gt; Wood-plastic composites were first introduced into the decking market in the early 1990s.

These materials can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpcextruder.com/news_show-13.html Introduction of WPC Wood Plastic Composite Products&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Wood-plastic composites (WPCs) are produced by thoroughly mixing ground wood particles and heated [[thermoplastic]] resin. The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though [[injection molding]] is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including [[high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polystyrene|PS]], and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. Polyethylene-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorants]], [[coupling agent]]s, [[UV stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.

In some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktron.com/industries_served/plastics/woodplastic.cfm|title=Wood-Plastic Composites production requires high formulation quality the feeding system|work=ktron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C) lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around 400&amp;nbsp;°F (204&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greendotpure.com/materials/wood-composites/|title = Wood Plastic Composites – Green Dot|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that’s too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]
WPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and [[Gribble|Marine Borer]] attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, N. (2001) “Influence of Moisture Absorption on Mechanical Properties of Wood Flour-Polypropylene Composites.” '' Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials'' 14&lt;/ref&gt; Water absorption is more pronounced in WFCs with a hydrophilic matrix such as PLA and also leads to decreased mechanical stiffness and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffre|first=Thomas|last2=Segerholm|first2=Kristoffer|last3=Persson|first3=Cecilia|last4=Bardage|first4=Stig L.|last5=Luengo Hendriks|first5=Cris L.|last6=Isaksson|first6=Per|date=2017-01|title=Characterization of interfacial stress transfer ability in acetylation-treated wood fibre composites using X-ray microtomography|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|journal=Industrial Crops and Products|volume=95|pages=43–49|doi=10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|issn=0926-6690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical performance in a wet environment can be enhanced by an acetylation treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsson|first=P.|last2=Simonson|first2=R.|date=1994-04-01|title=A study of strength, hardness and deformation of acetylated Scandinavian softwoods|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02615470|journal=Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=83–86|doi=10.1007/BF02615470|issn=0018-3768}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFCs have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using [[recycled plastic]]s and the waste products of the [[wood industry]]. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Scott (2008). “Synthetic Decking” [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/remodeling/synthetic-decking.aspx]. Remodeling Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Ultra Polymers? |publisher=Solvay |date=2014

(2011) '' Modeling the Time-dependent Flexural Response of Wood-plastic Composite Materials '' Dissertation, University of Wisconsin–Madison&lt;/ref&gt; The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, J et al.(2006) “Durability of wood-plastic composites.” ''Wood Design Focus'' 16(3)&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.

== WPC sandwich boards ==
WPC boards show good set of performance but monolithic composite sheets are relatively heavy (most often heavier than pure plastics) which limits their use to applications where low weight is not essential. WPC in a [[sandwich-structured composite]] form allow for combination of the benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology. WPC sandwich boards consist of wood polymer composite skins and usually low density polymer core which leads to a very effective increase of panel's rigidity. WPC sandwich boards are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renolit.com/composites/en/products/automotive/honeycomb-structure/|title=WPC honeycomb panels|publisher=Renolit.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC sandwich boards at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econcore.com/en/technology/thermhex|title=Sandwich Panel Technology |publisher=EconCore.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Environmental impact===
The [[environmental impact]] of WPCs is directly affected by the ratio of renewable to [[non-renewable]] materials. The commonly used [[petroleum]]-based polymers have a negative environmental impact because they rely on non-renewable raw materials and the non-[[biodegradability]] of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=A. Kutnar and S.S. Muthu|title=Environmental Impacts of Traditional and Innovative Forest-based Bioproducts, Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-0655-5_2|chapter=Wood-Plastic Composites—Performance and Environmental Impacts|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789811006531-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1554323-p179867938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire hazards ===
The types of plastic normally used in WPC formulations have higher [[fire hazard]] properties than wood alone, as plastic has a higher chemical [[heat content]] and can melt. The inclusion of plastic as a portion of the composite results in the potential for higher fire hazards in WPCs as compared with wood. Some code officials are becoming increasingly concerned with the fire performance of WPCs.&lt;ref&gt;http://wpcinfo.org/techinfo/Fire_Studies.html Washington State University Wood Plastic Composites Information Center, "Fire Issues in Engineered Wood Composites for Naval Waterfront Facilities", 46th International SAMPE Symposium and Exhibition, Long Beach, California, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enn.com/business/article/24261 Environmental News Network, "California Fire Codes Put Focus on Plastic Decking Concerns" 5 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:XOR Swap.svg|thumb|upright=2|alt=With three XOR operations the binary values 1010 and 0011 are exchanged between variables.|Using the XOR swap algorithm to exchange [[nibble]]s between variables without the use of temporary storage]]

In [[computer programming]], the '''XOR swap''' is an [[algorithm]] that uses the [[exclusive disjunction|XOR]] [[bitwise operation]] to [[swap (computer science)|swap]] values of distinct [[variable (programming)|variable]]s having the same [[data type]] without using a temporary variable. "Distinct" means that the variables are stored at different, non-overlapping, memory addresses; the actual values of the variables do not have to be different.

==The algorithm==
Conventional swapping requires the use of a temporary storage variable. Using the XOR swap algorithm, however, no temporary storage is needed. The algorithm is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/BitOp/xor.html |title=The Magic of XOR |publisher=Cs.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#SwappingValuesXOR|title=Swapping Values with XOR|publisher=graphics.stanford.edu|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
Y := Y XOR X
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The algorithm typically corresponds to three [[machine code|machine-code]] instructions. Since XOR is a [[commutative operation]], X XOR Y can be replaced with Y XOR X in any of the lines. When coded in assembly language, this commutativity is often exercised in the second line:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 45em;"
|-
! Pseudocode !! IBM [[System/370]] assembly !! x86 assembly
|-
| {{code|1=X := X XOR Y|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R1,R2|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    eax, ebx|2=asm}}
|-
| {{code|1=Y := Y XOR X|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R2,R1|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    ebx, eax|2=asm}}
|-
| {{code|1=X := X XOR Y|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R1,R2|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    eax, ebx|2=asm}}
|}

In the above System/370 assembly code sample, R1 and R2 are distinct [[processor register|register]]s, and each XR operation leaves its result in the register named in the first argument. Using x86 assembly, values X and Y are in registers eax and ebx (respectively), and {{code|xor|2=asm}} places the result of the operation in the first register.

However, the algorithm fails if ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, since the value stored in that location will be zeroed out by the first XOR instruction, and then remain zero; it will not be "swapped with itself". Note that this is ''not'' the same as if ''x'' and ''y'' have the same values.  The trouble only comes when ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, in which case their values must already be equal. That is, if ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, then the line:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
sets ''x'' to zero (because ''x'' = ''y'' so X XOR Y is zero) ''and'' sets ''y'' to zero (since it uses the same storage location), causing ''x'' and ''y'' to lose their original values.

==Proof of correctness==
The [[binary operation]] XOR over bit strings of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; exhibits the following properties (where &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denotes XOR):{{Efn|The first three properties, along with the existence of an inverse for each element, are the definition of an [[abelian group]]. The last property is the statement that every element is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], that is, having [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2, which is not true of all abelian groups.}}

* '''L1.''' [[Commutative operation|Commutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;A \oplus B = B \oplus A&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L2.''' [[Associativity]]: &lt;math&gt;(A \oplus B) \oplus C = A \oplus (B \oplus C)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L3.''' [[Identity element|Identity exists]]: there is a bit string, 0, (of length ''N'') such that &lt;math&gt;A \oplus 0 = A&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L4.''' Each element is its own [[inverse element|inverse]]: for each &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \oplus A = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that we have two distinct registers &lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;R2&lt;/code&gt; as in the table below, with initial values ''A'' and ''B'' respectively. We perform the operations below in sequence, and reduce our results using the properties listed above.

|}

=== Linear algebra interpretation ===
As XOR can be interpreted as binary addition and a pair of values can be interpreted as a point in two-dimensional space, the steps in the algorithm can be interpreted as 2&amp;times;2 matrices with binary values. For simplicity, assume initially that ''x'' and ''y'' are each single bits, not bit vectors.

For example, the step:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which also has the implicit:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
Y := Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
corresponds to the matrix &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}x+y\\y\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The sequence of operations is then expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\1 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
(working with binary values, so &lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;), which expresses the [[elementary matrix]] of switching two rows (or columns) in terms of the [[Shear mapping|transvections]] (shears) of adding one element to the other.

To generalize to where X and Y are not single bits, but instead bit vectors of length ''n'', these 2&amp;times;2 matrices are replaced by 2''n''&amp;times;2''n'' [[block matrices]] such as &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}I_n &amp; I_n\\0 &amp; I_n\end{smallmatrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these matrices are operating on ''values,'' not on ''variables'' (with storage locations), hence this interpretation abstracts away from issues of storage location and the problem of both variables sharing the same storage location.

==Code example==
A [[C (programming language)|C]] function that implements the XOR swap algorithm:
&lt;!-- This display template is broken in IE 6, the top half of the pretty bordered box is cut off. --&gt;
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 void xorSwap (int *x, int *y) {
     if (x != y) {
         *x ^= *y;
         *y ^= *x;
         *x ^= *y;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the code does not swap the integers passed immediately, but first checks if their addresses are distinct. This is because, if the addresses are equal, the algorithm will fold to a triple *x ^= *x resulting in zero.

The code below is an example of overly-concise C code; the behavior of the code is undefined. (Writing overly-concise C code has become unnecessary as modern optimizing compilers will eliminate intermediate results and temporary variables.)
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 /* kcc: "Undefined behavior - Error: EIO8
    Description: unsequenced side effect on scalar object with value computation of same object."
    See: https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics and https://runtimeverification.com/match/1.0-SNAPSHOT/docs/runningexamples/
    There are no sequence points to force the execution of (*y=*x) last - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point
 */
 void xorSwap (int *x, int *y) {
     *x ^= *y ^= ( *y ^= *x );
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The XOR swap algorithm can also be defined with a macro:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#define XORSWAP_UNSAFE(a, b)	((a)^=(b),(b)^=(a),(a)^=(b)) /* Doesn't work when a and b are the same object - assigns zero (0) to the object in that case */
#define XORSWAP(a, b)   ((&amp;(a) == &amp;(b)) ? (a) : ((a)^=(b),(b)^=(a),(a)^=(b))) /* checks that the addresses of a and b are different before XOR-ing */
&lt;/source&gt;

==Reasons for use in practice==
In most practical scenarios, the trivial swap algorithm using a temporary register is more efficient. Limited situations in which XOR swapping may be practical include:

* on a processor where the instruction set encoding permits the XOR swap to be encoded in a smaller number of bytes
* in a region with high [[register pressure]], it may allow the [[register allocator]] to avoid [[spilling a register]]
* in [[microcontrollers]] where available RAM is very limited.
* in cryptographic applications which need constant time functions to prevent time-based side-channel attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Tadayoshi Kohno, Niels Ferguson, Bruce|title=Cryptography engineering : design principles and practical applications|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Pub., inc.|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-0-470-47424-2|page=251 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these situations are rare, most optimizing compilers do not generate XOR swap code.

==Reasons for avoidance in practice==
Most modern compilers can optimize away the temporary variable in the native swap, in which case the native swap uses the same amount of memory and the same number of registers as the XOR swap and is at least as fast, and often faster. The XOR swap is also much less readable and completely opaque to anyone unfamiliar with the technique.

On modern [[CPU architecture]]s, the XOR technique can be slower than using a temporary variable to do swapping. One reason is that modern CPUs strive to execute instructions in parallel via [[instruction pipeline]]s. In the XOR technique, the inputs to each operation depend on the results of the previous operation, so they must be executed in strictly sequential order, negating any benefits of [[instruction-level parallelism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Saman |last1=Amarasinghe |first2=Charles |last2=Leiserson |title=6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems, Lecture 2 |year=2010 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |website=MIT OpenCourseWare |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-2-bit-hacks/ |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical reason was that it used to be patented (US4197590).  Even then, this was only for computer graphics.

===Aliasing===
The XOR swap is also complicated in practice by [[aliasing (computing)|aliasing]]. As noted above, if an attempt is made to XOR-swap the contents of some location with itself, the result is that the location is zeroed out and its value lost. Therefore, XOR swapping must not be used blindly in a high-level language if aliasing is possible.

Similar problems occur with [[call by name]], as in [[Jensen's Device]], where swapping &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; via a temporary variable yields incorrect results due to the arguments being related: swapping via &lt;code&gt;temp = i; i = A[i]; A[i] = temp&lt;/code&gt; changes the value for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in the second statement, which then results in the incorrect i value for &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; in the third statement.

==Variations==
The underlying principle of the XOR swap algorithm can be applied to any operation meeting criteria L1 through L4 above. Replacing XOR by addition and subtraction gives a slightly different, but largely equivalent, formulation:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 void addSwap (unsigned int *x, unsigned int *y)
 {
     if (x != y) {
         *x = *x + *y;
         *y = *x - *y;
         *x = *x - *y;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike the XOR swap, this variation requires that the underlying processor or programming language uses a method such as [[modular arithmetic]] or [[bignum]]s to guarantee that the computation of &lt;code&gt;X + Y&lt;/code&gt; cannot cause an error due to [[integer overflow]]. Therefore, it is seen even more rarely in practice than the XOR swap.

Note, however, that the implementation of &lt;code&gt;addSwap&lt;/code&gt; above in the C programming language always works even in case of integer overflow, since, according to the C standard, addition and  subtraction of unsigned integers follow the rules of [[modular arithmetic]], i. e. are done in the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2^s\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits of &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed, the correctness of the algorithm follows from the fact that the formulas &lt;math&gt;(x + y) - y = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x + y) - ((x + y) - y) = y&lt;/math&gt; hold in any [[abelian group]]. This is actually a generalization of the proof for the XOR swap algorithm: XOR is both the addition and subtraction in the abelian group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Please note that the above doesn't hold when dealing with the &lt;code&gt;signed int&lt;/code&gt; type (the default for &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;). Signed integer overflow is an undefined behavior in C and thus modular arithmetic is not guaranteed by the standard (a standard-conforming compiler might optimize out such code, which leads to incorrect results).
