'''Adrian Bowyer''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|j|ər}} is an English engineer and mathematician, formerly an academic at the [[University of Bath]].
[[File:Adrian Bowyer - PopTech 2007.webm|thumb|Adrian talking about the [[RepRap Project]] at [[Poptech]] 2007]]
Born in 1952 in London, Bowyer is the older child of the late Rosemary and John Bowyer; the latter was a writer, painter and one of the founders of Zisman, Bowyer and Partners, consulting engineers.  Bowyer was educated at Woodroffe School,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodroffe.dorset.sch.uk/ Woodroffe School&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyme Regis]] and [[Imperial College London]].

In 1977 he joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of Bath]]. Shortly after that he received a doctorate from [[Imperial College London]] for research in friction-induced vibration. Whilst working in the Mathematics Department he invented (at the same time as David Watson) the algorithm for computing [[Voronoi diagram]]s that bears their names (the [[Bowyer–Watson algorithm]]).

[[File:Robot 3D print timelapse on RepRapPro Fisher.webm|thumb|A timelapse video of a robot model (logo of [[Make (magazine)|Make magazine]]) being printed using [[fused deposition modeling]] on a RepRapPro Fisher printer, a company that Bowyer was a director of.]]
He then spent twenty-two years as a lecturer then senior lecturer in the  Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Bath.  He retired from academic life in 2012, though he is still a director of the company RepRap Ltd&lt;ref&gt;http://reprapltd.com RepRap Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the [[RepRap Project]] – an open-source self-replicating 3D printer. [[The Guardian]] said of this, "[RepRap] has been called the invention that will bring down global capitalism, start a second industrial revolution and save the environment..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/christmas2006/story/0,,1956793,00.html Put your feet up, Santa, the Christmas machine has arrived], James Randerson at [[The Guardian]], 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Bowyer received the 3D Printing Industry Outstanding Contribution to 3D Printing Award &lt;ref&gt;[https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/3d-printing-industry-awards-winners-announced-113809/ Dr Adrian Bowyer receives Outstanding Contribution to 3D Printing Award]&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the TCT Hall of Fame &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tctawards.com/hall-of-fame/|title=Hall Of Fame|website=TCT Awards 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

His wife is a retired school teacher; they have one adult daughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3432">'''Axiomatic design''' is a [[systems design]] [[methodology]] using [[matrix methods]] to systematically analyze the transformation of customer needs into functional requirements, design parameters, and process variables.&lt;ref&gt;*Suh (1990), ''The Principles of Design'', Oxford University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-504345-6}}
*Suh (2001). ''Axiomatic Design: Advances and Applications'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-513466-4}}
*Suh (2005). ''Complexity: Theory and Applications'', Oxford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-517876-9}}
*El-Haik, ''Axiomatic Quality'', Wiley, 2005, {{ISBN|0-471-68273-X}}
*Stamatis, ''Six Sigma and Beyond: Design for Six Sigma, Volume VI'', CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57444-315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, functional requirements (FRs) are related to design parameters (DPs):
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} FR_1 \\ FR_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} DP_1 \\ DP_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method gets its name from its use of design principles or design [[Axioms]] (i.e., given without proof) governing the analysis and [[decision making process]] in developing high quality product or system designs.  The two axioms used in Axiomatic Design (AD) are:

* Axiom 1: '''The Independence Axiom'''.  Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs).
* Axiom 2: '''The Information Axiom'''.  Minimize the information content of the design.

Axiomatic design is considered to be a design method that addresses fundamental issues in [[Taguchi methods]].

The methodology was developed by Dr. [[Suh Nam Pyo]] at MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering since the 1990s. A series of academic conferences have been held to present current developments of the methodology. The most recent International Conference on Axiomatic Design (ICAD) was the 11th ICAD hosted in Romania in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icad.tcm.cmmi.tuiasi.ro/|title=11th ICAD|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Breast pain''' is the symptom of discomfort in the [[breast]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iddon |first1=J |last2=Dixon |first2=JM |title=Mastalgia. |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |date=13 December 2013 |volume=347 |pages=f3288 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f3288 |pmid=24336097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the [[menstrual period]] is generally not serious.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Breast pain |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-pain/ |website=NHS |accessdate=30 October 2018|date=2017-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; It is particular concerning if a hard [[breast mass|mass]] or [[nipple discharge]] is also present.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes may be related to the [[menstrual cycle]], [[birth control pills]], [[hormone therapy]], or [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salzman |first1=B |last2=Fleegle |first2=S |last3=Tully |first3=AS |title=Common breast problems. |journal=American Family Physician |date=15 August 2012 |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=343–9 |pmid=22963023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during [[menopause]], and in early [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=Maz2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mazza |first1=Danielle |title=Women's Health in General Practice |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0729578714 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_Q7IO4ACO1cC&amp;pg=PA189 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis involves [[breast examination|examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt; Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptom, along with [[breast mass]]es and nipple discharge.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

==Causes==
Cyclical breast pain is often associated with [[fibrocystic breast changes]] or [[duct ectasia]] and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to [[thyrotropin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1159/000180038| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Faggiuolo| first2 = R| last3 = Ferusso| first3 = A| last4 = Orlandi| first4 = F| last5 = Sandrucci| first5 = S| last6 = Tibo| first6 = A| last7 = Angeli| first7 = A| title = Prolactin and thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in premenopausal women with fibrocystic disease of the breast| journal = Hormone Research| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 137–44| year = 1985| pmid = 3922866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF01658413| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Orlandi| first2 = F| last3 = Angeli| first3 = A| title = The endocrine basis of benign breast disorders| journal = World Journal of Surgery| volume = 13| issue = 6| pages = 674–9| year = 1989| pmid = 2696218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with [[menstruation]] and/or [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

Noncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in [[puberty]] (both in girls and boys), in [[menopause]] and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include [[alcoholism]] with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), [[mastitis]] and medications such as [[digitalis]], [[methyldopa]] (an [[antihypertensive]]), [[spironolactone]], certain [[diuretic]]s, [[oxymetholone]] (an [[anabolic steroid]]), and [[chlorpromazine]] (a [[typical antipsychotic]]).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Also, [[shingles]] can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Some women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear [[breast cancer]]. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cash2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Cash | first = Jill | title = Family practice guidelines | publisher = Springer Publishing | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780826197825 }}, [Electronic book] Section I Guidelines, Chapter Thirteen: Gynecologic Guidelines-Breast Pain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis involves [[breast examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Medical imaging by [[ultrasound]] is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with [[mammography]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

Ruling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to:

{{div col end}}

Diagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are [[mammogram]], [[excisional biopsy]] for solid lumps, [[fine-needle aspiration]] and biopsy, [[pregnancy test]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

==Treatment==
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

[[Bromocriptine]] may be used aswell.&lt;ref name="SchuilingLikis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kerri Durnell Schuiling|author2=Frances E. Likis|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj_ourS3PBMC&amp;pg=PA381|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-5637-6|pages=381–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spironolactone, low dose [[oral contraceptives]], and low-dose [[estrogen]] have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. [[Vitamin E]] is not effective in relieving pain nor is [[evening primrose oil]]. [[Vitamin B6|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[vitamin A]] have not been consistently found to be beneficial. [[Flaxseed]] has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

Pain may be relieved by the use of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or, for more severe localized pain, by [[local anaesthetic]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt; Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;

Information regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Learning [[breast self-examination]] helps to orient the woman to normal and expected texture and structure of the breast and nipple. [[Yearly breast exams]] may be suggested. [[Counseling]] can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non-pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. [[Methylxanthine]]s can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in [[salt]], though no evidence supports this practice.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8152">'''Communication-Avoiding Algorithms''' minimize movement of data within a [[memory hierarchy]] for improving its running-time and energy consumption. These minimize the total of two costs (in terms of time and energy): arithmetic and communication. Communication, in this context refers to moving data, either between levels of memory or between multiple processors over a network. It is much more expensive than arithmetic.&lt;ref name="demmel2012"&gt;Demmel, Jim. "Communication avoiding algorithms." 2012 SC Companion: High Performance Computing, Networking Storage and Analysis. IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
Consider the following running-time model:&lt;ref&gt;Demmel, James, and Kathy Yelick. "Communication Avoiding (CA) and Other Innovative Algorithms." The Berkeley Par Lab: Progress in the Parallel Computing Landscape: 243-250.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measure of computation = Time per [[FLOP]] = γ
* Measure of communication = No. of words of data moved = β
⇒ Total running time = γ*(no. of [[FLOP]]s) + β*(no. of words)

From the fact that '''β &gt;&gt; γ''' as measured in time and energy, communication cost dominates computation cost. Technological trends&lt;ref name="darpa2008"&gt;Bergman, Keren, et al. "[http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/ics/ahkhan/Resources/Articles/ExaScale%20Computing/TR-2008-13.pdf Exascale computing study: Technology challenges in exascale computing systems]." [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] (DARPA IPTO), Tech. Rep 15 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the relative cost of communication is increasing on a variety of platforms, from [[cloud computing]] to [[supercomputers]] to mobile devices. The report also predicts that gap between [[DRAM]] access time and FLOPs will increase 100x over coming decade to balance power usage between processors and DRAM.&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt;

Energy consumption increases by orders of magnitude as we go higher in the memory hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Shalf, John, Sudip Dosanjh, and John Morrison. "Exascale computing technology challenges." High Performance Computing for Computational Science–VECPAR 2010. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; United States president Barack Obama cited Communication-Avoiding Algorithms in the FY 2012 Department of Energy budget request to Congress:&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt; ''“New Algorithm Improves Performance and Accuracy on Extreme-Scale Computing Systems. '''On modern computer architectures, communication between processors takes longer than the performance of a floating point arithmetic operation by a given processor'''. ASCR researchers have developed a new method, derived from commonly used linear algebra methods, '''to minimize communications between processors and the memory hierarchy, by reformulating the communication patterns specified within the algorithm.''' This method has been implemented in the TRILINOS framework, a highly-regarded suite of software, which provides functionality for researchers around the world to solve large scale, complex multi-physics problems.”''

== Objective ==
Communication-Avoiding algorithms are designed with the following objectives:
* Reorganize algorithms to reduce communication across all memory hierarchies.
* Attain the lower-bound on communication when possible.

The following simple example&lt;ref name="demmel2012" /&gt; demonstrates how these are achieved.

=== Matrix Multiplication Example ===
Let A, B and C be square matrices of order n x n. The following naive algorithm implements C = C + A * B:

[[File:Matrix_multiplication_algorithm_diagram.png|500px|]]
  for i = 1 to n
      for j = 1 to n
          for k = 1 to n
          C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)

Arithmetic cost (time-complexity): n² (2n-1) for sufficiently large n or O(n³).

Rewriting this algorithm with communication cost labelled at each step

  for i = 1 to n
      {read row i of A into fast memory}               - n² reads
      for j = 1 to n
          {read C(i,j) into fast memory}               - n² reads
          {read column j of B into fast memory}        - n³ reads
          for k = 1 to n
              C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)
              {write C(i,j) back to slow memory}       - n² writes

Fast memory may be defined as the local processor memory ([[CPU cache]]) of size M and slow memory may be defined as the DRAM.

Communication cost (reads/writes): n³ + 3n² or O(n³)

Since total running time = γ*O(n³) + β*O(n³) and β &gt;&gt; γ the communication cost is dominant. The Blocked (Tiled) Matrix Multiplication algorithm&lt;ref name="demmel2012"/&gt; reduces this dominant term.

==== Blocked (Tiled) Matrix Multiplication ====

Consider A,B,C to be n/b-by-n/b matrices of b-by-b sub-blocks where b is called the block size;	assume 3 b-by-b blocks fit in fast memory.

[[File:Tiled_matrix_multiplication_diagram.png|500px|]]
     for i = 1 to n/b
         for j = 1 to n/b
         {read block C(i,j) into fast memory}           - b² × (n/b)² = n² reads
         for k = 1 to n/b
             {read block A(i,k) into fast memory}       - b² × (n/b)³ = n³/b reads 
             {read block B(k,j) into fast memory}       - b² × (n/b)³ = n³/b reads
             C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)          - {do a matrix multiply on blocks}
         {write block C(i,j) back to slow memory}       - b² × (n/b)² = n² writes

Communication cost: 2n³/b + 2n² reads/writes &lt;&lt; 2n³ arithmetic cost

Making b as large possible:
3b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ M 
We achieve the following communication lowerbound:
3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;  + 2n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  or Ω(no. of FLOPs / M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; )

== Previous approaches for reducing communication == 
Most of the approaches investigated in the past to address this problem rely on scheduling or tuning techniques that aim at overlapping communication with computation. However, this approach can lead to an improvement of at most a factor of two. Ghosting is a different technique for reducing communication, in which a processor stores and computes redundantly data from neighboring processors for future computations. Cache-oblivious algorithms represent a different approach introduced in 1999 for Fast Fourier Transforms,&lt;ref&gt;M. Frigo, C. E. Leiserson, H. Prokop, and S. Ramachandran, “Cacheoblivious algorithms,” In FOCS ’99: Proceedings of the 40th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1999. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and then extended to graph algorithms, dynamic programming, etc. They were also applied to several operations in linear algebra&lt;ref&gt;S. Toledo, “[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d198/43912d46f6a25de815eadb1fb43d5ca6f61c.pdf Locality of reference in LU Decomposition with partial pivoting],”
SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., vol. 18, no. 4, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Gustavson, “Recursion Leads to Automatic Variable Blocking for Dense Linear-Algebra Algorithms,” IBM Journal of Research and Development, vol. 41, no. 6, pp. 737–755, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.

Kagstrom, “[http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/2D1253/matalg06/SIR000003.pdf Recursive blocked algorithms and hybrid data structures for dense matrix library software],” SIAM Review, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 3–45, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; as dense LU and QR factorizations. The design of architecture specific algorithms is another approach that can be used for reducing the communication in parallel algorithms, and there are many examples in the literature of algorithms that are adapted to a given communication topology.&lt;ref&gt;Grigori, Laura.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7049">'''Community indicators''' are "measurements that provide information about past and current trends and assist planners and community leaders in making decisions that affect future outcomes". They provide insight into the overall direction of a community: whether it is improving, declining, or staying the same, or is some mix of all three.

In essence, indicators are measurements that reflect the interplay between social, environmental, and economic factors affecting a region’s or community’s [[Quality of life|well-being]]. Community indicators projects typically are conducted by [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]] within a community, although in some cases they are initiated by the public sector.

== History of community indicators ==
Community indicators are a localized response to the perceived invalidity of the traditional predominantly economic indicators, such as GDP, that are used for measuring human progress. This invalidity takes two forms. First, economic indicators account for all money transactions as beneficial for quality of life, whereas some of these can be seen as decidedly negative (e.g., money spent on environmental cleanup of pollution that could have been prevented). Secondly, strictly economic indicators do not count the value of non-monetary activity, such as homemaker and volunteer work and non-cash public assistance, which are decidedly positive for the quality of life of many families (Journal article by David Swain, Danielle Hollar; International Journal of Public Administration, Vol. 26, 2003).

A communities level approach to this apparent invalidity is based on the evidence of a social group whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common culture and history. Community indicators are not a new concept; they have been in use since 1910, when the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] initiated the development of local surveys for measuring industrial, educational, recreational, and other factors. The processes used by the Sage Foundation are similar to those that reemerged during the 1990s. But the difference today is the use of indicators to consider the full spectrum of a community’s well-being, not just isolated factors. Nowadays, indicators are used by many constituencies within a [[community]]. After a decade of renewed attention to community indicators, they now represent a valuable mechanism to improve monitoring and evaluation in planning.

Russell Sage Foundation employed “over two thousand local surveys taken on education, recreation, [[public health]], crime, and general social conditions” to assess social conditions. The first survey was conducted in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. (In the late 1990s, Pittsburgh again embraced indicators, with its Sustainable Pittsburgh Goals and Indicators Project.) Many of the surveys used
by the Sage Foundation were conducted by nonprofit organizations, such as [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]] and citizen committees. These surveys yielded social trends indicators and were popular until [[Great Depression|the Great Depression]] and World War II, when economic measures such as the [[gross domestic product]] or [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] indicators took greater precedence

== Community information systems objectives ==
'''Community information systems''' ('''CIS''') bring together a wide range of community indicators — [[social]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] data and information around objectives:
* Monitoring the health, social well-being and sustainability of communities through the management of Quality of Life indicators;
* Bringing together government performance indicators and community targeted indicators into a single solution;
* Widening the use of data by citizens and public officials to support decision-making, improve policy and target resources;
* Providing a wider local intelligence context to [[key performance indicators]] for government officials;
* Communicating outcome measures to citizens, stimulating public debate and building confidence in progress towards societal goals.

The text on the poster is the Geneva Declaration. In front are Prime Minister [[Andrey Lyapchev]] and Metropolitan [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Stefan of Sofia]]]]
The '''Declaration of the Rights of the Child''', sometimes known as the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child, is an international document promoting child rights, drafted by [[Eglantyne Jebb]] and adopted by the [[League of Nations]] in 1924, and adopted in an extended form by the United Nations in 1959.

==Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1924)==
The text of the document, as published by the [[International Save the Children Union]] in Geneva on 23 February 1923, is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.
#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succoured.
#The child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
#The child must be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
#The child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This text was endorsed by the [[League of Nations]] General Assembly on 26 November 1924 as the World Child Welfare Charter, and was the first human rights document approved by an inter-governmental institution.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Buck, ''International Child Law'' (Routledge, 2014) page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reaffirmed by the League in 1934. Heads of State and Government pledged to incorporate its principles in domestic legislation. In France, it was ordered to be displayed in every school.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Van Bueren, ''The International Law on the Rights of the Child'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original document, in the archives of the city of Geneva, carries the signatures of various international delegates, including Jebb, [[Janusz Korczak]], and [[Gustave Ador]], a former President of the Swiss Confederation.

== History ==
After considering a number of options, including that of drafting an entirely new declaration, the [[United Nations]] resolved in 1946 to adopt the document, in a much expanded version, as its own statement of children's rights. Many different governments were involved in the drafting process. A slightly expanded version, with seven points in place of five, was adopted in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Detrick, J. E. Doek, Nigel Cantwell, The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: A Guide to the "Travaux Préparatoires" (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1992) page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 20 November 1959 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a Declaration of the Rights of the Child, based on the structure and contents of the 1924 original, with ten principles. An accompanying resolution, proposed by the delegation of [[Afghanistan]], called on governments to recognise these rights, strive for their acceptance, and publicise the document as widely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Van Bueren, ''The International Law on the Rights of the Child'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_ARES1386XIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-1386(XIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=14 |resolution_number=1386 |title=Declaration of the Rights of the Child|date=20 November 1959|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This date has been adopted as the [[Universal Children's Day]].

This Declaration was followed in 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], adopted by the UN General Assembly, 
adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989; entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with article 49.

An '''eco-municipality''' or '''eco-town''' is a [[local government]] area that has adopted [[ecological]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]]. The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Spencer (September 22, 2005) [http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 Building Sustainable Cities: Scandinavia's "Eco-Municipalities" Show the Way].sustainablebusiness.com. Retrieved on: November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] and [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. &lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Lahti and Sarah James (May 17, 2005) [http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf The Eco-municipality Model for Sustainable Community Change: A systems approach to creating sustainable communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807163009/http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}.

==History==
In 1983 the [[Övertorneå]] community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).

==Framework==
In becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the [[Natural Step|Natural Step framework]] (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ([[FSSD]])), which sets the following objectives:
* Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels.
* Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals.
* Reduce encroachment upon nature.
* Better meet human needs fairly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Sustainability [http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D Ashland, WI and Duluth, MN become Sustainable Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903103742/http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D |date=2011-09-03 }}.

==Municipalities adopting framework==
Communities in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a [http://www.sekom.se national association of eco-municipalities] to assist one another and work to influence national policy. [[Whistler, BC]], was awarded first place in a [[United Nations]]-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities.

In [[Wisconsin]], there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.&lt;ref&gt;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.

The '''elementary effects (EE) method''' is the most used{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} screening method in [[sensitivity analysis]]. It is applied to identify non-influential inputs for a computationally costly [[mathematical model]] or for a model with a large number of inputs, where the costs of estimating other sensitivity analysis measures such as the variance-based measures is not affordable. Like all screening, the EE method provides qualitative sensitivity analysis measures, i.e. measures which allow the identification of non-influential inputs or which allow to rank the input factors in order of importance, but do not quantify exactly the relative importance of the inputs.

==Methodology==

To exemplify the EE method, let us assume to consider a mathematical model with &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; input factors. Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the output of interest (a scalar for simplicity):

: &lt;math&gt; Y = f(X_1, X_2, ... X_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The original EE method of Morris &lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. D. (1991). Factorial sampling plans for preliminary computational experiments. ''Technometrics'', '''33''', 161–174.&lt;/ref&gt; provides two sensitivity measures for each input factor:

* the measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, assessing the overall importance of an input factor on the model output;
* the measure &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, describing non-linear effects and interactions.

These two measures are obtained through a design based on the construction of a series of trajectories in the space of the inputs, where inputs are randomly moved One-At-a-Time (OAT).
In this design, each model input is assumed to vary across &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; selected levels in the space of the input factors. The region of experimentation &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is thus a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-level grid.

Each trajectory is composed of &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; points since input factors move one by one of a step &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1/(p-1), 2/(p-1),..., 1\}&lt;/math&gt; while all the others remain fixed.

Along each trajectory the so-called ''elementary effect'' for each input factor is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; d_i(X) = \frac{Y(X_1, \ldots ,X_{i-1}, X_i + \Delta, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k ) - Y( \mathbf X)}{\Delta} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, ... X_k)&lt;/math&gt; is any selected value in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; such that the transformed point is still in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; for each index &lt;math&gt; i=1,\ldots, k. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; elementary effects are estimated for each input &lt;math&gt; d_i\left(X^{(1)} \right), d_i\left( X^{(2)} \right), \ldots, d_i\left( X^{(r)} \right) &lt;/math&gt; by randomly sampling &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; points &lt;math&gt; X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \ldots , X^{(r)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Usually &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; ~ 4-10, depending on the number of input factors, on the computational cost of the model and on the choice of the number of levels &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;, since a high number of levels to be explored needs to be balanced by a high number of trajectories, in order to obtain an exploratory sample. It is demonstrated that a convenient choice for the parameters &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; even and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;
p/[2(p-1)]&lt;/math&gt;, as this ensures equal probability of sampling in the input space.

In case input factors are not uniformly distributed, the best practice is to sample in the space of the quantiles and to obtain the inputs values using inverse cumulative distribution functions. Note that in this case &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equals the step taken by the inputs in the space of the quantiles.

The two measures &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; are defined as the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of each input:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{(r-1)} \sum_{j=1}^r \left( d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) - \mu_i \right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

These two measures need to be read together (e.g. on a two-dimensional graph) in order to rank input factors in order of importance and identify those inputs which do not influence the output variability. Low values of both &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; correspond to a non-influent input.

An improvement of this method was developed by Campolongo et al.&lt;ref&gt;Campolongo, F., J. Cariboni, and A. Saltelli (2007). An effective screening design for sensitivity analysis of large models. ''Environmental Modelling and Software'', '''22''',
1509&amp;ndash;1518.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed a revised measure &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt;, which on its own is sufficient to provide a reliable ranking of the input factors. The revised measure is the mean of the distribution of the absolute values of the elementary effects of the input factors:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i^* = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r \left| d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) \right| &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt; solves the problem of the effects of opposite signs which occurs when the model is non-monotonic and which can cancel each other out, thus resulting in a low value for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

An efficient technical scheme to construct the trajectories used in the EE method is presented in the original paper by Morris while an improvement strategy aimed at better exploring the input space is proposed by Campolongo et al..

{{Emotion}}
The study of the '''evolution of emotions''' dates back to the 19th century. [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]] has been applied to the study of [[human communication]], mainly by [[Charles Darwin]] in his 1872 work, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref name ="Darwin2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Darwin|first1= C.|title= The expression of the emotions in man and animals|year= 2007|origyear= 1872|publisher= Filiquarian|location= New York |isbn= 0-8014-1990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darwin researched the expression of [[emotion]]s in an effort to support his theory of evolution.  He proposed that much like other [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s found in animals, emotions also evolved and were adapted over time.&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hess|first1= U.|last2= Thibault|first2= P.|year= 2009|title= Darwin and Emotion Expression|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages= 120–8|pmid= 19203144 |doi= 10.1037/a0013386}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work looked at not only [[facial expression]]s in [[animals]] and specifically [[human]]s, but attempted to point out parallels between [[behavior]]s in humans and other animals.

According to modern evolutionary theory, different emotions evolved at different times. Primal emotions, such as fear, are associated with ancient parts of the brain and presumably evolved among our premammal ancestors. Filial emotions, such as a human mother's love for her offspring, seem to have evolved among early mammals. Social emotions, such as guilt and pride, evolved among social primates. Sometimes, a more recently evolved part of the brain moderates an older part of the brain, such as when the cortex moderates the [[amygdala]]'s fear response. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] consider human emotions to be best adapted to the life our ancestors led in nomadic foraging bands.

==Origins==
Darwin's original plan was to include his findings about expression of emotions in a chapter of his work, ''[[The Descent of Man|The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (Darwin, 1871) but found that he had enough material for a whole book. It was based on [[observations]], both those around him and of people in many parts of the world. One important observation he made was that even in individuals who were born [[Blindness|blind]], body and facial expressions displayed are similar to those of anyone else. The ideas found in his book on [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] of emotions were intended to go against Sir [[Charles Bell|Charles Bell's]] 1844 claim&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bell|first1= C.|title= The anatomy and philosophy of expression as connected with the fine arts|edition= 3|year= 1844|publisher= John Murray|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that human facial [[muscles]] were created to give them the unique ability to express emotions.&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The main purpose of Darwin's work was to support the theory of evolution by demonstrating that emotions in humans and other animals are similar. Most of the similarities he found were between [[species]] closely [[related]], but he found some similarities between distantly related species as well. He proposed the idea that emotional states are adaptive, and therefore only those able to express certain emotions passed on their characteristics.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

===Darwin's principles===
In the 1872 work, Darwin proposed three principles. The first of the three is the "principle of serviceable habits," which he defined as useful habits reinforced previously, and then inherited by offspring. He used as an example contracting of eyebrows (furrowing the brow), which he noted is serviceable to prevent too much light from entering the eyes. He also said that the raising of eyebrows serves to increase the [[field of vision]]. He cited examples of people attempting to remember something and raising their brows, as though they could "see" what they were trying to remember.

The second of the principles is that of [[antithesis]]. While some habits are serviceable, Darwin proposed that some actions or habits are carried out merely because they are opposite in nature to a serviceable habit, but are not serviceable themselves. Shrugging of the shoulders is an example Darwin used of antithesis, because it has no service. Shoulder shrugging is a passive expression, and very opposite of a confident or aggressive expression.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

The third of the principles is expressive habits, or nervous discharge from the nervous system. This principle proposes that some habits are performed because of a build-up to the [[nervous system]], which causes a [[:wikt:discharge|discharge]] of the [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]]. Examples include foot and finger tapping, as well as vocal expressions and expressions of [[anger]]. Darwin noted that many animals rarely make noises, even when in [[pain]], but under extreme circumstances they vocalize in response to pain and [[fear]].&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

==Research==
{{See also|Emotion in animals}}
[[Paul Ekman]] is most noted in this field for conducting research involving facial expressions of emotions. His work provided data to back up Darwin's ideas about universality of facial expressions, even across cultures. He conducted research by showing photographs exhibiting expressions of basic emotion to people and asking them to identify what emotion was being expressed. In 1971, Ekman and Wallace Friesen presented to people in a preliterate culture a story involving a certain emotion, along with photographs of specific facial expressions. The photographs had been previously used in studies using subjects from [[Western cultures]]. When asked to choose, from two or three photographs, the emotion being expressed in the story, the preliterate subjects' choices matched those of the Western subjects most of the time. These results indicated that certain expressions are universally associated with particular emotions, even in instances in which the people had little or no exposure to Western culture. The only emotions the preliterate people found hard to distinguish between were fear and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557 |doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ekman noted that while universal expressions do not necessarily prove Darwin's theory that they evolved, they do provide strong evidence of the possibility.&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P.|year= 1993|title= Facial expression and emotion|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 48|issue= 4|pages= 384–92|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/facial%20expressions/Ekman%201993%20Am%20psych.pdf|pmid= 8512154 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.48.4.384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned the similarities between human expressions and those of other [[primates]], as well as an overall universality of certain expressions to back up Darwin's ideas. The expressions of emotion that Ekman noted as most universal based on research are: anger, fear, [[disgust]], [[sadness]], and [[enjoyment]].&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"/&gt;

A common view is that facial expressions initially served a non-communicative [[adaptive]] function. Thus, the widened eyes in the facial expression of [[fear]] have been shown to increase the visual field and the speed of moving the eyes which helps finding and following threats. The wrinkled nose and mouth of the facial expression of [[disgust]] limit the intake of foul-smelling and possibly dangerous air and particles. Later, such reactions, which could be observed by other members of the group, increasingly become more distinctive and exaggerated in order to fulfill a primarily socially communicative function. This communicative function can dramatically or subtly influence the behavior of other members in the group. Thus, rhesus monkeys or human infants can learn to fear potential dangers based on only the facial expressions of fear of other group members or parents. Seeing fear expressions increases the tendency for flight responses while seeing anger expressions increases the tendency for fight responses. [[Classical conditioning]] studies have found that it is easier to create a pairing between a negative stimulant and anger/fear expressions than between a negative stimulant and a happiness expression. Cross-cultural studies and studies on the congenitally [[Blindness|blind]] have found that these groups display the same expressions of shame and pride in situations related to social status. These expressions have clear similarities to displays of submission and dominance by other primates. Humans viewing expression of pride automatically assign a higher social status to such individuals than to those expressing other emotions.&lt;ref name=Shariff2011/&gt;

The theory is based on the idea that increasing the temperature of portions of the hypothalamus can produce aggressive behavior, whereas cooling can produce relaxation.  Our emotional language has comparable descriptors, such as "hot-head" and "cool-breezy".  The theory offers an explanation for the evolution of common facial expressions of emotion in mammals.  Little experimental work has been done to extend the theory, however.

[[Carroll Izard]], a [[psychologist]] who is known for his work with emotions, discussed gains and losses associated with the evolution of emotions. He said that discrete emotion experiences emerge in ontogeny before language or conceptual structures that frame the qualia known as discrete emotion feelings are acquired. He noted that in evolution, when humans gained the [[wikt:capability|capability]] of expressing themselves with [[language]], which contributed greatly to emotional evolution. Not only can humans [[:wikt:articulate|articulate]] and share their emotions, they can use their experiences to foresee and take appropriate action in future experiences. He did, however, raise the question of whether or not humans have lost some of their [[empathy]] for one another, citing things such as murder and crime against one another as destructive.&lt;ref name="Izard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Izard|first1= C.|year= 2009|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid= 18729725 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539 |pmc= 2723854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph LeDoux]] focuses much of his research on the emotion fear. Fear can be evoked by two systems in the [[brain]], both involving the [[thalamus]] and the [[amygdala]]: one old, short and fast, the other more recently evolved, more circuitous and slower. In the older system, sensory information travels directly and quickly from the thalamus to the amygdala where it elicits the autonomic and motor responses we call fear. In the younger system, sensory information travels from the thalamus to the relevant cortical sensory areas (touch to the somatosensory cortex, vision to the visual cortex, etc.) and on to frontal association areas, where appraisal occurs. These frontal areas communicate directly with the amygdala and, in light of appraisal, may reduce or magnify the amygdala's fear response. If you glimpse what looks like a snake, long before your younger frontal areas have had time to determine it is a stick, the old thalamus-amygdala system will have evoked fear. LeDoux hypothesizes that the old fast system persists because a behavioral response at the first hint of danger is of little consequence when mistaken but may mean the difference between life and death when appropriate.&lt;ref name= LeDoux1998&gt;{{cite book |last1= LeDoux|first1= J|editor1-first= JM|editor1-last= Jenkins|editor2-first= K|editor2-last= Oatley|editor3-first= NL|editor3-last= Stein|title= Human Emotions: A reader|edition= |year= 1998|publisher= [[Blackwell Publishers]]|location= Malden, Massachusetts|isbn= 0-631-20747-3|pages=98–111 |chapter= The emotional brain|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kB19aJKJLoEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=the+emotional+brain+the+mysterious&amp;ots=trmA2l5D2r&amp;sig=XW8_YPeQTeUTz6wxPbbx1MxgAmM#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20emotional%20brain%20the%20mysterious&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeDoux1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ledoux|first1= J.|year= 1996|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid=18729725|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539|pmc=2723854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The doctrine of '''exhaustion of remedies''' prevents a [[litigant]] from seeking a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] in a new [[court]] or [[jurisdiction]] until all [[Cause of action|claim]]s or remedies have been exhausted (pursued as fully as possible) in the original one. The doctrine was originally created by [[case law]] based on the principles of [[comity]].

In the [[United States]], exhaustion of remedies is applied extensively in [[administrative law]]. Many cases are handled first by [[independent agencies of the United States government]] which have primary responsibility for [[Legal case|cases]] involving the [[statute]]s or [[regulation]]s which the agency administers. 

A person's specific rights and duties depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice.  "Exhaustion of administrative remedies" requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then going to a hearing, and finally using the agency's internal appeal process.  Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or "exhausted", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court.  But the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents parties from seeking [[relief]] in the [[court]]s first.

The same process is required under the laws of many, if not all, states.

Exhaustion of remedies frequently affects cases of [[habeas corpus]]. Federal law, for example, prevents a petitioner from seeking federal relief where the [[U.S. state|state]] claims have not yet been exhausted.{{ref|28USC2254}} Generally, the exhaustion requirement permits state courts a "...meaningful opportunity to consider the allegations of legal error." {{ref|vasquez}} 

The issue of exhaustion of remedies in a [[criminal law]] case was before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] in ''[[Harvey v. Horan]]''.

To reach influencer status one should obtain at least 10,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.olapic.com/resources/consumers-follow-listen-trust-influencers_article/|title=Why Consumers Follow, Listen to, and Trust Influencers {{!}} Olapic|work=Olapic {{!}} Visual Commerce &amp; Marketing Platform|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Spring 2017|title=Influencer Isse: Power Girls.

Maxi influencers have more than 20,000 and less than 1 million followers. Mega influencers have more than 1 million followers.

Business magazine [[Forbes]] identified fashion influencers as "the new [[celebrity endorsement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s". However, influencers seem to have a closer relationship with their audience than traditional celebrities. As marketers [[Jung von Matt]], Brandnew IO and Facelift point out: "Daily interactions across multiple channels, through photos, stories or live sessions, create a form of closeness and trust" that make influencers "often more tangible than traditional celebrities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influencer-secrets.com/|title=The Influencer Secrets|website=Influencer Secrets – A Study on the Motivation &amp; Drive of Influencers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Forbes]] named [[Chiara Ferragni]], [[Danielle Bernstein]], Julia Engel, Gabi Gregg, [[Jenn Im]], [[Susanna Lau]], Nicolette Mason, [[Simone Zippi Stardust]], Aimee Song and Bryan Yambao ([[Bryanboy]]) the top influencers in the fashion category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#331e64954552|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the beginning of 2000, [[fashion blog]]s appeared to be amateurish personal areas. They were created as a hobby by fashion lovers to share their ideas of the latest trends or to get a job in the traditional fashion industry later on.&lt;ref name="Spedding"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/meet-fashions-super-influencers-the-women-with-the-power-to-char/|title=Meet fashion's super-influencers: the women with the power to charge £58,000 for one Instagram post|last=Spedding|first=Emma|date=2016-10-06|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing reach, bloggers learned to monetize their contents. As Pedroni remarks: “fashion blogs evolved from personal diaries kept by fashion lovers, into sophisticated marketing and economic tools”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedroni|first=Marco|date=2016|title=Meso-celebrities, fashion and the media: How digital influencers struggle for visibility|url=|journal=Film, Fashion &amp; Consumption|volume=5|pages=103–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, new social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube|Youtube]] spread. They enabled bloggers to reach a greater audience and have an even closer relationship with their existing readership.&lt;ref name="Spedding"/&gt; In fact, some bloggers closed their blogs as traffic moved to other platforms such as Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/what-is-an-influencer|title=What Is An Influencer?|last=Harris|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Emily Hund “Social media’s influencer economy has gained steam quickly in the last few years, particularly on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, whose image-heavy nature easily lends itself to commerce”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hund|first=Emily|date=2017-07-28|title=Measured Beauty: Exploring the aesthetics of Instagram's fashion influencers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097286.3097330|publisher=ACM|pages=44|doi=10.1145/3097286.3097330|isbn=9781450348478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media also gave rise to influencers who did not have a blog in the first place. [[Jenn Im]] became a fashion influencer due to her successful Youtube channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#16bcb9294552),%20Pamela%20Reif%20due%20to%20her%20high%20reach%20on%20Instagram%20(http://aboutpam.com/about|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; German influencer Pamela Reif due to her high reach on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5065754|title=Pamela Reif: Fitness-Model und Instagram-Phänomen|last=Wittershagen|first=Michael|date=2017-06-23|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-02-24|last2=Hamburg|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Instagram was the social media platform with the highest reach for fashion influencers. [[Forbes]] calculated that the top ten fashion influencers combined generated a reach of 23,3 million on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-influencers/fashion/#16bcb9294552|title=Top Influencers of 2017: Fashion|website=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the fashion industry had the highest share on Instagram influencer marketing in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influencer-secrets.com|title=The Influencer Secrets|website=Influencer Secrets – A Study on the Motivation &amp; Drive of Influencers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s share, approximately 61 percent, dominated by far subsequent sectors investing in influencer marketing such as travel (8 percent) and food and drinks (7 percent). The fashion industry spends around €1 billion on sponsored Instagram posts per year.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Business ==
Fashion influencers generate income through brand co-operations and affiliate links.&lt;ref name="Marco 2018"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1013881756|title=Einstieg in das Influencer Marketing : Grundlagen, Strategien und Erfolgsfaktoren|last=Marco|first=Nirschl,|date=2018|others=Steinberg, Laurina|isbn=9783658197452|location=Wiesbaden|oclc=1013881756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principle sources of income are brand co-operations in terms of product placement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fashion influencers are paid to pose with specific products on their social media channels and must mark them correspondingly.

The economic value of a fashion influencer is most commonly measured by number of followers. Other key aspects are demographics of their followers, engagement rate and fit between influencer and brand.&lt;ref name="Marco 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The latter is the necessary precondition for influencers to work with a brand.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; As thousands of people follow them for their authentic personality and style, influencers must be able to identify themselves with the brand in order to recommend it convincingly. Many influencers claim to work exclusively with brands they really like and would recommend in private as well. Influencer Camille Charrière reportedly turned down a 5-digit offer of Macy’s, because she could not identify with the clothes: “At the end of the day, I’m selling my taste and my eye – if I do things off-brand I will lose the respect”.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

=== Benefits for fashion influencers ===
Successful fashion influencers generate an income through their social media activities that enables them to quit their jobs and focus solely on their social media career. German fashion influencer Xenia van der Woodsen (xeniaoverdose) left her full-time job at an investment trust, when she realized that she could earn more money with a single Instagram post than working a full day in a regular job.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/34/xenia-van-der-woodsen-instagram-influencer-geld|title=Xenia van der Woodsen: Über Geld spricht man nicht|last=Levy|first=Sarah|date=2017-08-21|work=Die Zeit|access-date=2018-02-25|language=de-DE|issn=0044-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until fashion influencer Danielle Bernstein spoke out on her mid-six figures income in 2015, financial information about the influencer business were relatively rare and inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Harper's BAZAAR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a10949/how-bloggers-make-money-on-instagram/|title=How Bloggers Make Money On Instagram|date=2015-05-20|work=Harper's BAZAAR|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study of Jung von Matt, Brandnew IO and Facelift revealed that such a high income is relatively rare among influencers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Only eight out of the 1,200 interviewed influencers earn in average between $10,000 – 25,000 per campaign and only three of them more than $25,000. Albeit the “leading fashion influencers in Germany make over one million in revenue each year”, the majority makes less than $1,000 per campaign.

A majority of influencers receive a salary. Solely a minority of 20 percent makes brand co-operations in exchange for giveaways.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The salary primarily depends on the number of followers.&lt;ref name="Harper's BAZAAR"/&gt; The higher the follower number, the higher the salary range. The price for a cooperation depends also on the contract terms, for example if it concerns a one-time Instagram post or a long-term partnership including several posts. Xenia van der Woodsen, one of Germany’s top three fashion influencers in 2017,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; accepts only long-term brand co-operations in the majority of cases.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt; In her experience, posts of long-term campaigns appear more authentic and credible, whereas single paid content pieces stand out as advertisement.

==== Affiliate links ====
Affiliate links enable fashion influencers to earn money on commission. The procedure was introduced by Amber Venz Box in 2011 with her rewardStyle program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sboyd/2014/09/30/rewardstyle-and-liketoknowit-founder-amber-venz-box-is-changing-the-retailing-industr/#77e40fdef11f|title=RewardStyle And LIKEtoKNOWit Founder Amber Venz Box Is Changing The Retailing Industry|last=Boyd|first=Sarah|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; RewardStyle enables selected bloggers to place individual links on their blog posts that lead consumers to a website where they can directly shop the look. If a costumer buys something in the shop, the influencer gets a sales commission. When lots of traffic started to shift to Instagram, this technique did not work anymore, because Instagram did not allow links in post descriptions and images. Bonx created a new app for Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest in 2014 – LIKEtoKNOW.it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-these-3-tech-companies-revamped-their-products-to-improve-the-customer-experience/|title=How These 3 Tech Companies Revamped Their Products to Improve the Customer Experience|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2017, users can take a screenshot of an influencer's picture and LIKEtoKNOW.it delivers the ready-to-shop product details via the app.

=== Benefits for fashion brands ===
Fashion brands use the reach and positive reputation of influencers by implementing [[influencer marketing]]. Influencers spread brand messages, increase brand awareness, contribute to a positive brand image and increase sales by tagging fashion brands in their posts.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Although data that shows the direct correlation between influencer campaigns and sales are rare, the success of affiliate platforms as rewardStyle and successful examples such as the #mangogirls campaign, indicate that influencer engagement affects sales. In the #mangogirls campaign several influencers had independently chosen the same coat as their favorite piece of the Mango collection and showcased it on Instagram.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The coat went viral and sold-out. In fact, first studies show that every third consumer has already bought a product following the recommendation of an influencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171214005418/en/Survey-Consumers-Swayed-Social-Influencers-Purchase-Product|title=Survey: Nearly One Third of Consumers Have Been Swayed by Social Influencers to Purchase a Product or Service|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Fashion influencers have been criticized by journalists for their lack of transparency on [[sponsored post]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/05/social-media-stars-breaching-rules-on-promoting-brands-watchdog-says-instagram-twitter|title=Social media stars breaching rules on promoting brands, watchdog says|last=Marsh|first=Sarah|date=2017-10-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between posts in which influencers share product recommendations for free or because they are paid for it are often blurred.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-14/instagram-to-make-it-clearer-when-influencer-posts-are-paid-ads|title=Instagram to Make It Clearer When Influencer Posts Are Paid Ads|date=2017-06-14|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influencers are supposed to mark a sponsored post with hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored, but often use less-obvious hashtags like #sp or non at all.

Due to this lack of transparency, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) sent out dozens of warning letters to Instagram influencers in the beginning of 2017, giving further indications to influencers and marketers on how to disclose advertising and sponsored posts. Following the rules of the FTC, hashtags like #ad have to appear before the "more" button and are not allowed to be buried in a flood of other hashtags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/04/ftc-staff-reminds-influencers-brands-clearly-disclose|title=FTC Staff Reminds Influencers and Brands to Clearly Disclose Relationship|date=2017-04-18|work=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "anyone endorsing a brand must "clearly and conspicuously" declare connections to it, for example if products have been given free, if a payment has been made for the endorsement or if there is a business or family relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39650580|title=Celebrities warned over Instagram ads|date=2017-04-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in June 2017, Instagram launched a new disclosure system with which users can tag sponsors in a post. If the brand confirms the commercial relation, the post is marked with a "paid partnership" tag at the top&lt;ref name="Bloomberg.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="934">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''first-order predicate''' is a [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] that takes only individual(s) constants or variables as argument(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Dictionary of Philosophy: Revised Second Edition|first=Antony|last=Flew|publisher=Macmillan|year=1984|isbn=9780312209230|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare [[second-order predicate]] and [[higher-order predicate]].

This is not to be confused with a '''one-place predicate''' or monad, which is a predicate that takes only one argument. For example the expression "is a planet" is a one-place predicate, while the expression "is father of" is a '''two-place predicate'''.

In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], there were commonly reckoned to be '''five wits''' and '''five senses'''.&lt;ref name=Furness1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=King Lear|title=Shakespeare|pages=187|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|isbn=9780742652866|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=5|edition=7th|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The five wits were sometimes taken to be synonymous with the five senses,&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&amp;nbsp;but were otherwise also known and regarded as the '''five inward wits''', distinguishing them from the five senses, which were the five ''outward'' wits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|article=wit|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|publisher=Merriam-Webster|date=1991|isbn=9780877796039|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Words|author=[[C. S. Lewis|Clive Staples Lewis]]|edition=2nd (republished)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=9780521398312|pages=147|chapter=Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this conflation has resulted from changes in meaning.  In [[Early Modern English]], "[[wikt:wit#English|wit]]" and "[[wikt:sense#English|sense]]" overlapped in meaning.  Both could mean a faculty of perception (although this sense dropped from the word "wit" during the 17th century).  Thus "five wits" and "five senses" could describe both groups of wits/senses, the inward and the outward, although the common distinction, where it was made, was "five wits" for the inward and "five senses" for the outward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early modern English|author=Charles Laurence Barber|pages=245|chapter=Changes of Meaning|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780748608355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward and outward wits are a product of many centuries of philosophical and psychological thought, over which the concepts gradually developed, that have their origins in the works of [[Aristotle]].  The concept of five outward wits came to medieval thinking from Classical philosophy, and found its most major expression in Christian [[devotional literature]] of the Middle Ages.  The concept of five inward wits similarly came from Classical views on psychology.

Modern thinking is that there are more than five (outward) senses, and the idea that there are five (corresponding to the gross anatomical features &amp;mdash; eyes, ears, nose, skin, and mouth &amp;mdash; of many higher animals) does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.  (For more on this, see [[Sense|Definition of sense]].)  But the idea of five senses/wits from Aristotelian, medieval, and 16th century thought still lingers so strongly in modern thinking that a sense beyond the natural ones is still called a "sixth sense".&lt;ref name=Postgate&gt;{{cite book|title=The outer reaches of life|author=John Raymond Postgate|chapter=Microsenses|pages=165|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780521558730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "inward" wits ==
[[Stephen Hawes]]' poem ''Graunde Amoure'' shows that the five (inward) wits were "common wit", "imagination", "fantasy", "estimation", and "memory".&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  "Common wit" corresponds to Aristotle's concept of the ''[[sensus communis]]'', and "estimation" roughly corresponds to the modern notion of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1964), pp. 162, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare himself refers to these wits several times, in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (Act I, scene 4 and Act II, scene iv), ''[[King Lear]]'' (Act III, scene iv), ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (Act I, scene i, 55), and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act IV, scene ii, 92).&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;  He distinguished between the five wits and the five senses, as can be seen from [[Sonnet 141]].&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backgrounds of Shakespeare's thought|author=John Erskine Hankins|publisher=Archon Books|year=1978|isbn=9780208017437|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mares /&gt;

The five wits are derived from the faculties of the soul that [[Aristotle]] describes in ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;ref name=Mares&gt;{{cite book|title=Much ado about nothing By William Shakespeare|author=Francis Hugh Mares|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521532501|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inward wits are part of medieval psychological thought.  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] translated [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' into Middle English.  According to Chaucer's translation, "ymaginacioun" is the most basic internal faculty of perception.  One can, with the imagination, call to mind the image of an object, either one directly experienced or a purely imaginary fabrication.  Above that comes "resoun", by which such images of individual objects are related to the universal classes to which they belong.  Above that comes "intelligence", which relates the universal classes to eternal "symple forme" (akin to a [[Platonic ideal]]).  Humans are thus "sensible", "ymaginable", and "reasonable" (i.e. capable of sensing, imagination, and reason, as defined), all three of which feed into memory.  (Intelligence is the sole remit of Divine Providence.)&lt;ref name=Kolve&gt;{{cite book|title=Chaucer and the Imagery of Narrative|author=V. A. Kolve|pages=20&amp;ndash;22|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1984|isbn=0-8047-1349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To that quartet is also added "phantasia", a creative facet of imagination.  A famous example of this is given by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who distinguishes between imagining [[Carthage]], from memory (since he had been there), and imagining [[Alexandria]], a pure fantasy image of a place that he had never been to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|align=right|width=30%|source=''The World and the Chylde'', printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] in 1522 and reprinted on page 334 in volume 12 of [[Robert Dodsley]]'s ''Old Plays''&lt;ref name=Furness1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=426|title=The works of William Shakespeare|author=John Payne Collier and Henry R. Cook|volume=VII|location=London|publisher=Whitaker &amp;amp; Co.|year=1843|chapter=King Lear}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The five (outward) senses, as described in [[Cursor Mundi]], are "hering" (hearing), "sight", "smelling" (smell), "fele" (touch) and "cheuing" (taste).&lt;ref name=Postgate /&gt;  It relates them to the five Aristotelian elements (which Aristotle describes in ''[[On the Heavens|De Caelo]]''), with sight coming from fire, hearing from the upper air (the aether), smell from the lower air, taste from water, and touch from earth.  This definition of the origins of human senses was an exceedingly popular one throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, not least because of its rough agreement with chapter 30 of the [[Second Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Southern Version of Cursor Mundi: Lines 1-9228|editor=Sarah M. Horrall|pages=350|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=1978|isbn=9780776648057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "wit" to describe these five senses is illustrated by ''The World and the Chylde'' (at right) and the following two quotations:&lt;ref name=Furness2&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Romeo and Juliet|title=Shakespeare|pages=60|location=Philadelphia|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co.|isbn=9780742652828|author=[[Horace Howard Furness]]|volume=1|edition=10th|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|text=And this knowledge descendeth and cometh of the five corporal senses and wits of the persons, as the eyes, understanding, and hearing of the ears, smell of the nose, taste of the mouth, [&amp;hellip;]|sign=Larke|source=''Book of Wisdom''&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}
{{quote|text=My five wits have I fondly misused and spent, in hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and also feeling, which thou has given me [&amp;hellip;]|sign=''King Henry The Eighth's Primer'', 1546&lt;ref name=Furness2 /&gt;}}

This definition of five senses has its origins in thinkers that came after Aristotle.  Aristotle himself, in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|De Sensu et Sensibilibus]]'' defined ''four'' senses: sight (associated with water because the eye contains water), sound (corresponding to air), smell (corresponding to fire), and touch (corresponding to earth).  Aristotle viewed taste as merely a specialized form of touch, which he in turn viewed as the primary sense (because all life-forms possess it).  He rejected the earlier view by [[Democritus]] that there was in fact only one sense, touch.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|title=Folk-taxonomies in early English|author=Earl R. Anderson|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|year=2003|isbn=9780838639160|chapter=The Five Senses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Plato]], in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', has Socrates stating that there are innumerable senses without names, and that the senses with names include hearing, sight, smell, senses of heat and cold, pleasure, pain, desire, and fear.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

[[Aulus Gellius]] defined five senses, saying "Ex quinque his sensibus quose animantibus natura tribit, visu, auditu, gustu, tactu, odoratu, quas Graeci αισθητεισ appellant" ("Nature has given five senses to living beings, sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell, called αισθητεισ by the Greeks").  But there is no evidence that this [[literary topos|topos]] existed in the thinking of the Anglo-Saxons, since [[Old English]] does not possess the requisite taxonomy, and has difficulty with translations of Latin texts that do.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

The concept of there being five senses occurs in Christian sermons, devotional literature, and religious allegories of [[Middle English]], although not all authors agreed exactly which senses the five were.  [[Peter Damian]] in the 11th century correlated the five wounds that Jesus suffered during his crucifixion with the five senses, which was echoed by [[John Bromyard]] in ''Summa cantium'', although the latter only explicitly mentions hearing, touch, taste, and sight.  By the 14th century, [[Richard Rolle]] was giving the formulation of five senses that is now familiar:&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

{{quote|text=And þus were all þy five wittes occupied with peyne to bote þe trespas of our v witties.  In þy syght þou were blyndfeled, [&amp;hellip;]. In þi smellynge [&amp;hellip;].  In þy tast, [&amp;hellip;].  In hyrynge, [&amp;hellip;].  In felynge, [&amp;hellip;].|sign=[[Richard Rolle]]&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

Chaucer had the same formulation:

{{quote|text=the fyve wittes, that been sighte, herynge, smellynge, tastynge or savourynge, and feelynge|sign=[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]|source=''The Parson's Tale''&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;}}

[[File:Frank Francisco on April 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|Francisco with the New York Mets]]
'''Franklin Thomas Francisco''' (born September 11, 1979) is a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[New York Mets]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].

==Baseball career==
Francisco was originally signed as an amateur [[free agent]] by the [[Boston Red Sox]]. He was traded by the Red Sox to the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 31, {{mlby|2002}}, along with Byeong Hak An, in exchange for reliever [[Bob Howry]]. On July 1, {{mlby|2003}}, the White Sox acquired [[Carl Everett]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in exchange for three players to be named later.

===Texas Rangers===
On July 25, 2003, Francisco, [[Josh Rupe]], and minor leaguer Anthony Webster were sent to the Rangers to complete the trade.

Francisco is best known for participating in a notable incident involving [[List of violent spectator incidents in sports|fan violence]]. On September 13, {{mlby|2004}}, he threw a folding chair into the crowd during a game against the [[Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 Rangers' Francisco arrested for hitting fans with thrown chair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217215057/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 |date=2004-12-17 }}, [[CBS]]. Published September 14, 2004. Retrieved October 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident initially escalated when Rangers pitcher [[Doug Brocail]] confronted a fan. Francisco, who was in the dugout when all this was happening in the bullpen, ran from the dugout to the bullpen and threw a folding chair into the crowd, hitting a female fan in the face, breaking her nose and causing a cut which required stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=esterbook|first1=john|title=Chair-Throwing Pitcher Suspended|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chair-throwing-pitcher-suspended/|website=cbs news|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco was arrested and on June 30, 2005, he pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to the charges. He was sentenced to anger management classes and a work program. A civil suit brought by the woman who had been struck by the chair was settled on January 12, 2007. Terms of the settlement included an undisclosed payment and a public apology.

Francisco was suspended for the balance of the 2004 season, and missed the entire {{mlby|2005}} season after undergoing [[Tommy John surgery]]. Francisco rejoined the club on September 8, {{mlby|2006}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060908&amp;content_id=1652541&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Notes: Francisco excited to be back], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a poor [[spring training]], Francisco started {{mlby|2007}} with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, the [[Oklahoma RedHawks]]. Following an injury to [[Éric Gagné]] in mid-April, Francisco was recalled to the majors. Francisco spent time in {{mlby|2008}} as the Rangers' [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] after an injury to regular closer [[C. J. Wilson (baseball)|C. J. Wilson]].

Francisco again began {{mlby|2009}} as the closer. He began with seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits and one walk, while garnering two saves.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, David. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090421&amp;content_id=4357152&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco solidifying role as closer], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 22, 2009. Retrieved April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the end of April, Francisco maintained a 0.00 ERA with one walk and nine strikeouts, as well as six saves.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090428&amp;content_id=4467092&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco seals Rangers' scrappy win], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 29, 2009. Retrieved May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He allowed his first run of 2009 on an upper-deck home run by Oakland Athletics' second baseman, [[Adam Kennedy]].

Francisco and the Rangers agreed to a one-year contract of $3.265 million, thereby avoiding arbitration for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130201949/http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco lost the closer's role after blowing saves in his first two chances of the [[2010 Texas Rangers season|2010 baseball season]].

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On January 25, 2011, Francisco was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in exchange for catcher [[Mike Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110125&amp;content_id=16499196&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=tw_article_16499196|title=Napoli dealt to Rangers for Francisco|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Stephens|first=Bailey|date=2011-01-25|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, Francisco agreed to terms with the Blue Jays on a one-year contract. After a stint on the disabled list, Francisco made his debut as a Blue Jay on April 20. On his first pitch as a Blue Jay, Francisco gave up a home run to the Yankees' [[Curtis Granderson]].

===New York Mets===
On December 6, 2011, Francisco agreed to a two-year contract worth $12 million with the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/33737135&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Francisco made his Mets debut on April 5, 2012 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and was named the Mets' closer for the 2012 season.

On May 13, 2012, Francisco was ejected from a game against the [[Miami Marlins]] at [[Marlins Park]] after an outburst towards the home plate umpire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mets-bullpen-implodes-8-4-loss-miami-marlins-giancarlo-stanton-hits-grand-slam-9th-inning-article-1.1077411&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2012, after a save against the [[New York Yankees]], Francisco was placed on the 15-day disabled list after feeling soreness in his oblique muscle. Before he began a rehabilitation assignment to come off the DL, Francisco aggravated his injury. On August 22, 2012, Francisco showed frustration by hurling a cooler in the dugout after giving up two runs in the top of the ninth inning. On December 18, 2012, Francisco had surgery to remove a bone spur from his right elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[The Newark Star Ledger]] December 19, 2012. pg. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Розочка белое стекло.jpg|thumb|A broken bottle ready for glassing.]]
'''Glassing''' is a physical attack using a [[Drinking glass|glass]] or [[Beer bottle|bottle]] as a weapon. Glassings can occur at bars or pubs where alcohol is served and such items are readily available. The most common method of glassing involves the attacker smashing an intact glass in the face of the victim. However, the glass may be smashed before the attack, and then gripped by the remaining base of the glass or neck of the bottle with the broken shards protruding outwards. Glassing is easily prevented by using containers made from plastic or [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]] instead, but they suffer from unpleasant feel (plastic) and higher expense (for tempered glass). These alternative containers are slowly being adopted in areas with a high frequency of glassing, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. In New Zealand, a similar phenomenon is referred to as "bottling".

Common injuries resulting from glassings are heavy blood loss, permanent scarring, disfigurement and loss of sight through ocular injury. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year,&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1248571/Shatter-proof-pint-glasses-trialled-pubs-fight-drunken-violence.html |title=Shatter-proof pint glasses to be trialled in pubs to fight drunken violence |work=Daily Mail |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in over 5,000 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calling time on pub pint glasses|work=Manchester Evening News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/22/22330_calling_time_on_pub_pint_glasses.html|date=2002-10-22|author=Ian Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassing is a relatively small portion of all alcohol-related violence, constituting 9% of injuries from alcohol-related violence in New South Wales, from 1999 to 2011, for instance.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-109695.html Alcohol-related violence: Is “glassing” the big issue?], October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tempered glass as policy response ==
{{Further|Tempered glass}}
In 2000, following a series of glassing attacks in [[Manchester]], [[Greater Manchester Police]] and the [[Manchester Evening News]] launched a campaign ''Safe Glass Safe City'' promoting the use of [[toughened glass]] in pubs and clubs to prevent such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modifying Criminogenic Products: What Role for the Government?|journal=Crime Prevention Studies|volume=18|pages=49&amp;ndash;51|author=Ronald V.

===Australia===
At least three states in Australia are addressing glassing incidents by introducing regulations for liquor-licensed venues.

==== New South Wales ====
New South Wales introduced many restrictions in 2008, including the removal of glass after midnight for high-risk venues. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of glassings.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

==== Western Australia ====
In response to glassing violence, the [[government of Western Australia]] in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry on the use of tempered glass in hotels.&lt;ref name="perthnow"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Cordingley |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-leads-in-fight-against-glassing-with-tempered-glassware-in-perth-pubs-and-bars/story-e6frg13u-1226012509118 |title=WA leads in fight against glassing with tempered glassware in Perth pubs and bars |publisher=PerthNow |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of tempered glass in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to tempered beer glasses in six to 12 months.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt; Royal Perth Hospital's head of plastic surgery Mark Duncan-Smith described it as an important step in protecting the public.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt;

==== Queensland ====
In relation to continuing glassing incidents despite limited glass bans in [[Queensland]], Australia, state Liquor Licensing Minister Paul Lucas in 2011 predicted that almost all Queensland pubs and clubs would be (standard) glass-free in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Sandy |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/all-pubs-set-to-become-glass-free/story-fn6ck51p-1226020075518 |title=All pubs set to become glass-free |publisher=The Courier-Mail |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gottfried Helnwein''' (born 8 October 1948) is an Austrian-Irish visual artist. He has worked as a painter, draftsman, photographer, muralist, sculptor, installation and performance artist, using a wide variety of techniques and media.

His work is concerned primarily with psychological and sociological anxiety, historical issues and political topics. His subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, particularly the wounded child, scarred physically and emotionally from within.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flynn Johnson, Curator of the San Francisco Fine Arts Museums, "The Child – Works by Gottfried Helnwein", essay for the catalogue of the one man show at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, {{ISBN|978-0-88401-112-5}}, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His works often reference taboo and controversial issues from recent history, especially the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] and the horror of the [[Holocaust]]. As a result, his work is often considered provocative and controversial.

Helnwein studied at the [[University of Visual Art]] in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, [[Wien]]). He lives and works in Ireland and Los Angeles.

==Life==
Helnwein was born in [[Vienna]] shortly after World War II. His father Joseph Helnwein worked for the Austrian Post and Telegraphy administration (Österreichische Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung), and his mother Margarethe was a housewife.&lt;ref name="sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de"&gt;[http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41113/1/1 Sven Michaelsen, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, ''Ich kann mich in kein System einfügen'', 46/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3384-His-father-Joseph-Helnwein-works-in-the-Austrian-post-administration-and-his-mother-Margarethe-is-a-housewife?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - His father Joseph Helnwein works at the Austrian Post and Telegraph administration, his mother Margarethe is a housewife|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein spent his childhood in a strict Roman Catholic upbringing.  As a student he organized plays and art exhibitions at the  [[Sodality of Our Lady|Catholic Marian Society]] (Marianische Kongregation) of the [[Jesuit Church, Vienna|Jesuit University Church in Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3382-Strict-Roman-Catholic-upbringing?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Strict Roman Catholic upbringing|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_3379-First-year-at-school-with-the-Roman-Catholic-School-Brothers?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - First year at school with the Roman Catholic "School-Brothers"|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1965 he enrolled at the  "Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation" in Vienna (Höhere Bundes-Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, Wien).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_878-1965-to-1969-Studies-at-the-Higher-Federal-Institution-for-Graphic-Education-and-Experimentation-in-Vienna-?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - 1965 to 1969  Studies at the "Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation" in Vienna|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years he started his first performances for small audiences where he cut his face and hands with razor blades and bandaged himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_1012-First-Aktions-for-small-audiences?s=1192&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - First "Aktions" for small audiences|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 to 1973 he studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Wien).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_879-1969-to-1973-Helnwein-studies-painting-at-the-Academy-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vienna?s=1191&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Helnwein studies at the University of Visual Art in Vienna (Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Wien).|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Helnwein met [[Andy Warhol]] in his [[The Factory|Factory]] in New York City, who posed for a series of photo-sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/artist/biography/article_994-Helnwein-meets-with-Andy-Warhol-at-his-factory-in-New-York-?s=1190&amp;sg=171|title=Gottfried Helnwein - ARTIST - Biography - Helnwein meets with Andy Warhol at his factory in New York|first=Gottfried|last=Helnwein|website=www.helnwein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein was offered a chair by the University of Applied Sciences in [[Hamburg]] in 1982.  When his demand to admit also children to study at the university was rejected, he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Andreas Mackler talks with Gottfried Helnwein, 13. / 14. July and 21. / 22.

In 1985 [[Rudolf Hausner]], recommended Helnwein as his successor as professor of the master-class for painting at the University of Visual Art in Vienna, but Helnwein left Vienna and moved to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hufnagel, Kurier, Wien, ''Akademie: Helnwein als Professor-ein Schock?'', Interview with Gottfried Helnwein, 13. Feb. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

He bought a medieval castle close to [[Cologne]] and the [[Rhine]]-river.  Four years later in 1989 he established a studio in [[Tribeca]] New York and thenceforth spent his time between the United States and Germany.&lt;ref name="sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Conrad III, San Francisco Chronicle, ''German Portraits of Pain, Gottfried Helnwein reminds Society of it's Past'', 9 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Helnwein moved to [[Dublin]], Ireland in 1997 and one year later, he bought [[Castle Gurteen de la Poer]] in [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Tipton, Irish Times, ''Fantasy and Reality in one Place’’, 4 June 2016 [http://www.helnwein.com/press/international_press/article_5765-Fantasy-and-Reality-in-one-Place helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 he established a studio in downtown Los Angeles and he lives and works since then in Ireland and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynell George, Los Angeles Times, ''Gottfried Helnwein - Dark Inspirations’’, 30 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2005, his friend [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Dita Von Teese]] were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at Helnwein's castle.&lt;ref&gt;Maeve Quigley, "Rocker ties Knot with Dita", ''Sunday Mirror'', UK, 4 December 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060828055104/http://www.gottfriedhelnwein.ie/country/ireland_special/artikel_2470.html Gottfried Helnwein | IRELAND | Ireland Special | ROCKER TIES KNOT WITH DITA]&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]&lt;ref&gt;''People magazine'', "Marilyn Manson Marries Girlfriend in Ireland", 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Gottfried Helnwein was [[best man]] &lt;ref&gt;The wedding ceremony, Dita and Manson at Castle De la Poer, Ireland 2005, Alejandro Jodorowsky officiates at the wedding, Helnwein is best man, www.helnwein.com [http://www.helnwein.com/kuenstler/atelier/bild_3713.html Gottfried Helnwein | ARTIST | Studio | Wedding ceremony, Dita and Manson at Castle De la Poer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamish Bowles, Steven Klein, "The Bride Wore Purple", [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], pages 546–556, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Helnwein is part of a tradition going back to the 18th century, to which [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt's]] grimacing sculptures belong. One sees, too, the common ground of his works with those of [[Arnulf Rainer]] and [[Hermann Nitsch]], two other Viennese, who display their own bodies in the frame of reference of injury, pain, and death. And one sees how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of [[Egon Schiele]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Recht, '{{lang|de|Der [[Untermensch]]}}', Gottfried Helnwein, one-man show, Musée d’Art Moderne, Strasbourg, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Child===
[[File:helnwein state russian museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|State [[Russian Museum]] St. Petersburg, Helnwein's ''Head of a Child'' ({{lang|de|"Kindskopf"}}, 1991, oil and acrylic on canvas, 600 x 400&amp;nbsp;cm), being installed in the retrospective of Gottfried Helnwein, 1997, (Collection of the State Russian Museum St. Petersburg)]]

Helnwein's early work consists mainly of hyper-realistic watercolors, depicting wounded children, as well as photographs and performances – often with children – in public spaces. The bandaged child became the most important figure next to the artist himself allied with him in his actions: the embodiment of the innocent, defenceless individual at the mercy of brute force.

Art historian Peter Gorsen specified the relation between Helnwein's work and [[Viennese Actionism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Helnwein must be set apart from Viennese Actionism as he does not reduce the child's body to mere aesthetic material (as in the "material actions" of [[Günter Brus]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], and [[Otto Muehl]]), but instead endows it with a symbolic function in representing defenceless, sacrificed man. The sexualistic concept of the child in ([[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]-influenced) Viennese Actionism is countered by the moralist and utopian Helnwein with the child as a sexless salvation figure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, "The Divided Self – Gottfried Helnwein in his Self-Portraits", "Der Untermensch", Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, The [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] organized the first one-person exhibition of Gottfried Helnwein at an American Museum: "The Child, works by Gottfried Helnwein" at the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nirmala Nataraj, "Gottfried Helnwein's The Child – Innocence Lost", ''SF Station'', San Francisco, 15 August 2004 [http://www.sfstation.com/gottfried-helnweins-the-child-a9 Gottfried Helnwein's The Child | SF Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry S. Parker III, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Helnwein, the child is the symbol of innocence, but also of innocence betrayed. In today's world, the malevolent forces of war, poverty, and sexual exploitation and the numbing, predatory influence of modern media assault the virtue of children.  Helnwein's work concerning the child includes paintings, drawings, and photographs, and it ranges from subtle inscrutability to scenes of stark brutality.
Of course, brutal scenes – witness The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] – have been important and regularly visited motifs in the history of art. What makes Helnwein's art significant is its ability to make us reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses. Many people feel that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.
The Child: Works by Gottfried Helnwein will inspire and enlighten many; it is also sure to upset some. It is not only the right but the responsibility of the museum to present art that deals with important and sometimes controversial topics in our society".&lt;ref&gt;Harry S.Parker III, Director of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, "The Child – Works by Gottfried Helnwein", Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show was seen by almost 130,000 visitors and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' quoted it the most important exhibition of a contemporary artist in 2004.
Steven Winn, ''Chronicle'' Arts and Culture critic, wrote: "Helnwein's large format, photo-realist images of children of various demeanors boldly probed the subconscious. Innocence, sexuality, victimization and haunting self-possession surge and flicker in Helnwein's unnerving work".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Winn, Chronicle Arts and Culture Critic, "Critics Choices 2004, Top Ten", ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', 26 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self portraits===
At the same time when Helnwein painted watercolors of injured and abused children, from 1969, around 1970/71 he also began a series of self-portrayals in photographs and performances (actions) in his studio and in the streets of Vienna. 
Actionistic self-portrayals in the manner of a happening featuring his injured and bandaged body and surgical instruments deforming his face go back to Helnwein's student days. Since then, bandages have become part of the aesthetic "uniform" of his self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, ''Die Verwandlungskunst des Doppelgängers - zu den Selbstbildnissen bei Gottfried Helnwein'', ‘Der Untermensch’, Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, J&amp;V Verlag, Wien,  January 1988. {{ISBN|3-925835-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist exposed himself as victim and martyr: bandages around his head and forks and surgical instruments piercing his mouth or cheek. Frequently the distortions of these tormented images make it difficult to recognize Helnwein's face. He appears as a screaming man, mirroring the frightening aspects of life: a twentieth-century [[Man of Sorrows]]. His frozen cry, showing the artist in a state of implacable trauma, recalls [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''Scream'' and [[Francis Bacon]]'s screaming popes. 
Some of Helnwein's grimacing faces also recall the grotesque physiognomic distortions by the eighteenth-century Viennese sculptor Franz Xavier Messerschmidt. They could also be seen as part of the Austrian pictorial tradition that resurfaced in the perturbed and distorted expressionist faces painted by [[Kokoschka]] and Egon Schiele before World War I, reappearing in the exaggerated mimicry in Arnulf Rainer's "Face Farces."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selz, ''Helnwein - The Artist as Provocateur'', The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Palace Edition 1997,  pp. 11–98, {{ISBN|5900872556}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[William S. Burroughs]]  commented on Helnwein's self-portraits in an essay in 1992:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a basic misconception that any given face, at any given time, looks more or less the same, like a statue's face. Actually, the human face is as variable from moment to moment as a screen on which images are reflected, from within and from without.
Gottfried Helnwein's paintings and photographs attack this misconception, showing the variety of faces of which any face is capable. And in order to attack the basic misconception, he must underline and exaggerate by distortion, by bandages and metal instruments that force the face into impossible molds. Images of torture and madness abound, as happens from moment to moment in the face seen as a sensitive reflection of extreme perceptions and experience. How can a self-portrait depict statuesque calm in the face of the horrors that surround us all?&lt;ref&gt;William S. Burroughs, "Helnwein's Work",1990.''Helnwein Faces'', 1992 Edition Stemmle. {{ISBN|3-7231-0427-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central importance of the "self-portrait" in Helnwein's work, the mutable art of a [[doppelgänger]], is no accident. It becomes the projection surface of world events. "The artist doesn't make history, history makes him" ([[Auguste Comte]]). The artist's doppelgänger role as victim and perpetrator, martyr and [[satyr]], penitent and accuser, proxy and self-portrayer, moralist and autist, and in many other metamorphoses embodies and stages the antagonistic social forces on a stage of his inner-world consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gorsen, ''Die Verwandlungskunst des Doppelgängers - zu den Selbstbildnissen bei Gottfried Helnwein'', ‘Der Untermensch’, Verlag Braus, Heidelberg, 1988. {{ISBN|3-925835-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation with Robert A. Sobieszek, curator of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], Helnwein declared:
"The reason why I took up the subject of self-portraits and why I have put myself on stage was to function as a kind of representative for the suffering, abused and oppressed human being. I needed a living body to demonstrate and exemplify the effect of violence inflicted upon a defenseless victim.
There is nothing autobiographical or therapeutical about it, and I don’t think it says anything about me personally. 
Also I was the best possible model for my experiments: endlessly patient and always available."&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Sobieszek, ''Ghost in the Shell'', Photography and the Human Soul, 1850-2000, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics and trivial art===
Another strong element in his works are comics. Helnwein has sensed the superiority of [[cartoon]] life over real life ever since he was a child. Growing up in a dreary, destroyed post-war [[Vienna]], the young boy was surrounded by unsmiling people, haunted by a recent past they could never speak about. What changed his life was the first German-language [[Donald Duck]] comic book that his father brought home one day. Opening the book felt like finally arriving in a world where he belonged:&lt;br/&gt;
"...a decent world where one could get flattened by steam-rollers and perforated by bullets without serious harm. A world in which the people still looked proper, with yellow beaks or black knobs instead of noses." (Helnwein&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, "Memories of [[Duckburg]]", translation from German: "{{lang|de|Micky Maus unter dem roten Stern}}", ''Zeit-Magazin'', Hamburg, 12.May.1989. [http://www.helnwein.com/texte/selected_authors/artikel_398.html Gottfried Helnwein | TEXTS | Selected Authors | MEMORIES OF DUCKBURGAmerican Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Petra Halkes, "A Fable in Pixels and Paint – Gottfried Helnwein's American Prayer". Image &amp; Imagination, Le Mois de la Photo à Montréal, ''McGill-Queen's University Press'', 2005 ({{ISBN|978-0-7735-2969-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] presented Helnwein's painting "Mouse I" (1995, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210&amp;nbsp;cm x 310&amp;nbsp;cm) at the exhibition ''The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection''.&lt;br/&gt;
Alicia Miller commented on Helnwein's work in ''Artweek'':
"In 'The Darker Side of Playland', the endearing cuteness of beloved toys and cartoon characters turns menacing and monstrous. Much of the work has the quality of childhood nightmares. In those dreams, long before any adult understanding of the specific pains and evils that live holds, the familiar and comforting objects and images of a child's world are rent with something untoward. For children, not understanding what really to be afraid of, these dreams portend some pain and disturbance lurking into the landscape.
Perhaps nothing in the exhibition exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein's '[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as [[Mr. Hyde]], his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.
Helnwein's Mickey is painted in shades of gray, as if pictured on an old black-and-white TV set. We are meant to be transported to the flickering edges of our own childhood memories in a time imaginably more blameless, crime-less and guiltless. But Mickey's terrifying demeanor hints of things to come...".&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Miller, "The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection at SFMOMA", ''Artweek'', US, 1 November 2000. [http://www.helnwein.com/presse/local_press/artikel_272.html Gottfried Helnwein | PRESS | English Press | 'THE DARKER SIDE OF PLAYLAND: CHILDHOOD IMAGERY FROM THE LOGAN COLLECTION' AT SFMOMASFMOMA San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Helnwein's work is rooted in the legacy of [[German expressionism]], he has absorbed elements of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: "I learned more from [[Donald Duck]] than from all the schools that I have ever attended." Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein's work, [[Julia Pascal]] wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'': "His early watercolor ''Peinlich'' (''Embarrassing'')&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, ''Peinlich'', color pencil, india-ink, and watercolor on cardboard, 60 x 35cm, 1971 [http://www.helnweincomic.homestead.com/worksonpaper.html comic-helnwein]&lt;/ref&gt; shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book. Her innocent appeal is destroyed by the gash deforming her cheek and lips. It is as if Donald Duck had met [[Mengele]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julia |last=Pascal|authorlink=Julia Pascal|title= Nazi Dreaming|work= New Statesman, UK|date= 10 April 2006 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/164076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living between Los Angeles and Ireland, Helnwein met and photographed the [[Rolling Stones]] in London, and his portrait of [[John F. Kennedy]] made the front cover of [[Time magazine]] on the 20th anniversary of the president's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine Cover: John F. Kennedy, by Gottfried Helnwein, ''Time'' magazine, Vol. 122 No. 21, 14 November 1983 [http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19831114,00.html TIME Magazine Cover: John F.

Among his widely published works is a spoof of the famous [[Edward Hopper]] painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'', entitled ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'', depicting Elvis Presley, Marylin Monroe, James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. This painting also inspired the [[Green Day]] [[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|song]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Green Day: "American Idiots &amp; the New Punk Explosion", ''The Disinformation Company'', 2006, (Page 198), ({{ISBN|978-1-932857-32-0}}) [http://www.helnwein.com/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_2861.html Gottfried Helnwein | ARTIST | Bibliography | GREEN DAY: AMERICAN IDIOTS &amp; THE NEW PUNK EXPLOSION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining his imagery from the 1970s to the present, one sees influences as diverse as [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Goya]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Beuys]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], all filtered through a [[postwar]] Viennese childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Pascal, "Nazi Dreaming", ''New Statesman'', UK, 10 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 'Helnwein's oeuvre embraces total antipodes: The trivial alternates with visions of spiritual doom, the divine in the child contrasts with horror-images of child-abuse. But violence remains to be his basic theme – the physical and the emotional suffering, inflicted by one human being unto another.'&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fuller, {{lang|de|"Endzeit-Stimmung – Düstere Bilder in Goldener Zeit"}}, ''Du Mont Publishing House'', Cologne, 1994.

===References to the Holocaust===
[[File:Gh293.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Gottfried Helnwein, ''Epiphany I (Adoration of the Magi)'', mixed media on canvas, 1996]]
1988 in remembrance of [[Kristallnacht]] (Cristal Night) 50 years earlier, Helnwein erected a large installation in the city center of Cologne, between [[Ludwig Museum]] and the [[Cologne Cathedral]]: ''Selektion – Neunter November Nacht ("Selektion – Ninth November Night)''
A four-meter-high, hundred-meter-long picture lane in which the artist recalls the events of Reichskristallnacht, the actual beginning of the Holocaust, on 9 November 1938. He confronts the passersby with larger-than-life children's faces lined up in a seemingly endless row, as if for concentration camp selection. Just days into the exhibit, these portraits were vandalized by unknown persons, symbolically cutting the throats of the depicted children's faces. Helnwein consciously left the panels with the gashes and included them into the presentation, because he decided it made the work stronger and more relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Mischke, "Aefflinge und Tschandalen", ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 11. October 1988. [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/presse/selected_articles/artikel_213.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal, "Thoughts", Ninth November Night, Installation by Gottfried Helnwein, 09. November 1988 [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/texte/selected_authors/artikel_119.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell Waxman wrote 2004, in ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]'', Los Angeles: "The most powerful images that deal with Nazism and [[Holocaust]] themes are by [[Anselm Kiefer]] and Helnwein, although, Kiefer's work differs considerably from Helnwein's in his concern with the effect of German aggression on the national psyche and the complexities of German cultural heritage. Kiefer is known for evocative and soulful images of barren German landscapes. But Kiefer and Helnwein's work are both informed by the personal experience of growing up in a post-war German speaking country...
[[William Burroughs]] said that the American revolution begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein's art might have the capacity to instigate change by piercing the veil of political correctness to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Waxman, "The Helnwein Epiphany", ''The Jewish Journal'', Los Angeles, 23 July 2004 [http://kristallnacht.helnwein.com/en_US/presse/local_press/artikel_1746.html kristallnacht.helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known paintings of Helnwein's oeuvre is [[Epiphany (holiday)|''Epiphany I'']] – ''Adoration of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]'', (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210&amp;nbsp;cm x 333&amp;nbsp;cm, collection of the Denver Art Museum).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Grovier, Art since 1989, Thames &amp; Hudson, World of Art, London, 2015, {{ISBN|9780500204269}} [http://www.helnwein.com/artist/bibliography/article_5680-Art-since-1989?s=1159&amp;sg=166 helnwein.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a series of three paintings: ''Epiphany I'', ''Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds)'', ''Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple)'', created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. [[Julia Pascal]] wrote about this work in the New Statesman: "This Austrian Catholic [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen [[SS]] officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary's lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas." Helnwein's baby Jesus is often considered to represent [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helnwein.com/presse/local_press/artikel_2630.html Julia Pascal, "Nazi Dreaming", ''New Statesman'', UK, 10 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works for the stage===
Helnwein is also known for his stage and costume designs for theater, ballet and opera productions. Amongst them: "[[Macbeth]]" by [[William Shakespeare]], (director, choreographer: [[Johann Kresnik]]), Theater [[Heidelberg]], 1988, [[Volksbühne]] Berlin, 1995; "[[Marat/Sade|The Persecution and Murder of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade]]" by [[Peter Weiss]], (director: Johann Kresnik), [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|Stuttgart National Theatre]], 1989; "[[Pasolini]], Testament des Körpers", (director: Johann Kresnik), [[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]] [[Hamburg]], 1996; "Hamletmaschine" by [[Heiner Müller]], (director: Gert Hof), 47.

* 1971 First public Aktions in the streets of Vienna, often with bandaged children (Aktion ''Sorgenkind'', Aktion ''Hallo Dulder'', Aktion ''Eternal Youth'', Aktion ''Sandra'').&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Helnwein, Aktion ''Sorgenkind'', Vienna, 1972, Works, www.helnwein.com [http://www.helnwein.com/werke/aktionen/bild_563.html Gottfried Helnwein | WORKS | Installations and Performances | Aktion Sorgekind]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the exhibition "Zoetus" at the Kunsthalle "Künstlerhaus" in Vienna, unidentified people put stickers with the words "[[Entartete Kunst]]" ([[degenerate art]]) on Helnwein's paintings.
* At the opening of a one-man show at Galerie D. in Moedling, near Vienna, the Major has Helnwein's Artworks confiscated by the police.
* 1972 An exhibition at the {{lang|de|"Galerie im Pressehaus"}} (Gallery of the House of the Press) is closed after 3 days because of strong protests and threats by the works council.
* 1979 Spurred into action by an interview in an Austrian tabloid in which the country's top court psychiatrist, Dr [[Heinrich Gross]], admitted killing children at Vienna's ''{{lang|de|[[Am Spiegelgrund]]}}'' Pediatric Unit during the war by poisoning their food, Helnwein painted ''Life not Worth Living'' – a watercolour of a little girl "asleep" on the table, her head in her plate. The painting was published in Austria's leading newsmagazine ''Profil'' and sparked a nationwide debate that finally led to Gross' appearing before a Vienna court. The judge ruled Gross was mentally unfit to be tried.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Connolly, "Helnwein, the man who used his own blood to paint Hitler", ''The Guardian'', UK, 16 May 2000 [http://www.helnwein.com/presse/international_press/artikel_19.html Gottfried Helnwein | PRESS | International Press | GOTTFRIED HELNWEIN, THE MAN WHO USED HIS OWN BLOOD TO PAINT HITLER] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031074618/http://www.helnwein.com/presse/international_press/artikel_19.html |date=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1985 One man show at the [[Albertina, Vienna]].
* Besides his realistic work, Helnwein also began to develop abstract, expressive styles of painting during this period. He radically changes his way of working and now begins a series of large-format pictures consisting of several parts (diptychs, triptychs, poliptychs). In doing so he combines photomurals with abstract gestural and [[monochrome painting]] in oil and acrylic, also using reproductions of [[Caspar David Friedrich]] paintings and war documentary photographs which he assembles to form what Viennese art-critic Peter Gorsen calls "Bilderstrassen" (picture lanes).

"Arm the teachers," the company declared on Facebook. "In the meantime, bulletproof the kids... The question may be political, but the keenest response is to be found in a museum in Mexico City, the Museo Nacional de San Carlos, at a retrospective of paintings and photographs by the Austrian-American artist Gottfried Helnwein. Helnwein's extraordinary work depicts the fragile innocence of children. Devoid of grown-up sentimentalism, his images can be overwhelming, especially those that show how that innocence falters in an adult world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2012/12/28/the-true-impact-of-violence-on-childhood-why-every-american-ought-to-see-the-paintings-of-gottfried-helnwein/|title=The True Impact of Violence On Childhood?

==Quotes==
[[William Burroughs]] said of Helnwein:
:"It is the function of the artist to evoke the experience of surprised recognition: to show the viewer what he knows but does not know that he knows. Helnwein is a master of surprised recognition."&lt;ref&gt;"Helnwein Faces", 1992, Edition Stemmle, Switzerland, pages 6–7, {{ISBN|978-3-7231-0427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Helnwein is one of the few exciting painters we have today.''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Norman Mailer]]&lt;ref&gt;From a letter by Norman Mailer to Helnwein's wife Renate, written in Provincetown,
Massachusetts, 23 June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

''Well, the world is a haunted house, and Helnwein at times is our tour guide through it. In his work he is willing to take on the sadness, the irony, the ugliness and the beauty. But not all of Gottfried's work is on a canvas. A lot of it is the way he's approached life. And it doesn't take someone knowing him to know that. You take one look at the paintings and you say "this guy has been around." You can't sit in a closet – and create this. This level of work is earned.''&lt;br/&gt;[[Sean Penn]]&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Sean Penn in the documentary "Ninth November Night", a Film about Gottfried Helnwein and his Installation for the 50. Anniversary of "Kristallnacht" at Ludwig Museum in Cologne, 1988 and other references to the Holocaust in his Work. Director Henning Lohner, Los Angeles 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gottfried Helnwein is my mentor. His fight for expression and stance against oppression are reasons why I chose him as an artistic partner. An artist that doesn't provoke will be invisible. Art that doesn't cause strong emotions has no meaning. Helnwein has that internalized.''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Marilyn Manson]]&lt;ref&gt;"Ich bin Amerikas Alptraum", Interview by Christoph Dallach, Jörg Böckem, ''Der Spiegel'', Hamburg, 5 May 2003, page 178, [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-27007551.html?name=Ich+bin+Amerikas+Alptraum DER SPIEGEL&amp;nbsp;19/2003 – Ich bin Amerikas Alptraum]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Helnwein's subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, but not the carefree innocent child of popular imagination. Helnwein instead creates the profoundly disturbing yet compellingly provocative image of the wounded child. The child scarred physically and the child scarred emotionally from within.''&lt;br/&gt;
Robert Flynn Johnson, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;"The Child – Works by Gottfried Helnwein", The Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, 2004, pages 9–23, {{ISBN|978-0-88401-112-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Martin Sutermeister''' (29 September 1907  – 4 May 1977 pen name: Hans Moehrlen) was a [[Swiss]] [[physician]] and [[medical writer]], [[politician]], and activist against [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]].

==Life==

===Early years===
Hans Martin was born to Freidrich Sutermeister (1873-1934) and Maria Hunziker (1875-1947). His brothers include the writer [[Peter Sutermeister|Peter]] and composer [[Heinrich Sutermeister|Heinrich]].  His grandfather was the folklorist [[Otto Sutermeister]]. A minister's son, Hans Martin studied [[theology]] in Germany, changing to medicine at [[University of Basel]] just before completing his degree.&lt;ref name=Mauz&gt;Gerhard Mauz. [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46272426.html “Schuldig, weil wir keinen anderen haben: SPIEGEL-Reporter Gerhard Mauz über die Fehlurteilsjäger Hans Martin Sutermeister und Gustav Adolf Neumann.”] In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 18/28, April 1965, p. 116 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[Doctorate|promotion]] with his uncle [[Hans Hunziker]] in 1941, Sutermeister published, under the pseudonym “Hans Moehrlen” (following the surname of his great-grandfather [[Christophe Moehrlen]]), an autobiographical novella about his life as a [[bachelor]]. The novella describes his philosophical change of direction towards a [[monism|monist]] view of love and happiness, inspired by natural science; remarkably is its heartedness in times of [[World War II|war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Sutermeister published a series on [[neopositivism|neopositivist]] medical thought. He was especially interested in [[psychosomatic]] medicine and [[music psychology]]. For example, according to him, “[[swing music]] is restful” because &lt;blockquote&gt;the brain becomes fatigued when it is worked too hard, as in acquiring knowledge of new facts. Both students and business men can benefit by such music … the best way to rest the brain after such fatigue is to “[[Regression (psychology)|regress]]” to more basic or primitive forms of thought and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=efUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=%22Dr.+H+M+Sutermeister%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NgZNnKKMrS&amp;sig=CZX48jDsCLA85cDWrtf2CTnK3wA&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=tNzBTKzPE8KaOtT9yMoL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dr.%20H%20M%20Sutermeister%22&amp;f=false “Swiss Says Swing Smoothly Soothes.”] In: ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', January 17, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During [[World War II]], he worked for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] in Germany, [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], as well as a physician at the Swiss border. After the war he wrote for medical journals and was an instructor in [[psychophysiology]] at the [[Volkshochschule]] (Folk high school) in [[Bern]]. In 1945, he opened his first a [[family medicine|family medical]] practice in Bern.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In order to get a [[venia legendi]] in [[History of Medicine]] and [[Medical Psychology]] (Psychosomatics), Sutermeister successively deposited, at the beginning of the 1950s, three [[Habilitation|post-doctoral theses]] at the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Berne]]:&lt;ref name="klaesi"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/JakobKlaesiToBernhardWalthard6.9.1954 ''Betrifft Habilitationsgesuch des Dr. med.

Sutermeister was in contact with the medical historian [[Erich Hintzsche]] particularly because of his work ''Schiller as physician'', and he participated in a seminar on medical history 1953 in Lugano. In a letter to Hintzsche, [[Henry E. Sigerist]] described Sutermeister's review, published in 1955 as Volume 13 of the ''Berne contributions to the history of medicine and natural sciences'', as “a very nice work … that is interesting even to [[literary historian]]s.”&lt;ref name="bickel"&gt;[[Marcel H.

Pages 378 and 572–574. {{ISBN|978-3-03911-499-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessor [[Jakob Klaesi]] recommended to the Dean of the Faculty [[Bernhard Walthard]] to allow Sutermeister's habilitation allow for the government to issue Sutermeister's habilitation as a lecturer in Medicine history and Psychosomatic medicine.&lt;ref name="klaesi" /&gt; Hintzsche, however, who decided jointly, rejected his habilitation.&lt;ref name="bickel" /&gt;

===Politics===

He joined the [[Ring of Independents]] political party and began his political career in the [[Grand Council of Bern|legislature of the Canton of Bern]]. From 1967 to 1971 he served as a member of the municipal [[Executive (government)|executive]], as well as director of the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bähler |first=Anna |author2=Bühler, Susanna |author3=Erne, Emil |author4=Lüthi, Christian |editor=Barth, Robert |title=Bern - die Geschichte der Stadt im 19. und 20.

Although he had a reputation as a progressive within his party, he also stirred some concern both inside and outside the party&lt;ref name=anneepolitique&gt;[http://www.anneepolitique.ch/APS/fr/APS_1971/APS1971_I_1_e.html Élections communales, année politique Suisse 1971], University of Bern (French - password required): ''A Berne, lors des élections à l'exécutif communal, les radicaux, grâce à A.

Thiele-Dohrmann, [http://www.zeit.de/1970/30/Ruhestoerung-in-Bern?page=all “Ruhestörung in Bern.”]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Die Zeit]]'' July 24, 1970 (German): ''in einem kleinen Privatkrieg heftig attackiert''.&lt;/ref&gt; an educational manifesto deriving from the [[Protests of 1968|1968 student protest movement]] that urged students to reject societal norms. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' quoted his warning to all educators: &lt;blockquote&gt;We will not permit our youth, who are today still healthy, and our freedom-based Western culture, to be undermined by such softening-up tactics, which are clearly controlled from the East, and made 'Ready for conquest' by Communism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44943670.html “Der SPIEGEL berichtete: Schüler-Lehrerbeziehung.”] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 28/1970, July 6, 1970: ''Wir lassen uns unsre heute noch gesunde Jugend und unsre freiheitliche westliche Kultur nicht durch solche eindeutig vom Osten gesteuerte Aufweichungstaktik unterminieren und “sturmreif” für den Kommunismus machen.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and added that some schools banned the book; Radio Bern canceled a broadcast on it; and bookstores canceled orders; the city authorities determined that the book was not seditious, but with police assurance that they had the power to do so, banned it as posing a danger to minors. His actions revealed latent attitudinal and generational divisions within the party, and he was not re-elected in 1971.&lt;ref name=anneepolitique/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.memoriav.ch/memobase/search/detail.aspx?docid=RJSFDRS_93077691&amp;startrank=1&amp;rankcount=9726 see also]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he opened his new family medical practice in Basel.

===Activism against miscarriages of justice===

[[File:Hans Martin Sutermeister 1971.jpg|thumb|upright|Of the [[Swiss Posters Collection]]: Sutermeister's election poster for the Bernese [[Gemeinderat (Bern)|Gemeinderat]], 1971.]]

In the 1960s, Sutermeister became interested in [[forensic pathology]], and began to involve himself in investigating and attempting to right miscarriages of justice. He traveled widely and wrote analyses on false recognition, intimidation by prison inmates, uncritical acceptance of expert testimony, suggestibility and emotionalism in jurors and psychological errors by judges. His book ''Summa Iniuria'', which treats hundreds of cases, is one of the most thorough German-language works in the field. He concerned himself particularly with the case of [[Jaccoud case|Pierre Jaccoud]], whom he was convinced had been wrongly convicted of murdering Charles Zumbach based on faulty forensic work. At one point Pierre Hegg, the head of the police criminological laboratory, sued him for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43067286.html "Ein gewisses Lächeln"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 45/1960, 2 November 1960, p. 71 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts on behalf of Jaccoud made him a prominent and effective opponent of courtroom injustice,&lt;ref name=Mauz/&gt; and he went so far as to assemble the funds to hire Horace Mastronardi and other lawyers to appeal Jaccoud's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Thorwald]], ''Blutiges Geheimnis'', Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1969, {{OCLC|159809005}}, pp. 257-58 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his efforts, the case was never reopened.

The criminal law expert [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] puts Sutermeister's ''Summa iniuria'' in the context of the earlier works of [[Erich Sello]], [[Max Alsberg]], [[Albert Hellwig]], [[Max Hirschberg]] and [[Heinrich Jagusch]] and considers him as a "committed fighters for a constitutionally protected Criminal Justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]].

== Bibliography ==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=totally exagerrated list of published items|date=December 2016}} 
The '''bibliography of Hans Martin Sutermeister''' includes a fictional novel and around 150 scientific articles, essays and books, some of them [[Investigative journalism]] written by the Swiss writer Hans Martin Sutermeister, pen name Hans Moehrlen (1907–1977). Sutermeister was a prolific writer on topics related to [[psychosomatic medicine]], [[music psychology]] and [[history of medicine]] as well as contemporary Swiss society and cultural criticism, whom [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] in 2008 declared "a fierce fighter for justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Peters | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Peters (jurist) | title = Justiz als Schicksal: ein Plädoyer für die andere Seite | publisher = [[De Gruyter]] | year = 1979 | location = Berlin | pages = 192 | language = German | isbn =978-2-01-005712-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutermeister is best remembered for his contradictory political as a both-left-and-rightwing libertarian-authoritarian presence in local media. Every line of work that he has written since 1942 seeming, directly or indirectly, in favour of a [[monism|monist]] [[Weltanschauung|worldview]]. To that end, Sutermeister used his scientific writing to defend his political convictions, as shown in several book reviews. He first achieved acclaim with his non–fictional books from ''Psychologie und Weltanschauung'' (1944) to ''Schiller als Arzt'' (1955) and cemented his place in local history as one of the greatest Swiss pamphletists with the publication of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'' shortly before his death.

Sutermeister wrote non-fiction—including book reviews, editorials, and investigative journalism—for a variety of Swiss periodicals, mainly [[Public health journal|medical journals]]. He particularly wrote a book-length investigation of [[comprehensive school]]s in Switzerland and another of [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in the form of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'', a retrospective of criminal justice mainly in Switzerland and Germany.

No attempts have been made until now to comprehensively collect the entirety of his miscellany.

=== Books ===
Sutermeister composed one novel, ''Zwischen zwei Welten'', which is autobiographical; it was inspired by his period working as a student during [[Second World War|wartime]]; it records his experiences living and [[wikt:tramping|tramping]] in a town where he later finished his medical studies; the names are partially fictionalized:

=== Articles ===
Sutermeister wrote dozens of essays and book reviews. His insights into [[history of medicine]], literature, and politics (defending in particular [[anti-fascist]], [[liberal socialist]], [[freethought]] and somehow [[anti-communist]] ideas) during the following years. Since his death, many essays have disappeared, with the first attempt at a comprehensive collection being this list. Some of his essays, mainly during his time as member of the [[Ring of Independents]] political party, took the form of [[pamphlet]]s and were published and distributed (by himself) independently.

The following list contains the articles which are both registered in [[PubMed]] and can be considered as outstanding because of their scope, theme range or length:

'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that [[system]]s (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term holism was coined by [[Jan_Smuts|Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="HaE"&gt;{{ cite book | first = Jan Christiaan | last = Smuts | title = Holism and Evolution 2nd Edition |publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first publication of ''Holism and Evolution'' was by Macmillan and Co. in 1926. Smuts published a 2nd edition in 1927 and there have been at least three subsequent reprints; Compass/Viking Press 1961, Greenwood Press 1973, and Sierra Sunrise Books 1999 (a version edited by Sanford Holst). The full text of the 1927 2nd edition is available on the Internet Archive site, and this is the source used in updating the Holism page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] considered holism as a concept that represents all of the wholes in the universe, and these wholes are the real factors in the universe. Further, that Holism also denoted a theory of the universe in the same vein as Materialism and Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

== Synopsis of ''Holism and Evolution'' ==
After identifying the need for reform in the fundamental concepts of matter, life and mind (chapter 1) Smuts examines the reformed concepts (as of 1926) of space and time (chapter 2), matter (chapter 3) and biology (chapter 4) and concludes that the close approach to each other of the concepts of matter, life and mind, and the partial overflow of each other's domain, imply that there is a fundamental principle (Holism) of which they are the progressive outcome.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|86}}  Chapters 5 and 6 provide the general concept, functions and categories of Holism; chapters 7 and 8 address Holism with respect to Mechanism and Darwinism, chapters 9-11 make a start towards demonstrating the concepts and functions of Holism for the metaphysical categories (mind, personality, ideals) and the book concludes with a chapter that argues for the universal ubiquity of Holism and its place as a monistic ontology.

The following is an overview of Smuts' opinions regarding the general concept, functions, and categories of Holism; like the definition of Holism, other than the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the editor is unaware of any authoritative secondary sources corroborating Smuts' opinions.

=== Structure ===
Wholes are composites which have an internal structure, function or character which clearly differentiate them from mechanical additions, aggregates, and constructions, such as science assumes on the mechanical hypothesis.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|106}} The concept of structure is not confined to the physical domain (e.g. chemical, biological and artifacts);  it also applies to the metaphysical domain (e.g. mental structures, properties, attributes, values, ideals, etc.)&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Field ===
The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|113}}  The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its past—and also its future potentialities.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|89}}  As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Variation ===

Darwin's theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection, but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections; it is holistic.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|190–192}}

=== Regulation ===

The whole exhibits a discernible regulatory function as it relates to cooperation and coordination of the structure and activity of parts, and to the selection and deselection of variations. The result is a balanced correlation of organs and functions. The activities of the parts are directed to central ends; co-operation and unified action instead of the separate mechanical activities of the parts.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Creativity ===
It is the intermingling of fields which is creative or causal in nature.  This is seen in matter, where if not for its dynamic structural creative character matter could not have been the mother of the universe.  This function, or factor of creativity is even more marked in biology where the protoplasm of the cell is vitally active in an ongoing process of creative change where parts are continually being destroyed and replaced by new protoplasm. With minds the regulatory function of Holism acquires consciousness and freedom, demonstrating a creative power of the most far-reaching character. Holism is not only creative but self-creative, and its final structures are far more holistic than its initial structures.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|18, 37, 67–68, 88–89 }}

=== Causality ===
As it relates to causality Smuts makes reference to [[A. N. Whitehead]], and indirectly [[Baruch Spinoza]]; the Whitehead premise is that organic mechanism is a fundamental process which realizes and actualizes individual syntheses or unities.  Holism (the factor) exemplifies this same idea while emphasizing the holistic character of the process.  The whole completely transforms the concept of Causality; results are not directly a function of causes. The whole absorbs and integrates the cause into its own activity; results appear as the consequence of the activity of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|121–124,126}}  Note that this material relating to Whitehead's influence as it relates to causality was added in the second edition, and of course will not be found in reprints of the first edition; nor is it included in the most recent Holst edition.  It is the second edition of ''Holism and Evolution'' (1927) that provides the most recent and definitive treatment by Smuts.

=== The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental holistic characters as a unity of parts which is so close and intense as to be more than the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to the parts, but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered;  the synthesis affects and determines the parts, so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and the parts, therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in the parts and the parts are in the whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of the parts as well as of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Progressive grading of wholes ===
A "rough and provisional" summary of the progressive grading of wholes that comprise holism is as follows:&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

# Material structure e.g. a chemical compound
# Functional structure in living bodies 
# Animals, which exhibit a degree of central control that is primarily implicit and unconscious
# Personality, characterized as conscious central control
# States and similar group organizations characterized by central control that involve many people 
# Holistic Ideals, or absolute Values, distinct from human personality that are creative factors in the creation of a spiritual world, for example Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

==Holism in philosophy==
{{main|Confirmation holism|Semantic holism}}
In philosophy, any doctrine that emphasizes the priority of a whole over its parts is holism. Some suggest that such a definition owes its origins to a non-holistic view of language and places it in the reductivist camp. Alternately, a 'holistic' definition of holism denies the necessity of a division between the function of separate parts and the workings of the 'whole'. Effectively this means that the concept of a part has no absolute foundation in observation, but is rather a result of a materialist structuring of reality based on the necessity of logical and distinct units as a means to deriving information through comparative analysis. It suggests that the key recognizable characteristic of a concept of 'true' holism is a sense of the fundamental truth of any particular experience. This exists in contradistinction to what is perceived as the reductivist reliance on inductive method as the key to verification of its concept of how the parts function within the whole. Equally the potential for recognising the clarity of holistic experience within the logical terms of maths is limited by the abstract nature of numbers. In terms of real life measurements numbers have no scale or dimensional properties, so they have to rely on experimentally verified units (e.g. inches, volts, calories etc.), to describe reality. It is this reliance on the holistic integrity of experience which leads to the recognition that intuitive perception rather than mathematical calculation is the source of the truth of effective theories.  (See references Holism, 2016.)

=== Philosophy of language ===
In the [[philosophy of language]] this becomes the claim, called [[semantic holism]], that the meaning of an individual word or sentence can only be understood in terms of its relations to a larger body of language, even a whole theory or a whole language. In the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state may be identified only in terms of its relations with others. This is often referred to as "content holism" or "holism of the mental". This notion involves the philosophies of such figures as [[Frege]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_holism.html ''Holism'', The Basics of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and confirmation holism ===
[[epistemological holism|Epistemological]] and [[confirmation holism]] are mainstream ideas in contemporary philosophy.

=== Ontological holism ===
Ontological holism was espoused by [[David Bohm]] in his theory&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1980). ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7100-0971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[implicate and explicate order]].

=== Spinoza ===
The concept of holism played a pivotal role in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Huenemann, ''Interpreting Spinoza: Critical Essays'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccy De Jonge, ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'', UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
Hegel rejected "the fundamentally atomistic conception of the object," (Stern, 38) arguing that "individual objects exist as manifestations of indivisible substance-universals, which cannot be reduced to a set of properties or attributes; he therefore holds that the object should be treated as an ontologically primary whole." (Stern, 40) In direct opposition to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], therefore, "Hegel insists that the unity we find in our experience of the world is not constructed by us out of a plurality of intuitions." (Stern, 40) In "his ontological scheme a concrete individual is not reducible to a plurality of sensible properties, but rather exemplifies a substance universal." (Stern, 41) His point is that it is "a mistake to treat an organic substance like blood as nothing more than a compound of unchanging chemical elements, that can be separated and united without being fundamentally altered." (Stern, 103) In Hegel's view, a substance like blood is thus "more of an organic unity and cannot be understood as just an external composition of the sort of distinct substances that were discussed at the level of chemistry." (Stern, 103) Thus in Hegel's view, blood is blood and cannot be successfully reduced to what we consider are its component parts; we must view it as a whole substance entire unto itself. This is most certainly a fundamentally holistic view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge Chapman Hall, 1990 (full text download)] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520122904/http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf |date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [Editors note: work in progress, moving references to Hegel to a common section] [[Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;6 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merold Westphal, ''Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity'', New York: SUNY, 1992, pp.79-81, &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Esfield, ''Holism in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Physics'', Springer, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Maria Tito, ''Logic in the Husserlian Context'', Northwestern University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Holism in physical sciences==
{{main |Holism in science}}

=== Agriculture ===
There are several newer methods in [[agricultural science]] such as [[permaculture]] and holistic planned grazing ([[holistic management]]) that integrate [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

=== Chaos and complexity ===
In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.{{Sfn | von Bertalanffy | 1971 | p = 54}}

Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

[[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] (also called "science of complexity") is a contemporary heir of systems thinking. It comprises both computational and holistic, relational approaches towards understanding [[complex adaptive systems]], and especially in the latter, some argue that it can be seen as the polar opposite to reductive methods. General theories of complexity have been proposed, and numerous complexity institutes and departments have sprung up around the world. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] is arguably the most famous of them.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Earth seen from [[Apollo 17]]]]
{{See also|Holistic community}}
Holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

[[John Muir]], Scots-born early American conservationist,&lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting with John Muir By Terry Gifford, University of Georgia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".

More information is to be found in the field of [[systems ecology]], a cross-disciplinary field influenced by [[general systems theory]].

=== Medicine ===
In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"&gt;Lipowski, 1977.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A disturbance on any level—somatic, psychic, or social—will radiate to all the other levels, too. In this sense, psychosomatic thinking is similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]] of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many [[alternative medicine]] practitioners claim a [[Holistic health|holistic approach to healing]].

=== Neurology ===
A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holism in social sciences==

=== Architecture ===
Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.

=== Branding ===
A holistic brand (also holistic branding) is considering the entire brand or image of the company. For example, a universal brand image across all countries, including everything from advertising styles to the stationery the company has made, to the company colours.

=== Economics ===
With roots in [[Schumpeter]], the evolutionary approach might be considered the holistic theory in economics. It shares certain language from the biological evolutionary approach. It takes into account how the [[innovation system]] evolves over time. Knowledge and know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why are part of the whole business economics. Knowledge can also be tacit, as described by [[Michael Polanyi]]. These models are open, and consider that it is hard to predict exactly the impact of a policy measure. They are also less mathematical.

=== Education reform ===
The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made." [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

===Psychology===

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holistic movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his ''Phenomenology of Perception''.

==== Teleological psychology ====
[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

=== Anthropology ===
There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shore | first = Bradd | year = 1999 | title = Strange Fate of Holism | journal = Anthropology News | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 4–5 | doi = 10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last =Segal | editor1-first = Daniel A | first2 = Ian | editor2-last = Yanagisako | first1 = James | last1 = Clifford | last2 = Hodder | first3 = Rena | last3 = Lederman | first4 = Michael | last4 = Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year= 2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm anthrobase definition of holism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Émile Durkheim ====
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}} {{see also|Ubuntu (philosophy)}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] developed a concept of holism which he set as opposite to the notion that a [[society]] was nothing more than a simple collection of individuals. In more recent times, [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; has contrasted "holism" to "[[individualism]]" as two different forms of societies. According to him, modern humans live in an individualist society, whereas ancient Greek society, for example, could be qualified as "holistic", because the individual found identity in the whole society. Thus, the individual was ready to sacrifice himself or herself for his or her [[community]], as his or her life without the ''[[polis]]'' had no sense whatsoever.

==== Cosmomorphism ====
The French Protestant missionary [[Maurice Leenhardt]] coined the term "cosmomorphism" to indicate the state of perfect [[symbiosis]] with the surrounding environment which characterized the culture of the [[Melanesians]] of [[New Caledonia]]. For these people, an isolated individual is totally indeterminate, indistinct, and featureless until he can find his position within the natural and social world in which he is inserted. The confines between the self and the world are annulled to the point that the material body itself is no guarantee of the sort of recognition of identity which is typical of our own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bihan, [http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/bihan_writer.html "The Writer, a Man Without Qualities"], ''Literature and Identity in New Caledonia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen, [http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/journal/3_1/pdf/IJDS.3.1.03.Rasmussen.pdf "Personahood, Self, Difference, and Dialogue (Commentary on Chaudhary)"], ''International Journal for Dialogical Science'', Fall 2008, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Holistic concepts are strongly represented within the thoughts expressed within [[Logos]] (per [[Heraclitus]]), [[Panentheism]] and [[Pantheism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[theological anthropology]], which belongs to theology and not to anthropology, holism is the belief that [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] are not separate components of a person, but rather facets of a united whole.&lt;ref&gt;"The traditional anthropology encounters major problems in the Bible and its predominantly holistic view of human beings. Genesis 2:7 is a key verse: 'Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being' (NRSV). The 'living being' (traditionally, 'living soul') is an attempt to translate the Hebrew ''nephesh hayah'', which indicates a 'living person' in the context. More than one interpreter has pointed out that this text does not say that the human being ''has'' a soul but rather ''is'' a soul. H. Wheeler Robinson summarized the matter in his statement that 'The Hebrew conceived man as animated body and not as an incarnate soul.'" (Martin E. Tate, "The Comprehensive Nature of Salvation in Biblical Perspective," ''Evangelical review of theology'', Vol. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological field project consultancies ==
The Institute is involved in a series of ecological demonstration projects, selected in challenging biomes facing ecological degradation and cultural conflict. These were chosen because conventional approaches do not work, requiring innovative, "ecotechic" approaches with the goals of ecological upgrade, economic sustainability and to develop the capabilities of I.E. members and associates. The projects, and the Heraclitus, are places where hands-on educational programsand volunteer opportunities are provided.

Synergia Ranch, started in 1969, was the Institute's first ecological field project. There on 130 acres of desertifying high altitude sem-arid juniper/pinon grasslands, I.E. developed a program to restore the land, with the goal of creating an oasis in the desert. Over a thousand trees were planted, including 450 fruit trees, organic vegetable gardens and an extensive soil-building program using compost to restore lost fertility to an area which had been overgrazed and cleared for inappropriate broad-acre farming in the 1920s. Adobe buildings and a geodesic dome were built and artisan enterprises started including pottery, woodworking, iron working, clothing, leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wastewater Gardener: Preserving the Planet One Flush at a Time|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=Synergetic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0907791515|location=Santa Fe, NM|pages=Chapter 2, Flower Power at Synergia Ranch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A construction firm build some three dozen adobe buildings in Santa Fe, contributing to a renaissance of traditional adobe architecture. The orchards and vegetable gardens are certified organic and in 2016 Synergia Ranch won the Good Earth award at the New Mexico Organic Agriculture conference in recognition of its land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://farmersmarketinstitute.org/news-and-events/synergia-ranch-good-earth-award/|title=Synergia Ranch Good Earth Award|last=Alexis|first=|date=February 23, 2017|website=Santa Fe Farmers Market Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecotechnic life style approach was to balance by engaging in three lines of work: ecology, enterprise and theater. The Theater of All Possibilities was based at Synergia Ranch for over a decade.

Les Marronniers near Aix-en-Provence, France, begun in 1976 is the ecotechnic field project in the Mediterranean biome. It has also served as a frequent location for the international conferences which I.E. organizes bringing together scientists, artists, engineers, managers and thinkers to engage on topics of broad interest. Les Marronniers has also revivified on 7 ha (17 acres) the mixed agriculture small holdings traditional in the area, with orchard, grapes, field crops, woodlot, domestic animals and art/sculpture workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecotechnics.edu/2011/02/les-marronniers-southern-france/|title=Les Marronniers Southern France|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute of Ecotechnics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwood Downs, a 4300 acre property in the Kimberley region of NW Western Australia, is the Institute's tropical savannah biomic project. Established in 1978, its goals are to regenerate an overgrazed ecology dominated by invasive scrub trees with drought-resistant grasses and legumes and to demostrate ecotechnic ways of living within a sometimes harsh climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Conceptual Model for Synergetic Management of the Savannahs, in Tothill, J.C. and Mott, J, eds.

Recognizing that cities, part of the anthropogenic urban biome, are crucial players in the biosphere, I.E. helped establish the [[October Gallery]] in London in 1979 as its world city project. The October Gallery's goal is to find and showcase cutting-edge artists of the "transvangarde" from around the world. It also supports a robust educational program bringing many London school children into the gallery to meet artists and make art, as well as traveling exhibitions. Designed as a place where science and art can interact, it also hosts scientific, cultural and musical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/|title=October Gallery: Contemporary Art from Around the Planet|last=|first=|date=|website=October Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Las Casas de la Selva project in Patillas, Puerto Rico became I.E. tropical rainforest project. On almost 1000 acres of mountainous secondary forest, the goal of the project is to show innovative methods of forest enrichment and to promote sustainable tropical forestry. With the cooperation of Puerto Rican departments of development and forestry, some 40,000 seedlings of valuable timber species were planted on one-third of the land. Line-planting was employed to minimize the impact on the surrounding forest and to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=The Impact of Hardwood Line-Planting on Tree and Amphibian Biodiversity in a Secondary Wet Tropical Forest,  Southeast Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Journal of Sustainable Forestry|volume=(2010) 29(5)|pages=503–516|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=Enriched secondary subtropical forest through line-planting for sustainable timber production in Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Bois et Forêts des Tropiques|volume=(November 2011) 309(3)|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas won the 2016 Energy Globe national award for Puerto Rico and is recovering from severe damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

The concept gives guidelines on how scientific objectives and not membership in either a privileged or vulnerable population should determine which members of which communities should meet inclusion criteria to participate in research in order to most equitably share the risks and benefits of the research.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

{{Unreferenced|date=January 2010}}

A '''location''' ('''spatial''') '''model''' refers to any [[monopolistic]] competition model in [[economics]] that demonstrates consumer preference for particular brands of goods and their locations. Examples of location models include [[Harold Hotelling|Hotelling]]’s Location Model, Salop’s Circle Model, and hybrid variations.

==Traditional vs. location models==

In traditional economic models, consumers display preference given the constraints of a [[Product (business)|product]] characteristic space. Consumers perceive certain brands with common characteristics to be [[substitute good|close substitutes]], and differentiate these products from their unique characteristics. For example, there are many brands of chocolate with nuts and others without them. Hence, the chocolate with nuts is a constraint of its product characteristic space.

On the other hand, consumers in location models display preference for both the [[utility]] gained from a particular brand’s characteristics as well as its geographic location; these two factors form an enhanced “product characteristic space”. Consumers are now willing to sacrifice pleasure from products for a closer geographic location, and vice versa. For example, consumers realize high costs for products that are located far from their spatial point (e.g. transportation costs, time, etc.) and also for products that deviate from their ideal features. Firms have greater [[market power]] when they satisfy the consumer’s [[demand]] for products at closer distance or preferred products.

==Hotelling's Location Model==

In 1929, [[Harold Hotelling|Hotelling]] developed a location model that demonstrates the relationship between location and pricing behavior of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Harold |last=Hotelling |title=Stability in Competition |journal=Economic Journal |volume=39 |issue=153 |year=1929 |pages=41–57 |doi=10.2307/2224214}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented this notion through a line of fixed length. Assuming all consumers are identical (except for location) and consumers are evenly dispersed along the line, both the firms and consumer respond to changes in demand and the economic environment.

In Hotelling’s Location Model, firms do not exercise variations in product characteristics; firms compete and price their products in only one dimension, geographic location. Therefore, traditional usage of this model should be used for consumers who perceive products to be perfect substitutes or as a foundation for modern location models.

===An example of fixed firms===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the line in [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling’s location model]] is actually a street with fixed length.

All consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located at two equal quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt;, which is divided in the center by point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Consumers face a transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;; they have no preferences for the firms.

There are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is fixed in location and sells an identical product.

====Advanced Analysis====

Given the assumptions of the Hotelling model, consumers will choose either firm as long as the combined price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt; and transportation cost &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt; of the product is less than the competitive firm.

For example, if both firms sell the product at the same price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt;, consumers in quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt; will pick the firm closest to them. The price realized by the consumer is

&lt;math&gt; P+c=P1 \, &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; P1 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the price of the product including the cost of transportation.

As long as &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt; for Firm x is greater than Firm y, consumers will travel to Firm y to purchase their product; this minimizes &lt;math&gt; P1 \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Only the consumers who live at point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;, the halfway point between the two firms, will be indifferent between the two product locations.

===An example of firm relocation===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the line in Hotelling’s location model is actually a street with fixed length.

All consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located in four quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt;; the halfway point between the endpoints is point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Consumers face an equal transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;; they have no preferences for the firms.

There are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is able to relocate at no cost, and sells an identical product.

====Analysis====

In this example, Firm x and Firm y will maximize their profit by increasing their consumer pool. Firm x will move slightly toward Firm y, in order to gain Firm y’s customers. In response, Firm y will move slightly toward Firm x to re-establish its loss, and increase the pool from its competitor. The cycle repeats until both firms are at point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;, the halfway point of the street where each firm has the same number of customers. This result is known as [[Hotelling's law]].

If only Firm x can relocate without costs and Firm y is fixed, Firm x will move to the side of Firm y where the consumer pool is maximized. Consequently, the profits gained from Firm X significantly increase, while Firm Y incurs a significant loss.

==Salop’s Circle Model==
One of the most famous variations of Hotelling’s location model is Salop’s circle model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven C. |last=Salop | title = Monopolistic competition with outside goods | year = 1979 | journal = The Bell Journal of Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–156 | jstor = 3003323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the previous spatial representations, the circle model examines consumer preference with regards to geographic location. However, Salop introduces two significant factors: 1) firms are located around a [[circle]] with no end-points, and 2) it allows the consumer to choose a second, heterogeneous good.

===An example of a second good===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the consumers are equidistant from one another around the circle. The model will occur for one time period, in which only one product is purchased. The consumer will have a choice of purchasing variations of Product A (a differentiated product) or Product B (an outside good; undifferentiated product).

There are two firms also located equidistant around the circle. Each firm offers a variation of Product A, and an outside firm offers a good, Product B.

====Analysis====

In this example, the consumer wants to purchase their ideal variation of Product A. They are willing to purchase the product, given that it is within the constraint of their utility, transportation/distance costs, and price.

The utility &lt;math&gt; u \, &lt;/math&gt; for a particular product at distance &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; is represented in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) = u - r|d-d_1| \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; u \, &lt;/math&gt; is the utility from a superior brand, &lt;math&gt; r \, &lt;/math&gt; denotes the rate at which an inferior brand lowers the utility from the superior brand, &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; is the location of the superior brand, and &lt;math&gt; d_1 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the location of the consumer. The distance between the brand and the consumer is thereby given in &lt;math&gt;|d-d_1| \, &lt;/math&gt;.

The consumer’s primary goal is to maximize consumer surplus, i.e. purchase the product that best satisfies any combination of price and quality. Although the consumer may receive more pleasure from their superior brand, the inferior brand may maximize the surplus &lt;math&gt; CS \, &lt;/math&gt; which is given by:

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) - P = CS \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the difference is  between the utility of a product at location &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; and the price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Now suppose the consumer also has the option to purchase an outside, undifferentiated Product B. The consumer surplus gained from Product B is denoted by &lt;math&gt; u^* \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, for a given amount of money, the consumer will purchase the superior variation of Product A over Product B as long as

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) - P \ge u^* \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the consumer surplus from the superior variation of Product A is greater than the consumer surplus gained from Product B.

Alternatively, the consumer only purchases the superior variation of product A as long as

&lt;math&gt; u - u^* - r|d-d_1| - P \ge 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the difference between the surplus of the superior variation of Product A and the surplus gained from Product B is positive.

'''Logical consequence''' (also '''entailment''') is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]], which describes the relationship between [[statement (logic)|statement]]s that hold true when one statement logically ''follows from'' one or more statements. A [[Validity (logic)|valid]] logical [[argument]] is one in which the [[Consequent|conclusion]] is entailed by the [[premise]]s, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The [[philosophical analysis]] of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?&lt;ref name="sep" &gt;Beall, JC and Restall, Greg, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/logical-consequence/ Logical Consequence]'' The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  All of [[philosophical logic]] is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of [[logical truth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine, Willard Van Orman]], ''Philosophy of Logic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical consequence is [[logical truth|necessary]] and [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formal]], by way of examples that explain with [[formal proof]] and [[interpretation (logic)|models of interpretation]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given [[Formal language|language]], [[if and only if]], using only logic (i.e. without regard to any ''personal'' interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[[Matthew W. McKeon|McKeon, Matthew]], ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/logcon/ Logical Consequence]'' Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given [[formal language|language]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, either by constructing a [[deductive system]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; or by formal [[Intended interpretation|intended semantics]] for language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.  The Polish logician [[Alfred Tarski]] identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the [[logical form]] of the sentences, (2) The relation is [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], i.e. it can be determined with or without regard to [[empirical evidence]] (sense experience), and (3) The logical consequence relation has a [[modal logic|modal]] component.&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt;

== Formal accounts ==
The most widely prevailing view on how to best account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality. This is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or [[logical form]] of the statements without regard to the contents of that form.

Syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on [[schema (logic)|schemes]] using [[inference rule]]s. For instance, we can express the logical form of a valid argument as:

: All ''X'' are ''Y''
: All ''Y'' are ''Z''
: Therefore, all ''X'' are ''Z''.

This argument is formally valid, because every [[Substitution (logic)|instance]] of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid.

This is in contrast to an argument like "Fred is Mike's brother's son. Therefore Fred is Mike's nephew." Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words "brother", "son", and "nephew", the statement "Fred is Mike's nephew" is a so-called [[material conditional|material consequence]] of "Fred is Mike's brother's son," not a formal consequence. A formal consequence must be true ''in all cases'', however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence, since even the argument "''P'' is ''Q'''s brother's son, therefore ''P'' is ''Q'''s nephew" is valid in all cases, but is not a ''formal'' argument.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== A priori property of logical consequence ==

If you know that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; follows logically from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; no information about the possible interpretations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; will affect that knowledge. Our knowledge that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a logical consequence of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; cannot be influenced by [[A priori and a posteriori|empirical knowledge]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; Deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience, so they must be knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; However, formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge. So the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== Proofs and models ==
The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of ''proofs'' and via ''models''. The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called (its) [[proof theory]] whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is called (its) [[model theory]].&lt;ref name="ChiaraDoets1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara |editor2=Kees Doets |editor3=Daniele Mundici |editor4=Johan van Benthem |title=Logic and Scientific Methods: Volume One of the Tenth International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, Florence, August 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCthvF8xLIAC&amp;pg=PA292|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4383-7|page=292|chapter=Logical consequence: a turn in style|author=Kosta Dosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

if and only if there is no model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; in which all members of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is false.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Etchemendy|Etchemendy, John]], ''Logical consequence'',  The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, in other words, the set of the interpretations that make all members of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; true is a subset of the set of the interpretations that make &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; true.

== Modal accounts ==

[[Modal logic|Modal]] accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if it is ''necessary'' that if all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true.

Alternatively (and, most would say, equivalently):

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if it is ''impossible'' for all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to be true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; false.

Such accounts are called "modal" because they appeal to the modal notions of [[Logical truth|logical necessity]]  and  [[logical possibility]]. 'It is necessary that' is often expressed as a [[universal quantification|universal quantifier]] over [[possible world]]s, so that the accounts above translate as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if there is no possible world at which all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is false (untrue).

Consider the modal account in terms of the argument given as an example above:

:All frogs are green.
:Kermit is a frog.
:Therefore, Kermit is green.

The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can't imagine a possible world where (a) all frogs are green; (b) Kermit is a frog; and (c) Kermit is not green.

=== Modal-formal accounts ===

Modal-formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and formal accounts above, yielding variations on the following basic idea:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is impossible for an argument with the same logical form as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to have true premises and a false conclusion.

=== Warrant-based accounts ===

The accounts considered above are all "truth-preservational," in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion. As an alternative, some have proposed "[[Theory of justification|warrant]]-preservational" accounts, according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible. This is (roughly) the account favored by [[intuitionist]]s such as [[Michael Dummett]].

=== Non-monotonic logical consequence ===
{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}

The accounts discussed above all yield [[Monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] consequence relations, i.e. ones such that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of any superset of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. It is also possible to specify non-monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that, e.g., 'Tweety can fly' is a logical consequence of

:{Birds can typically fly, Tweety is a bird}

but not of

:{Birds can typically fly, Tweety is a bird, Tweety is a penguin}.

Commonly called '''new media theory''' or '''media-centered theory''' of [[Composition studies|composition]], media theory focuses on how writing is created, keeping in mind particularly the tools and mediums used in the composition process. New media refers to a range of digital modes of communication, often incorporating a multi-modal mix of the visual or oral in addition to traditional text. Stemming from the rise of [[computers]] as [[word processing]] tools, media theorists now also examine the rhetorical strengths and weakness of different media, and the implications these have for [[literacy]], [[author]], and reader.

==New media defined==
The meaning of the term 'new media' can be confusing and debated over. At times extended to mean any sort of media that is not purely written-text-based, it generally refers to any medium that is technologically 'advanced' from pure text. The broadness of the term is useful in that it allows for the multiple modes that can be encompassed by this definition, instead of being focused on the technical aspect that the term 'digital' would invite. With this in mind, though, terms like 'digital', 'hyper-textual', 'interactive', 'simulated', 'virtual', and 'networked' can often be helpful when thinking about what constitutes new media.&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often a false dichotomy drawn between the 'analogue' media and the 'new' media; media theory invites re-mediation of texts, which often result in a mix of mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther Kress remarks on the new responsibilities of writers:
"In the new theory of representation, in the present technological context of electronic, multimodal, multimedia textual production, the task of text-makers is that of complex orchestration. Further, individuals are now seen as remakers, transformers, of sets of representational resources... ."&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical construct==
Noted scholar in the field, Cynthia Selfe has frequently commented on the exigency of incorporating new media in the writing classroom, noting its ability to make students rhetorically aware of the arguments that they commonly take for granted based on medium. She states,
"Composition teachers, language arts teachers, and other literacy specialists need to recognize that the relevance of technology in the English studies disciplines is not simply a matter of helping students work effectively with communication software and hardware, but, rather, also a matter of helping them to understand and to be able to assess – to pay attention to – the social, economic, and pedagogical implications of new communication technologies and technological initiatives that affect their lives." &lt;ref&gt;Selfe, Cynthia L. (1999) "Technology and literacy: A story about the perils of not paying attention" College Composition and Communication, 50(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ohmann extends this argument, saying, "Adults ignorant of computers will soon be as restricted as those who today are unable to read. Software will become the language of the future, and the dominant intellectual asset of the human race, so that an understanding of software will be a primary component of literacy in the electronic age".&lt;ref&gt;Ohmann, Richard. "Literacy, Technology, and Monopoly Capital" Cross Talk In Comp Theory: A Reader. Ed. Victor Villanueva &amp; Kristin L. Arola. Urbana: NCTE, 2011. 699–716. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Holding intersections with rhetorical theory, new media theory focuses on how different mediums work rhetorically within various contexts. It subscribes to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s coined phrase "[[the medium is the message]]", or rather, that a message's content is just as important as the medium that delivers it in affecting how the message is received. A large amount of new media theory's focus is also on how different mediums generate different thinking; the theory proposes that new mediums produce specific (often unique) rhetorical moves like multi-threaded thought processes through the use of interactive texts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Stephen. "[[Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter]]." New York City: Riverhead Trade, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this, patterns of organization and production are topics of emphasis for new media theory, especially when thinking about the commonly non-sequential or thinking and writing of new media, particularly through the use of [[hyperlinks]]. Gunther Kress says about the complexity of new media composition, "But this one person now has to understand the semiotic potentials of each mode–sound, visual, speech–and orchestrate them to accord with his or her design. Multimedia production requires high levels of competence based on knowledge of the operation of different modes, and highly developed design abilities to produce complex semiotic "texts."&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Media theory focuses on the effects that can come from utilizing new media, like new textual experiences and new ways of representing the world. One effect is the changing relationship between subjects and technologies, especially in relation to [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The earliest research that can be considered part of media theory involved the use of computers as word processors. However, with the advent of applications like [[HyperCard]] for the Apple Macintosh, the focus in media research shifted to hypertext's implications in the writing classroom.
 
Much research has been done regarding technological literacy, and questions of literacy in general. Richard Ohmann,&lt;ref&gt;Ohmann, R. (2008). Literacy, technology, and monopoly capital. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 20–34). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1985, questions the focus on technological literacy appearing in schools at the time. Insisting that technological literacy is tied to socioeconomic class, Ohmann, and others like him began to research the possibility for educational ostracism because of a lack of access to technological tools. This contrasts starkly with much of the utopian visions of the technological classroom that others exhibited.
 
Current research is being conducted multimodal composition, broadening composition to encompass video, video games, music, and other interactive media [[Digital Media]].

==Authorship==
Identity and the construction of such is an area of particular focus for new media theory.&lt;ref&gt;Penrod, Dianne. "Composition in convergence: the impact of new media on writing assessment." Boca Raton: Taylor and Francis Publishing, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can control how they are represented online through personalized [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] and profiles, and the rhetorical moves behind this are often explored. Identity is an important aspect of authorship in many new media writings in this manner, then, especially in situations like [[Internet forums]].
 
Many instances of new media have difficulty controlling authorship, though, and new media theory does not always view this as a bad thing. Digital medias are in a constant state of flux (versus the relative fixity of traditional text) because several transformations may occur. For instance, in the case of [[email]], messages may be replied to or forwarded several times, during which times previous messages may be revised or edited by various parties.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Jeff. "The rhetoric of cool: composition studies and new media". Carbondale: Southern Illinois University, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies that allow for simultaneous authoring of texts also produce this effect.
 
Authorship is further complicated by the refashioning of analogue texts or the "[[remixing]]" of several new media texts. Jay Bolter says,
"In the new theory of representation, in the present technological context of electronic, multimodal, multimedia textual production, the task of text-makers is that of complex orchestration. Further, individuals are now seen as remakers, transformers, of sets of representational resources."&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Those involved in new media theories have often needed to redefine "author" in the context of new media. Some theorists draw a difference between the authors of analogue texts as people who produce texts that readers interpret; in contrast, those who produce new media texts are seen as being in better alignment with the term "experience designers", because they create spaces within which readers make their own paths.&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly true for interactive and immersive texts. This produces even more debate over who is seen as an author, because in many new media texts, the reader plays a dual role of consumer and producer.

==Teaching methods and pedagogical basis==
Media theory focuses on the [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] that composing in new media can give writers. It is important not to simply add in new media as a problematic addendum to analogue writing; instead,&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers can take advantage of these "new" means by calling students to become both consumers or critics of new media as well as producers, as technology's role in society becomes ever more prominent. Giving students the resources to take part in discourses around and through new media gives them the power and agency to act in this digital world.
 
The agency gained through new media composition also provides a basis for [[social change]]. Gunther Kress remarks on the potential for teaching design via new media composition in the classroom:
Design takes for granted competence in the use of resources, but beyond that it requires the orchestration and remaking of these resources in the services of frameworks and models that express the maker's intentions in shaping the social and cultural environment. While critique looks at the present through the means of past production, design shapes the future through deliberate deployment of representational resources in the designer's interest.&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teachers cite the ease of which students pick up on the techniques of composition and analysis of new media. The visually saturated and technologically heavy society of today means that students and writers will need to question the communications and compositions around them as rhetorical moves integral to the culture students live in.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their familiarity with and knowledge of new media often results in positive, conscious appropriation of media, and opens the door for discussions of repurposing within culture. Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin say:
No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation from other social and economic forces. What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media and the ways in which older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One potentially useful method of teaching composition with media theory in mind is through the use of online classrooms. [[Massive Open Online Course]]s (MOOCs) and [[Online Writing Lab]]s (OWLs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially with [[distance learning]]. These educational formats also typically deal with analogue texts, but provide technologically based resources for this composition process via digital feedback and revision techniques.
 
Media theory has particular potential for teaching basic writers or students whose native language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Arnie. "Teaching Media Literacy in the ESL Classroom." Language Magazine. April 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a "literacy" that "translates" better across languages and demographics, new media can serve to engage students who were previously uninterested in composition, as well as allow these students to feel like they have more expertise or agency in the composing process. Furthermore, it allows for more creativity and exploration of rhetorical power in composition as students learn the semiotic power of various modes of discourse through technology.

==Intersections with other composition theories==
Because media theory focuses so much on specific, often technical aspects of writing, it has much room for overlap, and facilitates other theoretical composition pedagogies.

For instance, [[Writing Across the Curriculum]] (commonly known as WAC) focuses on the different ideologies, paradigms, and standards between various disciplines, especially when it comes to writing and how these play out within writing. Thus, WAC recommends an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes these differences and the rhetorical awareness that is needed to write to varying audiences. Media theory works well with WAC because it, too, emphasizes different and multiple literacies. Not only does it emphasize a multi-modal approach to writing, but it also emphasizes the fact that the writer will have to be aware of different audience's familiarity with technology. Furthermore, WAC can easily be combined with media theory because technology and digital writing are becoming more popular in all disciplines, so understanding the differences that come with various fields could potentially interact with the implications of using digital composition instead of traditional print.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Doug. "New Media, New Modes, and New Options for Writing Across the Curriculum." NC State. N.d. Presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory that media theory is conducive to in composition is [[collaborative learning]] theory. Typically, this theory focuses on the construction of knowledge as a social act.  Media theory aligns well with collaborative learning because, with the advancement of technology, writing can easily accommodate multiple authors.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Claudio; Milrad, Marcelo; Nussbaum, Miguel. "Collboard: Supporting New Media Literacies and Collaborative Learning Using Digital Pens and Interactive Whiteboards." International Conference on Computers in Education. 2010. Malaysia. Conference Presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be exemplified through something as simple as an online forum, in which writers converse through text to come to conclusions. Another example is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia where authorship is relatively open to the public, so various writers may inform others of their knowledge and build on others' to create a constantly evolving definition and explanation of a certain topic.

Media theory also works well with [[critical pedagogy]] and [[feminist theory in composition|feminist]] theories of composition. These theories challenge traditional notions of hierarchies in relation to certain social groups, like race or gender, and how this affects writing. When in practice, media theory can break down hierarchies in several ways. The first way is tied directly to writing as a product. Critical and feminist theories value texts written in non-traditional ways (for example, narrative essay as a "feminine" writing style versus thesis-driven essay as a "masculine" writing style) and texts written by minorities. Media theory breaks down the hegemony that "pure text" has over other modalities by utilizing "non-traditional" methods and modes of writing through the use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Landow, George P. Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization. Baltimore: JHU Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The second way media theory in practice breaks down hierarchies is tied to writing as a process. There is a democratization to media theory because everyone is involved in the creation and consumption of a text because of common features like public access and interactivity. In terms of concrete pedagogy, Massively Open Online Classrooms (MOOCs) work to break down hierarchies by encouraging learning in an informal setting with partially anonymous users, which potentially allows for minorities to let their voices be heard without worrying about discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, Sharon; Quintana, Alvina; and Smith, Caroline J. ''Feminist Cyberspaces: Pedagogies in Transition''. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
A main critique of media theory in practice deals with time constraints. Many First-Year Composition teachers complain that there is not enough time in the course to teach digital writing in addition to "regular" writing. This often results in the addition of new media production as a last-minute addendum, "as a strategy for adding relevance or interest to a required course. Only rarely does that call address students as producers as well as consumers or critics".&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
Related to this, teachers are also frequently concerned that they do not have the ability or knowledge required to teach writing with new media and multi-modality to students because they are often unfamiliar with constantly evolving technologies.
 
A separate criticism is that new media use allows for more prevalent plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;DeVoss, D. &amp; Rosati, A. (2008). "It wasn't me, was it?": Plagiarism and the web. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 308–325). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; As more information is available on the Internet, it is much easier to simply "copy-paste" data into a new format. Furthermore, the questionable authorship of many digital texts complicates things both in terms of writing and citing works. Multi-media works are especially subject to concern over criticism as appropriation and remixing are rampant and even encouraged in composition classrooms and as debates over [[SOPA]] occur.
 
 
Many word processing programs have also been seen to reinforce norms and hierarchies. For instance, the commonly used spelling and grammar checkers of certain programs can be seen as possibly halting the natural progression of language and the creative use of it by encouraging writers to stay within the realm of standard vernaculars.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, P. &amp; McGee, T. (2008). The politics of the program: MS Word as the invisible grammarian. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 308–325). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, some cite the highly class-based symbolic nature of many digital word processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;Selfe, Cynthia L. and Selfe, Richard. "The Politics of the Interface: Power and Its Exercise in Electronic Contact Zones." Ed. Victor Villanueva &amp; Kristin L. Arola. Urbana: 2011. 739–764. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hierarchies are also potentially reaffirmed with implications of the word "new" in "new media". While media theory aims to expand writers' view of modality, a society caught up in modernism is prone to believe that "newness" will result in social progress, as fostered in this case by technological advances, by equating "new" and "better".&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, class-based issues of access may serve to reinforce existing social structures; as those who are unable to access advanced technology fall behind in composition-based technological capabilities, they will be less able to compete in the job market and are likely to reaffirm the separation between classes. This is especially true in K–12 writing programs, as there are often economic differences between students and school districts. However, issues of access are disputed as technology becomes more available to the general public. Patricia Fitzsimmons-Hunter and Charles Moran, aware of these issues of access and their inevitable consequences, notably use technology that is friendlier to class-differences:
"We consider as our goal the integration of low-end, relatively affordable technology into the lives and work of those who are, or see themselves as being, left behind by the pace of the technological change: "roadkill," to use a popular contemporary metaphor, on the information superhighway."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons-Hunter, Patricia and Moran Charles. "Writing Teachers, Schools, Access, and Change." Literacy Theory in the Age of the Internet. Eds. Todd Taylor and Irene Ward. New York: Columbia, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the most cited shortcomings of new media composition is that many teachers are unsure how to assess the writing. Oftentimes, teachers are only familiar with the standards that traditional text is held to. Texts written in new media encounter different rhetorical situations and contexts, and thus do not fit the standards that teachers are familiar with. Furthermore, these new texts often combine text with non-textual modes of communication, like the visual or auditory, making the situation for grading a "written work" even more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Sorapure, Madeleine. "Between Modes: Assessing Student New Media Compositions." Kairos. 10(2): 2006. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6505">Memória Abierta is an alliance of Argentine human rights organizations that promotes the memory of recent human rights violations, actions of resistance and struggles for truth and justice. It contributes to the promotion of human rights and seeks to promote reflection on the present.

It was created in 1999 and is currently composed of eight human rights organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorias urbanas en diálogo: Berlín y Buenos Aires|last=Birle et al.|first=Peter|publisher=Heinrich Boll Stiftung|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Permanent Assembly for Human Rights]], Buena Memoria Civil Association, [[:es:Centro_de_Estudios_Legales_y_Sociales|Center for Legal and Social Studies]], [[:es:El_Vesubio_(centro_de_detención)|Vesubio]] and Puente 12 Victims' Tribute Commission, Commission for Memory, Truth and Justice of the Northern Zone, Relatives of Disappeared and Arrested for Political Reasons, Historical and Social Memory Foundation of Argentina, [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] - Founding Line and [[Servicio Paz y Justicia|Service Peace and Justice]].

== History ==

In 1999, a group of human rights organizations began to meet, seeking to participate in a coordinated way in local and national initiatives in favor of the memory of the last dictatorship in Argentina. The main objective was to contribute to the elaboration of the memory of what happened during State terrorism and to the construction of a later democracy to strengthen and promote respect for human rights. The participating organizations came together with the conviction that a joint action would make them stronger in their struggle.

The initial work of Memoria Abierta included actions aimed at founding a Memory Museum, an extensive program of archival treatment of historical-institutional documents of human rights organizations and the construction of an Oral Archive of testimonies in film format on State terrorism. Later on were added works towards the task of systematization of photographs in a Photographic Archive and the production resources for the visualization of spaces of repression and resistance and their transformation into memory sites.

Memoria Abierta participated in the founding of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/es/inicio/|title=Sites of Conscience|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this space, coordinates the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Sites of Memory promoting the development of initiatives that stimulate reflection on human rights violations committed in these countries and their consequences in the present.

== Archives ==

Memoria Abierta implements a documentary treatment program. In this framework, it established common guidelines and standards for the cataloging and standardization of the different archives it gathers (documentaries, photographic, audiovisual). It applies international standards of description and a specialized Thesauri on Human Rights.

The Oral Archive of Memoria Abierta produces and gives access to testimonies related to the period of State terrorism, to the social and political life of the 1960s and 1970s and to the different actions promoted by human rights organizations and civil society in the search for truth and justice. It is composed of interviews to people whose lives have been affected in various ways by state terrorism. These testimonies are ordered, cataloged and arranged for public consultation in order to facilitate the study and interpretation of Argentine recent past from the point of view of the actors involved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Ashes of History: Loss and Recovery of Archives and Libraries in Modern Latin America|last=Aguirre Carlos|first=Javier VillaFlores|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Memoria Abierta archives were included in the "Memory of the World" Register of the UNESCO as part of the "Documentary Heritage on Human Rights in Argentina for the period 1976-1983. Archives for Truth, Memory and Justice in the face of State terrorism".

== Sites ==

It produces tools that make "visible" the sites used by repression. Identifies together with local counterparts, Clandestine Detention Centers in the Argentine territory and collaborates in the recovery processes of these places to turn them into memory sites. 

Memoria Abierta elaborates different types of resources that are regularly incorporated into the processes of judging the crimes of the dictatorship since the mid-2000s, at the request of the investigating magistrates or courts that are involved in oral and public trials in different parts of the country. Memoria Abierta also participate in judicial investigations through expert reports, archival advice and the supply of documentation requested by the courts

== International Work ==

Memoria Abierta works in partnership to rebuild social trust and promote cooperation within civil society and with state entities in a process of strengthening democratic institutions. It maintains different links and develops projects and activities with different organizations with the objective of exchanging and sharing their experience and work methodologies, as well as the characteristics of the Argentine process of truth and justice with other transitional processes of the world.

In this context, it shares strategies, lessons learned and specific methodologies related to the organization and preservation of archives (including oral archives), to topographic research with different sites within Argentina, in the region and in different countries of the world. ,

The institutions that make up the Latin American and Caribbean Network, which Memoria Abierta has been coordinating since 2006, are working to recover and construct collective reports on the serious violations of human rights and resistance in the region during the recent past, in periods of State terrorism, internal armed conflict and high levels of impunity, with the aim of promoting democracy and guarantees of non-repetition. The Latin American and Caribbean Network of Memory Sites develops projects, initiatives, joint trainings that seek to strengthen the integration between institutions with similar perspectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">The '''Moscow Conceptualist''', or '''Russian Conceptualist''', movement began with the [[Sots art]] of [[Komar and Melamid]] in the early 1970s, and continued as a trend in [[Russian art]] into the 1980s.  It attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]].

The central figures were [[Dmitri Prigov]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Irina Nakhova]], [[Viktor Pivovarov]], [[Eric Bulatov]], [[Andrei Monastyrski]] and [[Komar and Melamid]].

[[Mikhail Epstein]], in ''After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture'' (1995) explains why conceptualism is particularly appropriate to the culture and history of Russia, but also how it differs from Western Conceptualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the West, conceptualism substitutes "one thing for another"--a real object for its verbal description. But in Russia the object that should be replaced is simply absent.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epstein (1995) quotes [[Ilya Kabakov]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“This contiguity, closeness, touchingness, contact with nothing, emptiness makes up, we feel, the basic peculiarity of 'Russian conceptualism'... It is like something that hangs in the air, a self-reliant thing, like a fantastic construction, connected to nothing, with its roots in nothing... So, then, we can say that our own local thinking, from the very beginning in fact, could have been called 'conceptualism'.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19051">Some of the basic concepts of [[general relativity]] can be outlined outside the [[Special relativity|relativistic]] domain. In particular, the idea that mass–energy generates [[curvature]] in [[Spacetime|space]] and that curvature affects the motion of masses can be illustrated in a [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] setting. We use [[circular orbits]] as our prototype. This has the advantage that we know the kinetics of circular orbits. This allows us to calculate curvature of orbits in space directly and compare the results with dynamical forces.

&lt;div class="noprint" style="clear:right;"&gt;{{General relativity sidebar}}
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

==The equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass==

A unique feature of the gravitational force is that all massive objects accelerate in the same manner in a gravitational field. This is often expressed as "The gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass." This allows us to think of gravity as a curvature of [[spacetime]]. {{Citation needed|reason= source needed to establish a link between equivalence principle and gravity as a curvature of space-time |date=June 2016}}

==Test for flatness in spacetime==

If initially parallel paths of two particles on nearby geodesics remain parallel within some accuracy, then spacetime is flat to within that accuracy. [Ref. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;30]

==Two nearby particles in a radial gravitational field==

===Newtonian mechanics for circular orbits===

[[Image:General relativity rdj 3.png|frame|right|Circular orbits at the same radius.]]

====The geodesic and field equations for circular orbits====

Consider the situation in which there are two particles in nearby [[Circular orbit|circular]] [[Polar orbit|polar]] orbits of the Earth at radius &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; and speed &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Since the orbits are circular, the gravitational force on the particles must equal the [[centripetal force]],

:&lt;math&gt; {v^2 \over r} = {GM \over r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the earth.

The particles execute [[simple harmonic motion]] about the earth and with respect to each other. They are at their maximum distance from each other as they cross the equator. Their [[Trajectory|trajectories]] intersect at the poles.

From [[Gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] the separation vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h} &lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be given by the "geodesic equation"

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 \mathbf{h} \over d\tau^2} + R \mathbf{h} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R = {1 \over r^2 } {v^2 \over c^2 }&lt;/math&gt; is the [[curvature]] of the trajectory and &lt;math&gt; \tau = ct &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] c times the time.

The curvature of the trajectory is generated by the mass of the earth &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. This is represented by the "field equation"

:&lt;math&gt; R = {GM \over { r^3} } &lt;/math&gt;

In this example, the field equation is simply a statement of the Newtonian concept that centripetal force is equal to gravitational force for circular orbits. We refer to this expression as a field equation in order to highlight the similarities with the [[Einstein field equation]]. This equation is in a much different form than [[Gauss's law for gravity|Gauss's law]], which is the usual characterization of the field equation in Newtonian mechanics.

[[Image:General relativity rdj 5.png|frame|right|The position of the moving particle with respect to the particle at rest in the co-moving reference frame.]]

====Relationship between curvature and mass density====
Mass can be written in terms of the average mass density &lt;math&gt; \rho (r) &lt;/math&gt; inside a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; by the expression

:&lt;math&gt; M = {4\pi\rho (r) r^3 \over 3 } &lt;/math&gt;.

The field equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt; R = {4 \pi G \over {3 } } \rho (r) &lt;/math&gt;.

The curvature of the particle trajectories is proportional to mass density.

====Local measurements====

A requirement of General Relativity is that all measurements must be made locally. We can therefore imagine that the particles are inside a windowless spacecraft co-orbiting the earth with the [[center of mass]] of the spacecraft coincident with one of the particles. That particle would be at rest with respect to the spacecraft. An observer in the spacecraft would have no indication that the craft was orbiting the earth. The observer is only allowed to measure the behavior of the particles in the frame of the craft.

In this example, we can define a local coordinate system such that the &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt;-direction is toward the ceiling of the craft and this is directed along &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;-direction is toward the front of the craft and is in the direction of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;-direction is toward the left side of the craft.

In this frame, the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h} &lt;/math&gt; is the position vector for the second particle. An observer in the craft would think the second particle was oscillating in a [[potential well]] generated by a gravitational field. This is an example of a [[General relativity|coordinate acceleration]] due to the choice of frames as opposed to a physical acceleration due to actual forces.

===General motion in the earth's gravitational field===

====Elliptic and hyberbolic trajectories====

[[Image:General relativity rdj 6.png|frame|right|Co-planar elliptic orbits. The particle in the outer orbit travels slower than the particle in the inner orbit. They will separate with time.]]
More generally, particles move in [[Elliptic orbit|elliptic]] or [[Hyperbolic orbit|hyberbolic]] trajectories in a plane that contains the earth center. The orbits need not be [[Circular orbit|circular]]. One can obtain intuitive geodesic and field equations in those situations as well [Ref 2, Chapter 1]. Unlike circular orbits, however, the speed of the particles in elliptic or hyperbolic trajectories is not constant. We therefore do not have a constant speed with which to scale the curvature. Therefore, in anticipation of the transition to relativistic mechanics, the trajectories and curvatures are scaled with the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;.

From Newton's Law of Gravitation

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 \mathbf{r} \over dt^2} = - {GM \over r^3}\mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;

one can obtain the geodesic equation for the separation of two particles in nearby trajectories

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 \mathbf{h} \over d\tau^2} + R \mathbf{h} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and the field equation

:&lt;math&gt; R = R_{\perp} = {GM \over {c^2 r^3}} = {4 \pi G \over {3 c^2 } }\rho (r) &lt;/math&gt;

if the particle separation is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; R = R_{\|} = -{2GM \over {c^2 r^3}} = -{8 \pi G \over {3 c^2 } }\rho (r) &lt;/math&gt;

if the separation is parallel to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;. In the calculation of &lt;math&gt; R_{\|} &lt;/math&gt; the radius was [[Taylor expansion|expanded]] in terms of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h} &lt;/math&gt;. Only the [[Linear function|linear]] term was retained.

In the case that the separation of the particle is radial, the curvature is negative. This will cause the particles to separate rather than to be drawn toward each other as in the case in which they have the same radius. This is easy to understand. Outer orbits travel slower than inner orbits. This leads to particle separation.

====Local coordinate system====

[[Image:General relativity rdj 7.png|frame|right|Local "diagonal" coordinate system for an elliptic orbit.]]
A local coordinate system for a space craft co-moving with one of the particles can again be defined. The &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt;-direction, toward the ceiling, is in the direction of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;-direction, toward the front of the craft, is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt; but still in the plane of the trajectory. Unlike in a circular orbit, this craft no longer necessarily points in the direction of the velocity. The &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;-direction is toward the left side of the craft.

==Tensor description==

===Simple diagonal frame===

The geodesic equation in a radial gravitational field can be described succinctly in [[tensor]] notation [Ref. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;37] in the co-moving frame in which the ceiling of the space craft is in the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat r} &lt;/math&gt; direction

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 h^i \over ds^2} + R^i_j h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the Latin indices are over the spatial directions in the co-moving system, and we have used the [[Einstein summation convention]] in which repeated indices are summed. The curvature tensor &lt;math&gt; R^i_j &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{Vmatrix} R^1_1 &amp; R^2_1 &amp; R^3_1\\ R^1_2 &amp; R^2_2 &amp; R^3_2\\ R^1_3 &amp; R^2_3 &amp; R^3_3 \end{Vmatrix} = \begin{Vmatrix} R_\perp &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; R_\perp &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; R_\| \end{Vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and the separation vector is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{Vmatrix} h^1 &amp; h^2 &amp; h^3\end{Vmatrix} = \begin{Vmatrix} \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat x} &amp; \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat y} &amp; \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat z}\end{Vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat x} &lt;/math&gt; is the component of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h} &lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat x} &lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat y} &lt;/math&gt; is the component in the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat y} &lt;/math&gt; direction, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}\cdot\mathbf{\hat z} &lt;/math&gt; is the component in the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat z} &lt;/math&gt; direction.

In this co-moving coordinate system the curvature tensor is diagonal. This is not true in general.

===Arbitrary orientation of the local frame===

The co-moving spacecraft has no windows. An observer is not able to tell which direction is the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat r} &lt;/math&gt; direction, nor can he/she know which direction is the velocity with respect to earth. The orientation of the spacecraft may be quite different from the simple coordinate system in which the ceiling is in the &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat r} &lt;/math&gt; direction and the front of the craft is in a direction coplanar with the radius and the velocity. We can transform our simple coordinates to an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system through [[Rotation matrix|rotations]]. This, however, destroys the diagonal nature of the curvature matrix.

Rotations are performed with a [[rotation matrix]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; such that the separation vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar h} &lt;/math&gt; is related to the separation vector before rotation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h} &lt;/math&gt; by the relation

:&lt;math&gt; \bar h^i = \mathcal{M}^i_jh^j &lt;/math&gt;.

The inverse &lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathcal{M}} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathcal{M}}^i_j \mathcal{M}^j_k = \delta^i_k &lt;/math&gt;,

which yields

:&lt;math&gt; h^i = \bar{\mathcal{M}}^i_j \bar h^j &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt; \delta^i_k &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

A simple rotation matrix that rotates the coordinate axis through an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;-axis is

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{Vmatrix}\mathcal{M}^1_1 &amp; \mathcal{M}^2_1 &amp; \mathcal{M}^3_1\\ \mathcal{M}^1_2 &amp; \mathcal{M}^2_2 &amp; \mathcal{M}^3_2\\ \mathcal{M}^1_3 &amp; \mathcal{M}^2_3 &amp; \mathcal{M}^3_3 \end{Vmatrix} = \begin{Vmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \cos(\theta ) &amp; \sin(\theta )\\ 0 &amp; -\sin(\theta ) &amp; \cos(\theta )\end{Vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

This is a rotation in the y-z plane. The inverse is obtained by switching the sign of &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;.

If the rotation matrix does not depend on time then the geodisic equation becomes, upon rotation

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 \bar h^i \over ds^2} + \bar R^i_j \bar h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \bar R^i_j = \mathcal{M}^i_k R^k_l \bar{\mathcal{M}}^l_j &lt;/math&gt;.

The curvature in the new coordinate system is non-diagonal. The inverse problem of transforming an arbitray coordinate system into a diagonal system can be performed mathematically with the process of [[Diagonal matrix|diagonalization]].

[[Image:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Diagram 1. Changing views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer.
In this animation, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("[[world line]]") of a particle. The balls are placed at regular intervals of [[proper time]] along the world line. The solid diagonal lines are the [[light cone]]s for the observer's current event, and intersect at that event. The small dots are other arbitrary events in the spacetime. For the observer's current instantaneous inertial frame of reference, the vertical direction indicates the time and the horizontal direction indicates distance.
The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) is the velocity of the particle on that section of the world line. So at a bend in the world line the particle is being accelerated. Note how the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates, changing the instantaneous inertial frame of reference. These changes are governed by the Lorentz transformations. Also note that:&lt;br&gt;
• the balls on the world line before/after future/past accelerations are more spaced out due to time dilation.&lt;br&gt;
• events which were simultaneous before an acceleration are at different times afterwards (due to the [[relativity of simultaneity]]),&lt;br&gt;
• events pass through the light cone lines due to the progression of proper time, but not due to the change of views caused by the accelerations,and&lt;br&gt;
• the world line always remains within the future and past light cones of the current event.]]

===Time dependent rotation of the local frame: Christoffel symbols===

The space craft may tumble about its center of mass. In that case the rotation matrix is time dependent. If the rotation matrix is time dependent, then it does not [[Commutative operation|commute]] with the time derivative.

In that case, the rotation of the separation velocity can be written

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}^k_i {d h^i \over ds} = \mathcal{M}^k_i {d \bar{\mathcal{M}}^i_j \bar h^j \over ds} &lt;/math&gt;

which becomes

:&lt;math&gt; {d \bar h^k \over ds} + \Gamma^k_j \bar h^j \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {D \bar h^k \over Ds}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^k_j \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathcal{M}^k_i {d \bar{\mathcal{M}}^i_j \over ds} &lt;/math&gt;

is known as a [[Christoffel symbol]].

The geodesic equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt; {D^2 \bar h^i \over Ds^2} + \bar R^i_j \bar h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,

which is the same as before with the exception that the derivatives have been generalized.

===Arbitrariness in the curvature===

The velocity in the frame of the spacecraft can be written

:&lt;math&gt; \bar u^i \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {D \bar h^i \over Ds} &lt;/math&gt;.

The geodesic equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt; {d \bar u^i \over ds} + \Gamma^i_j \bar u^j + \bar R^i_j \bar h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 \bar h^i \over ds^2} + 2 \Gamma^i_j {d \bar h^i \over ds} + {d \Gamma^i_j \over ds} \bar h^j + \Gamma^i_j \Gamma^j_k \bar h^k + \bar R^i_j \bar h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

In an arbitrarily rotating spacecraft, the curvature of space is due to two terms, one due to the mass density and one due to the arbitrary rotation of the spacecraft. The arbitrary rotation is non-physical and must be eliminated in any real physical theory of gravitation. In General Relativity this is done with a process called [[Fermi–Walker transport]]. In a [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] sense, Fermi–Walker transport is simply a statement that the spacecraft is not allowed to tumble

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all i and j. The only time-dependent rotations allowed are those generated by the mass density.

==General geodesic and field equations in a Newtonian setting==

===Geodesic equation===

:&lt;math&gt; {D^2 \bar h^i \over Ds^2} + \bar R^i_j \bar h^j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; {D \over Ds} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {d \over ds} + \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Christoffel symbol]].

===Field equation===

:&lt;math&gt; \bar R^i_j = \mathcal{M}^i_k R^k_l \bar{\mathcal{M}}^l_j &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}^i_j &lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix and the curvature tensor is

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{Vmatrix} R^1_1 &amp; R^2_1 &amp; R^3_1\\ R^1_2 &amp; R^2_2 &amp; R^3_2\\ R^1_3 &amp; R^2_3 &amp; R^3_3 \end{Vmatrix} = \begin{Vmatrix} R_\perp &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; R_\perp &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; R_\| \end{Vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

The curvature is proportional to the mass density

:&lt;math&gt; R_{\perp} = {4 \pi G \over {3 c^2 } }\rho (r) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_{\|} = -{8 \pi G \over {3 c^2 } }\rho (r) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Overview of the Newtonian picture===

The geodesic and field equations simply are a restatement of Newton's Law of Gravitation as seen from a local frame of reference co-moving with the mass within the local frame. This picture contains many of the elements of General Relativity, including the concept that particles travel along geodesics in a curved space (spacetime in the relativistic case) and that the curvature is due to the presence of mass density (mass/energy density in the relativistic case). This picture also contains some of the mathematical machinery of General Relativity such as [[tensor]]s, [[Christoffel symbol]]s, and [[Fermi–Walker transport]].

==Relativistic generalization==

{{main|Theoretical motivation for general relativity}}

[[Image:060322 helix.svg|thumb|275px|right|World line of a circular orbit about the Earth depicted in two spatial dimensions X and Y (the plane of the orbit) and a time dimension, usually put as the vertical axis. Note that the orbit about the Earth is (almost) a circle in space, but its worldline is a helix in spacetime.]]
General relativity generalizes the [[geodesic equation]] and the [[Einstein field equation|field equation]] to the relativistic realm in which trajectories in space are replaced with [[world line]]s in [[spacetime]]. The equations are also generalized to more complicated curvatures.

==The Τwenty-Five Lessons==
Kurlansky summarizes the Twenty-Five Lessons as follows:&lt;ref&gt;At the end of the book&lt;/ref&gt; 
# There is no proactive word for nonviolence [in English].
# Nations that build military forces as deterrents will eventually use them.
# Practitioners of nonviolence are seen as enemies of the state.
# Once a state takes over a religion, the religion loses its nonviolent teachings.
# A rebel can be defanged and co-opted by making him a saint after he is dead.
# Somewhere behind every war there are always a few founding lies.
# A propaganda machine promoting hatred always has a war waiting in the wings.
# People who go to war start to resemble their enemy.  
# A conflict between a violent and a nonviolent force is a moral argument. If the violent side can provoke the nonviolent side into violence, the violent side has won.
# The problem lies not in the nature of man, but in the nature of power.
# The longer a war lasts, the less popular it becomes.
# The state imagines it is impotent without a military because it can not conceive of power without force.
# It is often not the largest, but the best organized and most articulate group that prevails.
# All debate momentarily ends with an enforced silence once the first shots are fired.
# A shooting war is not necessary to overthrow an established power, but is used to consolidate the revolution itself.
# Violence does not resolve; it always leads to more violence.
# Warfare produces peace activists. A group of veterans is a likely place to find peace activists.
# People motivated by fear do not act well.
# While it is perfectly feasible to convince a people faced with brutal oppression to rise up in a suicidal attack on their oppressor, it is almost impossible to convince them to meet deadly violence with nonviolent resistance. 
# Wars do not have to be sold to the general public if they can be carried out by an all-volunteer professional military.
# Once you start the business of killing, you just get deeper and deeper without limits.
# Violence always comes with a supposedly rational explanation, which is only dismissed as irrational if the violence fails.
# Violence is a virus that infects and takes over.
# The miracle is that despite all of society's promotion of warfare, most soldiers find warfare to be a wrenching departure from their own moral values.
# The hard work of beginning a movement to end war has already been done.

{{Quantum mechanics}}

In [[physics]], the '''observer effect''' is the theory that simply observing a situation or [[phenomenon]] necessarily changes that phenomenon. This is often the result of instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner. A commonplace example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some of the air, thus changing the pressure. Similarly, it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object, and causing it to reflect that light. While the effects of observation are oftentimes negligible, the object still experiences a change. This effect can be found in many domains of physics, but can usually be reduced to insignificance by using different instruments or observation techniques. 

An especially unusual version of the observer effect occurs in [[quantum mechanics]], as best demonstrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively 'ruling out' all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. A particularly famous example is the 1998 Weizmann experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Quantum Theory Demonstrated: Observation Affects Reality | date=27 Feb 1998 | author=Weizmann Institute Of Science | journal=Science Daily | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the "observer" in this experiment being an electronic detector&amp;mdash;possibly due to the assumption that the word "observer" implies a person&amp;mdash;its results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mystery of the Quantum World | author=Squires, Euan J. | year=1994 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PinUwd99CV8C | chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the "observer" to be conscious has been rejected by mainstream science as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function {{mvar|ψ}} and the quantum measurement process,&lt;ref&gt;"Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and ''it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being''; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual," is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory." - [[Werner Heisenberg]], ''Physics and Philosophy'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer - with a PhD?" -[[John Stewart Bell]], 1981, ''Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists''. In C.J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W. Sciama (eds.), 
''Quantum Gravity 2: A second Oxford Symposium''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p.611.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to standard quantum mechanics,  it is a matter of complete indifference whether the experimenters stay around to watch their experiment, or leave the room and delegate observing to an inanimate apparatus, instead, which amplifies the microscopic events to macroscopic  measurements and records them by a time-irreversible process ({{Cite book|title = Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy|last = Bell|first = John|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 9780521523387|pages = 170}}). The measured state is not interfering with the states excluded by the measurement. As [[Richard Feynman]] put it: "Nature does not know what you are looking at, and she behaves the way she is going to behave whether you bother to take down the data or not." ({{Cite book|title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III|last = Feynman|first = Richard|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2015|isbn = 9780465040834|location =Ch 3.2 |pages = }}).&lt;/ref&gt; apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect.

==Particle physics==
For an [[electron]] to become detectable, a [[photon]] must first interact with it, and this interaction will inevitably change the path of that electron. It is also possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the measured value of a quantity and the value resulting from the measurement process. In particular, a measurement of momentum is non-repeatable in short intervals of time. A formula (one-dimensional for simplicity) relating involved quantities, due to [[Niels Bohr]] (1928) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|v'_x - v_x|\Delta p_x \approx \hbar/\Delta t,&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:Δ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is uncertainty in measured value of momentum,
:Δ''t'' is duration of measurement,
:''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is velocity of particle ''before'' measurement,
:{{SubSup|''v''|''x''|'}} is velocity of particle ''after'' measurement,
: {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced [[Planck constant]].

The ''measured'' momentum of the electron is then related to {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, whereas its momentum ''after'' the measurement is related to {{math|''v''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is a best-case scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|first1=L.D.|last1=Landau|authorlink1=Lev Landau|first2=E. M.|last2=Lifshitz|authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz|translator-last1=Sykes|translator-first1=J. B.|translator-last2=Bell|translator-first2=J. S.|translator-link2=John Stewart Bell|year=1977|title=Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory|edition=3rd|volume=Vol. 3|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|isbn=978-0-08-020940-1|at=§7, §44|url=https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanics_104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics==
In [[electronics]], [[ammeter]]s and [[voltmeter]]s are usually wired in series or parallel to the circuit, and so by their very presence affect the current or the voltage they are measuring by way of presenting an additional real or complex [[Electrical load|load]] to the circuit, thus changing the [[transfer function]] and behavior of the circuit itself. Even a more passive device such as a [[current clamp]], which measures the wire current without coming into physical contact with the wire, affects the current through the circuit being measured because the [[mutual inductance|inductance is mutual]].

==Thermodynamics==
In [[thermodynamics]], a standard [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] must absorb or give up some [[thermal energy]] to record a [[temperature]], and therefore changes the temperature of the body which it is measuring.

==Quantum mechanics==
The theoretical foundation of the concept of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]] is a contentious issue deeply connected to the many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. A key focus point is that of [[wave function collapse]], for which several popular interpretations assert that measurement causes a ''discontinuous change'' into an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Schr.C3.B6dinger equation|eigenstate]] of the operator associated with the quantity that was measured, a change which is not time-reversible.

More explicitly, the [[quantum superposition|superposition]] principle ({{math|''ψ'' {{=}} Σ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} of quantum physics dictates that for a wave function {{mvar|ψ}}, a measurement will result in a state of the quantum system of one of the {{mvar|m}} possible eigenvalues {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; , n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''m''}}, of the operator{{math|{{overset|&amp;and;|''F''}} }} which in the space of the eigenfunctions {{math|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; , n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''m''}}.

Once one has measured the system, one knows its current state; and this prevents it from being in one of its other state ⁠— it has apparently [[decoherence|decohered]] from them without prospects of future strong quantum interference.&lt;ref name="Quantum Theory and Pictures of Reality"&gt;B.D'Espagnat, P.Eberhard, W.Schommers, [[Franco Selleri|F.Selleri]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the type of measurement one performs on the system affects the end-state of the system.

An experimentally studied situation related to this is the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which a quantum state would decay if left alone, but does not decay because of its continuous observation. The dynamics of a quantum system under continuous observation are described by a quantum [[stochastic]] master equation known as the [[Belavkin equation]].&lt;ref name=Belavkin89&gt;{{cite journal

When discussing the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} which describes the state of a system in quantum mechanics, one should be cautious of a common misconception that assumes that the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} amounts to the same thing as the physical object it describes. This flawed concept must then require existence of an external mechanism, such as the mind of a conscious observer, that lies outside the principles governing the time evolution of the wave function {{mvar|ψ}}, in order to account for the so-called "collapse of the wave function" after a measurement has been performed. But the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} is ''not a physical object'' like, for example, an atom, which has an observable mass, charge and spin, as well as internal degrees of freedom. Instead, {{mvar|ψ}} is an ''abstract mathematical function'' that contains all the ''statistical'' information that an observer can obtain from measurements of a given system. In this case, there is no real mystery in that this mathematical form of the wave function {{mvar|ψ}} must change abruptly after a measurement has been performed.

In the ambit of the so-called [[hidden-measurements interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, the observer-effect can be understood as an ''instrument effect'' which results from the combination of the following two aspects: (a) an invasiveness of the measurement process, intrinsically incorporated in its experimental protocol (which therefore cannot be eliminated); (b) the presence of a random mechanism (due to fluctuations in the experimental context) through which a specific measurement-interaction is each time actualized, in a non-predictable (non-controllable) way.&lt;ref name=Sassoli2013&gt;Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2013). The Observer Effect. [[Foundations of Science]] 18, pp. 213-243, arXiv:1109.3536.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sassoli2014&gt;Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2015). God may not play dice, but human observers surely do. [[Foundations of Science]] 20, pp. 77-105, arXiv:1208.0674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AertsSassoli2014d&gt;Aerts, D. and Sassoli de Bianchi, M.

A consequence of [[Bell's theorem]] is that measurement on one of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles can appear to have a nonlocal effect on the other particle. Additional problems related to [[quantum decoherence#In interpretations of quantum mechanics|decoherence]] arise when the observer is modeled as a quantum system, as well.
{{see also|Quantum decoherence|Delayed choice quantum eraser}}

The [[uncertainty principle]] has been frequently confused with the observer effect, evidently even by its originator, [[Werner Heisenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|last=Furuta|first=Aya|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty principle in its standard form describes how [[accuracy and precision|precisely]] we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the precision in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose precision in measuring the other.&lt;ref name="heisenberg"&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930), ''Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie'', Leipzig: Hirzel English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930. reprinted Dover 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ornament and Crime'''" is an essay and lecture by modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] that criticizes [[ornament (art)|ornament]] in useful objects.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in ''Les Cahiers d’aujourd’hui'' in French as "Ornement et Crime". Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', as "Ornament und Verbrechen". It was the architect [[Henry Kulka]], who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in ''Trotzdem'', that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the [[Secession (art)|Secessionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, [http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&amp;name=ACSA.AM.85.107.pdf “Ornament, Crime, Myth, and Meaning”], ''85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay was written when [[Art Nouveau]]—known as [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], which would be fundamental to the [[Bauhaus]] design studio, and would help define the ideology of [[Modern architecture|modernism in architecture]].

"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects," Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying [[evolution]] to cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, Andrew Herscher, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/docs/canales-Criminal%20Skins.pdf "Criminal Skins: Tattoos and Modern Architecture in the Work of Adolf Loos"], ''Architectural History'' 48, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Wise|first=Michael |date=4 December 2013 |title=Reassessing an Uproar in Architecture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/garden/reassessing-an-uproar-in-architecture.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the [[tattoo]]ing of the "[[Papuan peoples|Papuan]]" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Loos|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175309/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rawson&gt;{{cite book | last = Rawson | first = Jessica | |authorlink= Jessica Rawson |title = Chinese ornament: the lotus and the dragon | publisher = British Museum Publications | location = London | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-7141-1431-6 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Loos concluded that "No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength".&lt;ref name=rawson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">A '''process flow diagram''' ('''PFD''') is a diagram commonly used in [[chemical engineering|chemical]] and [[process engineering]] to indicate the general flow of plant processes and equipment. The PFD displays the relationship between ''major'' equipment of a plant facility and does not show minor details such as piping details and designations. Another commonly used term for a PFD is a ''flowsheet''.

==Typical content of a process flow diagram==
[[File:pfd-symbols.png|thumb|right|350px|Some typical elements from process flow diagrams, as provided by the [[Open-source software|open source]] program, [[Dia (software)|Dia]]. Click for image legend.]]

Typically, process flow diagrams of a single [[unit process]] will include the following:
* Process [[piping]]
* Major equipment items
* [[Control valves]] and other major [[valves]]
* Connections with other systems
* Major bypass and recirculation (recycle) streams
* Operational data ([[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[mass flow rate]], [[density]], etc.), often by stream references to a [[mass balance]].
* Process stream names

Process flow diagrams generally do not include:
* [[Pipe class]]es  or piping line numbers
* [[Process control]] instrumentation (sensors and final elements)
* Minor bypass lines
* Isolation and shutoff valves
* Maintenance vents and drains
* [[Relief valve|Relief]] and [[safety valve]]s
* [[Flange]]s

Process flow diagrams of multiple process units within a large industrial plant will usually contain less detail and may be called ''block flow diagrams'' or ''schematic flow diagrams''.

==Process flow diagram examples==

The process flow diagram below depicts a single chemical engineering unit process known as an [[Amine treating|amine treating plant]]:

=== Multiple process units within an industrial plant ===
The process flow diagram below is an example of a schematic or block flow diagram and depicts the various unit processes within a typical [[oil refinery]]:

==Other items of interest==
A PFD can be computer generated from process simulators (see [[List of Chemical Process Simulators]]), CAD packages, or flow chart software using a library of chemical engineering symbols. Rules and symbols are available from standardization organizations such as [[DIN]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[ANSI]].  Often PFDs are produced on large sheets of paper.

PFDs of many commercial processes can be found in the literature, specifically in encyclopedias of chemical technology, although some might be outdated. To find recent ones, patent databases such as those available from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] can be useful.

==Standards==
* ISO 10628: Flow Diagrams For Process Plants - General Rules
* ANSI Y32.11: Graphical Symbols For Process Flow Diagrams (withdrawn 2003)
* SAA AS 1109: Graphical Symbols For Process Flow Diagrams For The Food Industry

'''Quamina Gladstone''', most often referred to simply as '''Quamina''', was a [[British Guiana|Guianese]] slave, a [[Coromantee]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} who was father of [[Jack Gladstone]]. He and his son were involved in the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]], one of the largest [[slave revolts]] in the [[Crown colony|British colonies]] before slavery was abolished.

He was a carpenter by trade, and worked on an estate owned by [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]]. Quamina was implicated in the revolt by the colonial authorities, apprehended and executed on 16 September 1823. He is considered a national hero in Guyana, and there are streets in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] and the village of Beterverwagting on the East Coast Demerara, named after him.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

== Biography ==
Quamina&lt;ref&gt;"Quamina" corresponds to Kwamena, a name of Ghanaian origin denoting a male born on Saturday. See [[Akan names]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a carpenter who lived and worked on the "Success" plantation in [[Demerara]].&lt;ref name=abolproject&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/resistance_53.html |title=Case Study 3: Demerara (1823) – Quamina and John Smith |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=The Abolition Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stabroek&gt;McGowan, Winston (30 August 2007).

His mother died on a plantation in 1817.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In some source material, he is surnamed Gladstone, as the enslaved adopted surnames of their masters by convention. [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]], who had never set foot on his plantation, had acquired half share in the plantation in 1812 through mortgage default; he acquired the remaining half four years later.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/view/3455/4216 |format=pdf |first=Richard B. |last=Sheridan |title=The Condition of slaves on the sugar plantations of Sir John Gladstone in the colony of Demerara 1812 to 1849 |journal=[[New West Indian Guide]] |volume=76 |year=2002 |number= 3/4 |pages= 243–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended services at the Bethel Chapel of the [[London Missionary Society]] on neighbouring Le Resouvenir plantation when the chapel opened in 1808.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; Under the guidance of Reverend John Wray,&lt;ref name=guyana/&gt; he learned to read and write.&lt;ref name=dacosta181&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyanacaribbeannetwork.com/ourfeature.08.04.08.htm |title=PART II Blood, sweat, tears and the struggle for basic human rights |publisher=Guyana Caribbean Network |accessdate=21 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was witnessed in a letter he wrote to the LMS, he was persuaded to attend the recently opened church by the person who he served as apprentice.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; Wray noticed positive changes after he became Christian.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; Quamina was proud and hardworking, and was baptised on 26 December 1808.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; On being assessed for fitness to become a member, Quamina declared that when he was young, he had been a houseboy and had to "fetch" girls to entertain the estate's managers.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; When Wray was sent to nearby [[Berbice]] in 1816,&lt;ref name=guyana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter41.html |title=The Anti-Slavery Movement in British Guiana |publisher=Guyana News and Information |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; his replacement [[John Smith (missionary)|John Smith]] was equally impressed by Quamina's qualities.&lt;ref name=abolproject/&gt; He took an interest in others, and had become widely respected by slaves and free blacks throughout the colony.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt;&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; One of five slaves elected [[deacon]] by the congregation in 1817,&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina became Smith's personal favourite, and was highly trusted by John Smith and his wife, Jane.&lt;ref name=stabroek3&gt;McGowan, Winston (13 September 2007). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2492&amp;dat=20070913&amp;id=IUZaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oSYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1813,2049664 "The 1823 Demerara slave rebellion (Part 3)"] ''Stabroek News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt; According to da Costa, he was a "loyal, well-behaved, trustworthy and pious deacon." He brought news of the congregation members on a day-to-day basis, and was always consulted about the affairs of any member.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt;

Quamina had many wives, but he cohabited for twenty years with Peggy, a [[freedman|free woman]]. As was common with other slaves, he had been harshly treated and humiliated by his masters and once was beaten badly and incapacitated for six weeks. He was frequently forced to work, thus missing religious services.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; In 1822,&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; when Peggy was taken seriously ill, he was forced to work all day, every day, and was not allowed any time off to look after her. One evening, he returned to find her dead.&lt;ref name="abolproject"/&gt;

== The revolt ==
{{Main|Demerara rebellion of 1823}}
Being very close to Jack, Quamina supported his son's aspirations to be free, by supporting the fight for the rights of slaves. But he was at the same time a rational man.&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been troubled for some time by rumours he had heard about an emancipation ordered by Britain that was being withheld by the colonists. Rev. John Smith noted in a private journal entry on 25 July that Quamina had spoken of the matter. Smith assured him that any announcement would be of measures to improve the slaves' condition, and that the rumours of anticipation were not to be believed.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; He urged him to tell the other slaves, particularly the Christians, not to rebel&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; and sent Manuel and Seaton on this mission. When he knew the rebellion was imminent, he urged restraint, and made the fellow slaves promise a peaceful strike.&lt;ref name=guyana43&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter43.html |title=The Demerara Slave Uprising |publisher=Guyana News and Information |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the planned rebellion had leaked out, and Quamina was arrested by John Stewart, the manager at his plantation, shortly before it was due to start. And although he was set loose by fellow slaves as the rebellion was unfolding, Quamina never took up arms, and even actively prevented from Stewart from coming to any harm.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; After the slaves' defeat in a major battle at "Bachelor's Adventure", Jack fled into the woods. A "handsome reward"&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; of one thousand guilder was offered for the capture of Jack, Quamina and about twenty other "fugitives".&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jack led thousands of slaves in rebellion, most of the colonists thought the reverse – that Quamina was the ultimate leader, and Jack was merely aiding and abetting it.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; Jack and his wife were captured by Capt. McTurk at Chateau Margo on 6 September after a three-hour standoff.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina remained at large until he was captured on 16 September in the fields of Chateau Margo. He was executed, and his body was hung up in chains by the side of a public road in front of "Success".&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very low number of white deaths is proof that the uprising was largely peaceful – plantation owners, managers and their families were locked up and not harmed.&lt;ref name=GCN/&gt; Hundreds of slaves died during the various battles and skirmishes during the revolt, or were executed as "ringleaders". Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to [[Saint Lucia]]. The rebellion helped bring attention to the plight of sugar plantation slaves, accelerating the full [[abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Quamina is considered a national hero in Guyana. In 1985 the post-independence Guyana renamed Murray Street in Georgetown – named for former [[Demerara]] Lieutenant Governor [[John Murray (colonial administrator)|John Murray]] (1813–1824) who was in charge of the colony during the unrest and rebellion – Quamina Street in his honour.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |title=Historic Cummingsburg |publisher=National Trust of Guyana |accessdate=25 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930064245/http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |archivedate=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to him was erected at the junction of Quamina and Carmichael Streets.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guyanaobservernews.org/content/view/1447/1/

'''Retread''', also known as "recap", or a "remold" is a [[re-manufacturing]] process for [[tires]] that replace the [[tread]] on worn tires. Retreading is applied to casings of spent tires that have been inspected and repaired.&lt;ref name=Flapper&gt;{{cite book|last=(eds.)|first=Simme Douwe P. Flapper, Jo A.E.E. van Nunen, Luk N. van Wassenhove,|title=Managing closed-loop supply chains|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3540272518|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XspQ0PUNjvkC&amp;pg=PA119}}&lt;/ref&gt; It preserves about 90% of the material in spent tires and the material cost is about 20% compared to manufacturing a new one.

==Applications==
===United States===
Some applications for retreaded tires are airplanes, racing cars, buses and delivery trucks. Use of retreaded tires was common historically, but as of 2008, it was seldom used for passenger vehicles, mainly due to discomfort on the road, safety issues and cheaper tire brands surfacing on the market. About 17.6 million retreaded tires were sold in North America in 2006.&lt;ref name=Bodziak&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodziak|first=William|title=Tire Tread and Tire Track Evidence: Recovery and Forensic Examination Practical Aspects of Criminal &amp; Forensic Investigations|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1420006827|pages=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRsHlttaMrMC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as [[shearography]] to locate non-visible damage and embedded [[road debris|debris]] and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

Material cost for a retreaded tire is about 20% that of making a new tire.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;
About 90% of the original tires by weight is retained in retreaded tires. A 1997 study estimates that then current generation of commercial vehicles tires to last up to 600,000 miles if they're retreaded two to three times. &lt;ref name=Madu&gt;{{cite book|last=Madu|first=ed. by Christian N.|title=Handbook of environmentally conscious manufacturing|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0792384490|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-R5VOiv1YwC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre cure===
Previously prepared tread strip is applied to [[tire casing]] with [[cement]]. This method allows more flexibility in tire sizes and it is the most commonly used method, but results in a seam where the ends of the strip meet.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

===Mold cure===
Raw rubber is applied to the tire casing and it is then placed in a mold where tread is formed. A dedicated mold is required for each tire size and tread design. 

====Bead to Bead molding====
In this subtype, retreading is also applied to the side walls. These tires are given entirely new branding and stamps. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Regulations==
Some jurisdictions have regulations concerning tire retreading.

===Europe===
In Europe all retreads, by law, must be manufactured according to EC Regulation 108 (car tires) or 109 (commercial vehicle tires). As part of this regulation all tires must be tested according to the same load and speed criteria as those undergone by new tires.

The [[Land Fill Directive]] of 1999 banned tires in landfills in 2003, and banned shredded tires in 2006.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;

===United States===
The [[Department of Transportation]] requires marking of a "DOTR number" which shows the name of the retreader and when it was retreaded. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Safety==
The United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] recognizes the public perception that retread tires frequently used by heavy vehicles are less safe than new tires as evidenced by [[tire debris]] frequently found on highways.  The NHTSA is continuing research to determine the proportion of tire debris from retreads in comparison to new tires. Additionally, the NHTSA is researching the cause of tire failure and the crash safety problem posed by tire failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124610/http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Executive Order 13149 supports the use of retread tires for economic and environmental efficiency by requiring federal vehicles to use retread tires after original factory equipped tires become non serviceable, but only when "such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards".

==Environmental Impact==
Retread tires in service lower the volume of raw materials required for the manufacturing of a new tire. This includes a pronounced reduction in the use of oil. In fact, the US EPA estimated a greater than 70% savings in oil used for a retread as compared to a new tire. This also means significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing the amount of raw materials extracted, retread tires also minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The latest figures by the US EPA indicate that over 11.2 M waste tires were dumped into the U.S. municipal solid waste stream. To understand this figure, it is equivalent to lining up passenger tires tread to tread from roughly Los Angeles to San Diego or Philadelphia to Washington DC. Because a retread tire prevents the need for manufacturing a new tire, significant environmental benefits are achieved. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bandag.com/en-us/research-center/financial-environmental-benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Reese''' (10 March 1921 – 25 October 1990) was an [[African Americans|African American]]-Norwegian singer, writer and civil rights activist. She was one of the first prominent black singers in Norway and was actively involved in the international fight against racism. Over several decades, she contributed significantly to the understanding of African American history and music in Norway.&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/norway/varden/20130920/282986807628587|title=Kristin arvet både kunnskap og Noter av Ruth Reese|publisher=''Varden''|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=8 March 2018 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ruth Reese was born on 10 March 1921 in [[Hayneville, Alabama]] to Sarah (née Hunter) and William Reese.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} In her childhood, the family moved to [[Chicago]], where Reese attended school and sang in the church choir. Without adequate funds to pursue music studies, she worked as a domestic after school to pay for music lessons. After completing her secondary studies,{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} Reese attended [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] earning a bachelor's degree in music.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}

==Career==
After her graduation, Reese first worked as a physical training instructor and choir director at Madden Park,{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1940a|p=40}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1940b|p=6}} before being hired as a substitute teacher{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1948|p=19}} Throughout the 1940s, Reese performed in the Chicago area, entering musical contests, winning several local awards,{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1946|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1948|p=19}}{{sfn|''The Chicago Tribune''|1949|p=185}} and earning promising reviews.{{sfn|Cassidy|1947|p=13}}  In 1949, she appeared in the role of ''Mougali'' in the premiere performance of the opera ''Ouanga'' by [[Clarence Cameron White]].{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}}{{sfn|Cheatham|2004}} Earning acclaim and a scholarship for her performance, Reese moved to New York City, to continue her voice training with [[Léon Rothier]] and [[Lawrence Benjamin Brown|Lawrence Brown]].{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}}

After her concert debut in 1952, Reese moved to England and studied [[Amanda Aldridge]]. Her European debut was at the [[Gaveau#Salle Gaveau|Salle Gaveau]] in Paris in 1953.{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} Though classically-trained, she gained her reputation from performing [[Spiritual (music)|Spirituals]], [[Gospel music]] and the [[Blues]] with their roots in African-American tradition.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} Touring Europe, she performed both on stage and on the airwaves in Czechoslovakia, England, France, Israel, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and throughout Scandinavia.{{sfn|''The Black Rose''|1964|p=4}} In 1956, she first came in Norway and drew attention for the color of her skin, often billed as a ''negersangerinne'' (black singer). At the time in Norway, the society viewed itself as [[homogeneous]]ly white and had not recognized its indigenous or national minority populations. Reese found similar situations to those she had experienced in the United States, when she was denied lodging numerous times. She persevered, making a name for herself and fell in love.{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1960, she permanently settled in [[Oslo]], Norway and two years later married he bookstore owner Paul Shetelig.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}

Reese began publishing about racial issues in newspapers like the ''[[Dagbladet]]''. In a piece published in 1959, ''Vår hud er sort'' (Our Skin is Black), she addressed the Norwegian indifference to [[Racism|racist policies]] in the United States or South Africa, such as the selling of South African fruits and wines, and began to draw awareness of the problems Africans and black people faced. Public debate on race began for the first time, the University sponsored a series of talks ''Racism and Democracy'', and in 1960, the national trade union proposed a boycott on South African goods. Reese actively took part in the movement to raise awareness, giving a lecture ''De amerikanske negrenes musikkhistorie gjennom 360 år'' (The American Negro's Music History Through 360 Years) throughout the country,{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} in which she explained the difference between Spirituals and Classical music. She felt that to be properly performed, Spirituals could not be sung by white interpreters because "[t]he tones are created in tears. One must feel this pain in the soul to make it sound right".{{sfn|Larsen|2009}} In 1963, to show solidarity with President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights|Civil Rights Agenda]] and the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], Reese collected signatures on a petition and led supporters in a march to the Oslo home of the American ambassador.{{sfn|Kelley|Tuck|2015|p=24}}

In addition to her activism, Reese continued to perform throughout Norway and had wide popularity. She was one of the first black artists to become established in Norway and was a major contributor to the spread of African music in the country. In 1972, a collection of her writings was published in Norwegian, ''Lang svart vei'' (Long Black Road) and in 1979, she released an album ''Motherless Child'' in 1979.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1985, she published her autobiography, ''Min vei'' (My Way), in which she acknowledged that her activism had impacted her career, but was unapologetic for speaking for those who could not "express their despair".{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 1990, she produced the short film ''Pride of Black Dreams'' which presented a brief history of African American through song and dance. It was shown widely in schools and on [[NRK]] Television.{{sfn|Larsen|2009}}{{sfn|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|1990}}

==Death and legacy==
Reese died on 25 October 1990 while giving an address against racism to the organization SOS Rasisme at a gathering being held in Oslo in her honor.{{sfn|''The Anniston Star''|1990|p=8}} Reese's archives were left to her student [[Kristin Asbjørnsen]], who has made recordings in honor of her teacher.{{sfn|Røsjø|2008}} In 2013, Asbjørnsen explained that it had taken her many years to absorb the underlying messages from the lengthy notes and old recordings she had received. Only then was she ready to release albums inspired by Reese's approach.&lt;ref name=kk/&gt;

'''Salutogenesis''' is a term coined by [[Aaron Antonovsky]],&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979&gt;Antonovsky, A. "Health, Stress and Coping" San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of [[medical sociology]].  The term describes an approach focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease ([[pathogenesis]]). More specifically, the "salutogenic model" is concerned with the relationship between [[health]], [[stress (physiology)|stress]], and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]].

Antonovsky's theories reject the "traditional medical-model [[dichotomy]] separating health and illness". He described the relationship as a continuous variable, what he called the "''health-ease'' versus ''dis-ease'' continuum".&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;

==Derivation==
The word "salutogenesis" comes from the Latin ''salus'' = health and the Greek ''genesis'' = origin. Antonovsky developed the term from his studies of "how people manage stress and stay well"&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987&gt;Antonovsky, A. Unraveling The Mystery of Health - How People Manage Stress and Stay Well, San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; (unlike [[pathogenesis]] which studies the causes of diseases). He observed that stress is ubiquitous, but not all individuals have negative health outcomes in response to stress. Instead, some people achieve health despite their exposure to potentially disabling stress factors.

In his 1979 book, ''Health, Stress and Coping'',  Antonovsky described a variety of influences that led him to the question of how people survive, adapt, and overcome in the face of even the most punishing life-stress experiences. In his 1987 book, ''Unraveling the Mysteries of Health'', he focused more specifically on a study of women and aging; he found that 29% of women who had survived [[Nazi concentration camps]] had positive emotional health, compared to 51% of a control group. His insight was that  29% of the survivors were ''not'' emotionally impaired  by the stress. Antonovsky wrote: "this for me was the dramatic experience that consciously set me on the road to formulating what I came to call the 'salutogenic model'."&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt;

In salutogenic theory, people continually battle with the effects of hardship. These ubiquitous forces are called ''generalized resource deficits'' (GRDs). On the other hand, there are ''generalized resistance resources'' (GRRs), which are all of the resources that help a person cope and are effective in avoiding or combating a range of psychosocial stressors. Examples are resources such as money, ego-strength, and social support.

''Generalized resource deficits'' will cause the coping mechanisms to fail whenever the [[Salutogenesis#Sense of coherence|sense of coherence]] is not robust to weather the current situation. This causes illness and possibly even death. However, if the sense of coherence is high, a stressor will not necessarily be harmful. But it is the balance between ''generalized resource deficits'' and ''resources'' that determines whether a factor will be pathogenic, neutral, or salutary.&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonovsky|first=Aaron|title=Unravelling the Mystery of Health|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass Inc.|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonovsky's formulation was that the ''generalized resistance resources'' enabled individuals to make sense of and manage events. He argued that over time, in response to positive experiences provided by successful use of different resources, an individual would develop an attitude that was "in itself the essential tool for coping".&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1979/&gt;

== Sense of coherence ==

The "sense of coherence" is a theoretical formulation that provides a central explanation for the role of stress in human functioning. "Beyond the specific stress factors that one might encounter in life, and beyond your perception and response to those events, what determines whether stress will cause you harm is whether or not the stress violates your sense of coherence."&lt;ref&gt;At everydaypsychology.com: [http://everydaypsychology.com/2007/04/sense-of-coherence.html The Sense of Coherence]&lt;/ref&gt; Antonovsky defined Sense of Coherence as:&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1990&gt;Antonovsky, Aaron. Studying Health vs. Studying Disease,  Lecture at the Congress for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Berlin, 19 February 1990. [http://www.ensp.unl.pt/saboga/soc/pulic/soc_AAconference_berlim_91.pdf available online] from  the Universidade Nova de Lisboa&lt;/ref&gt;

: "a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonovsky|first=Aaron|title=Unravelling the mystery of health|year=1987|publisher=Josey Bass Publishers|isbn=978-1-55542-028-4|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his formulation, the sense of coherence has three components:
* ''Comprehensibility'':  a belief that things happen in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life and reasonably predict what will happen in the future.
* ''Manageability'': a belief that you have the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things,  and that things are manageable and within your control.
* ''Meaningfulness'': a belief that things in life are interesting and a source of satisfaction,  that things are really worthwhile and that there is good reason or purpose to care about what happens.
According to Antonovsky,  the third element is the most important. If a person believes there is no reason to persist and survive and confront challenges, if they have no sense of meaning, then they will have no motivation to comprehend and manage events.  His essential argument is that "salutogenesis" depends on experiencing a strong "sense of coherence".  His research demonstrated that the sense of coherence predicts positive health outcomes.

== Fields of application ==

=== Health and medicine ===
Antonovsky viewed his work as primarily addressed to the fields of [[health psychology]], [[behavioral medicine]], and the sociology of health.&lt;ref name=Antonovsky1987/&gt; The term has been adopted in the [[medical]] fields of [[healthcare]] and [[preventive medicine]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It has also been adopted as a term to describe contemporary approaches to nursing,&lt;ref&gt;England, M., &amp; Artinian, B.

=== Workplace ===
The sense of coherence with its three components meaningfulness, manageability and understandability has also been applied to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor J. Jenny, Georg F. Bauer, Hege Forbech Vinje, Katharina Vogt, Steffen Torp, ''The Application of Salutogenesis to Work''. In: ''The Handbook of Salutogenesis'', 3 September 2016, pp. 197-210. DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-04600-6_20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22184959"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Piotrowicz M, Cianciara D |title=[Salutogenesis--new approach to health and disease] |language=Polish |journal=Przeglad Epidemiologiczny |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=521–7 |year=2011 |pmid=22184959 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Meaningfulness'' is considered to be related to the feeling of participation and motivation and to a perceived meaning of the work.&lt;ref name="lindmark-etal"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=U. Lindmark, P. Wagman, C. Wåhlin, B. Rolander|title=Workplace health in dental care – a salutogenic approach|journal=International Journal of Dental Hygiene|volume=16|issue=1|pages=103–113|doi=10.1111/idh.12257|pmid=27860378|pmc=5811775|date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''meaningfulness'' component has also been linked with [[Job control (workplace)|Job control]] and with task significance. Job control implies that employees have more authority to make decisions concerning their work and the working process. Task significance involves "the experience of congruence between personal [[Value (ethics)|values]] and work activities, which is accompanied by strong feelings of identification with the attitudes, values or goals of the working tasks and feelings of [[motivation]] and involvement".&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p81"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J. Jenny|title=Salutogenic organizations and change: The concepts behind organizational health intervention research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRBAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-6470-5|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''manageability'' component is considered to be linked to job control as well as to access to resources.&lt;ref name="lindmark-etal"/&gt; It has also been considered to be linked with [[social skill]]s and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. [[Social relation]]s relate also to the ''meaningfulness'' component.&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p82"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J. Jenny|title=Salutogenic organizations and change: The concepts behind organizational health intervention research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRBAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-6470-5|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''comprehensibility'' component may be influenced by consistent feedback at work,&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p82"/&gt; for example concerning the [[performance appraisal]].

'''Same-sex intimacy''' refers to a relationship between two friends of the same sex that has many components of a sexually intimate relationship (e.g. self-disclosures, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical contact and trust),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Monsour, "Meanings of Intimacy in Cross- and Same-Sex Friendships", ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' 9, no. 2 (1992): 277.&lt;/ref&gt; but not necessarily sexual intimacy or sexual contact.  The term can apply to the exploration of sexuality outside the home, as well as to the physical activities shared between two friends.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary applications include the "[[bromance]]" culture, referring intimate bonds formed between male friends in films such as ''[[I Love You, Man]]'', as well as the familial bonds exhibited by close female friends, propagated in the mainstream media by television shows such as ''[[Sex and the City]]''.

== History ==

=== Historical context ===
{{See also|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}
In ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'', American [[LGBT]] historian [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] explores notable incidents of same-sex love prior to the creation of the word "[[homosexual]]"—a time that Katz describes as "the universe before that great sexual divide."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, ''x''&lt;/ref&gt;  Katz's research suggests that prior to distinguishing this [[Wikt:binary|binary]] (heterosexual-homosexual), men felt freer to explore feelings of intense intimacy for other men without feeling judged or stigmatized by societal views. Katz writes, "We may refer to early-nineteenth-century men's acts or desires as gay or [[Heterosexuality|straight]], homosexual, [[heterosexual]], or [[bisexual]], but that places their behaviors and lusts within our sexual system, not the system of their time."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  One example that Katz examines in his book is the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his friend [[Joshua Fry Speed]]. In 1837, the two men began rooming together their first night of meeting, sharing Speed's double bed for the sake of logic and convenience, and quickly developed a close relationship. The two maintained an intimate bond until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's death]] in 1865. Although there is no evidence that Lincoln and Speed had a sexual physical relationship, Speed once stated about his relationship with Lincoln that "no men were ever more intimate."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual policing ===

Throughout the 1700s, there was an extensive sexual policing of young people. The restrictions in place included mandatory chaperones when on dates and attending public events, as well as other socially acceptable customs such as [[bundling (tradition)|bundling]]. The latter refers to times when a male courter would spend the night in the same bed as his female companion—which was often both necessary and practical, as many courters lived a fair distance from their love interests and the majority of homes had limited beds. When bundling, both partners remained fully clothed and wrapped in separate blankets, sometimes with a "bundling board" between their bodies, to ensure that no sexual activity would take place.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Many intimate same-sex friendships were developed as a response to such sexual policing practices. Intimate relationships between friends were considered a socially acceptable method of sexual expression outside of marriage, as well an outlet for emotional desire that was otherwise limited at this time.

In ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', [[Michel Foucault]] explores the theory of the [[repressive hypothesis]]: the belief that throughout the 1800s, sex was not spoken about because of the heavy sexual policing taking place throughout the [[Victorian Era]]. Foucault argues that the Repressive Hypothesis was hypocritical and inaccurate, as, in actuality, sex was discussed at great lengths at this time.&lt;ref name=Repressive&gt;Michel Foucault, "The Repressive Hypothesis", ''The History of Sexuality: An Introduction'' (New York: Vintage, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  The restrictions, Foucault argued, were in reference to who was permitted to discuss sex and desire and in what situation.&lt;ref name=Repressive/&gt;  For instance, citizens were encouraged to disclose their sexual desires and fantasies to Catholic priests in the name of repentance. Foucault's research on the repressive hypothesis and similar myths about how sexuality was discussed and perceived in the Victorian Era demonstrates further how sexual practices were policed, regulated, and monitored by those in power.

=== Sodomy ===

In the 1800s, "[[sodomy]]" referred to a number of sexual activities that were perceived as deviant. These acts included anal and oral sex outside of marriage, bestiality, masturbation, the "spending of your seed upon another man," and the corrupting youth to partake in any of these activities.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Officially, these acts were punishable by death, but [[sodomy|sodomites]] were seldom executed for their crimes. This is because these actions were seen as singular acts for which one could repent. Instead, most offenders were whipped publicly, burned with hot irons, or banished from their towns. All of these punishments were determined and carried out by the church.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"/&gt;  None of these activities branded an individual a "sodomite", for example, but rather as an individual who committed an act of sodomy.

=== Courtly love and sonnet writing ===

At its conception, the term "[[courtly love]]" referred to the extensive code created to control the intense feelings of love between a knight and a married woman of a higher social standing.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s.v. "Courtly love," (8th ed., Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The knight in question would perform great acts of bravery in her name in order to demonstrate his love for her from afar. In later years, the definition of "courtly love" expanded to signify any admiration for a peer and, further, the notion that it was an acceptable form of admiration to create writings or art about your beloved.

The most notable example of frequent and common instances of courtly love occurs in the writings of [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare wrote many sonnets to young men that he admired, praising their beauty, intelligence and virility.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/shakespe.htm "Enter Willie Hughes as Juliet: Or, Shakespeare's Sonnets Revisited"] Gay History and Literature Canon, last modified June 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   He addressed sonnets 1-126 to "Fair Youth"—an individual who is commonly interpreted to be male—and later, in Sonnet 20, refers to the boy as the "master-mistress of [his] passion."&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3259/sonnet-20/ "Sonnet 20"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition (1609)&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples of Shakespeare writing of same-sex intimacy and courtly love are within his [[procreation sonnets]]. In these poems, Shakespeare encourages a young man to marry and have children to preserve his beauty, using loving and occasionally romantic language to communicate his message.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3240/sonnet-1/ "Sonnet 1"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition, (1609)&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, it is believed by many scholars that Shakespeare's famous [[Sonnet 18]] ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?") is also about a man, as he dedicated his book of sonnets to an unidentified "Mr. W.H."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Foster, "Master W.H., R.I.P." PMLA 102 (1987): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Same-sex and "free love" communes ===

While sexuality was heavily policed and regulated in the 1600s, there were many individuals who disagreed with government policies and who opted to rebel. The most notable example of such an instance is [[Thomas Morton (colonist)|Thomas Morton]], an English adventurer who wished to live outside of the family-centric, religion-driven settlements being created by the Christian pilgrims. In 1625, Morton founded [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]]: a commune that opposed the beliefs that he so despised.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  His followers practiced interracial, pre- and extra-marital relationships, polygamy, as well as many forms of same-sex intimacy, union, and sexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The acceptance of same-sex contact within this context helped to lay the groundwork for same-sex communes that followed.

In the 1860s, [[Martha McWhirter]], a married woman living in Belton, Texas, established a community for women who wished to live together away from their husbands, either permanently or part-time. McWhirter's commune allowed for married women to experience emotional relationships without the risk of pregnancy, as well as experience "sensual pleasures" such as mineral baths and other soothing exercises amidst the company of other women.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  While not strictly an expression of same-sex intimacy, this community allowed a socially acceptable way for women to explore friendships and their personal erotic desires outside of the confines of heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"/&gt;

== Exploring sexuality outside marriage and the family ==

While same-sex intimate friendships gave the participants a much-needed confidant and companion, the realization of self outside of one's family was also important to the formation of these friendships. Following the period of time in which families lived in one room and children learned about sexuality from their parents,&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  a different outlet was necessary for sexual growth among youth.  Oftentimes, the practice of a same-sex intimate friendship mirrored that of a heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this was considered a socially acceptable method of seeking companionship outside of marriage. As a result, often men and women were encouraged to find companions to spend time with.

=== Academia ===

[[Boarding school]]s and [[women's college]]s encouraged same-sex intimate friendships because of limited access to males and "socializ[ation]…into a world which valued female sensibility and female bonds."&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Within boarding schools girls formed strong bonds with each other in the absence of other outlets for their emotions and impulses.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;  "Smashing" was a term used during the 1860s and 1870s to describe the intensely romantic relationships paralleling heterosexual courtship formed between young women in formal academic settings.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Smashing: Women’s Relationships Before the Fall", [[Nancy Sahli]] writes "…when a Vassar girl takes a shine to another she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes…candies, locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as—''smashed''."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Sahli, "Smashing: Women's Relationships Before the Fall", ''Chrysalis'' 8 (1979): 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having a crush on, or strong feelings for another girl was common, and celebrated within magazines and other works of fiction.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;

It was the first time for many women in college that they were away from their families and in the public sphere and most were socializing or living with other women who had similar interests and aspirations.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no longer a requirement to wed if a woman decided to become an academic and, because of this, women felt free to continue living with their female companions indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Boston marriage]]s", or partnerships in which women lived and worked together, shared a bed, and planned how to spend their money together, became commonplace. Many professional, young women opted for this arrangement in order to remain financially and emotionally independent of male support.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"/&gt;

College also supported intimate same-sex friendships between males for similar reasons (i.e.: ventures out in to the public sphere, distance from families, easier access to entertainment and friends). Fraternities offered an opportunity for men to live together easily and develop bonds with other males while living in close quarters.

=== Related physical intimacy ===

[[Bosom sex]] was often practised between young women. This refers to the act of revealing or fondling of the breasts by a female companion, often while in bed. Bosom sex signified a deep bond and trust between the women performing it. While this practice was not inherently sexual, it is one of the more documented forms of physical intimacy within same sex intimate friendships and today would certainly be categorized as a sexual act.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"&gt;Karen V. Hansen, "'No Kisses Is Like Youres': An Erotic Friendship Between Two African-American Women During the Mid-Nineteenth Century", ''Gender &amp; History'' 7, no. 2. (1995): 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[No Kisses Is Like Youres]]", Professor [[Karen V. Hansen]] discusses the relationship between Rebecca Primus and Addie Brown: two African American women who shared an intimate long-distance friendship in the 1860s that spanned over nine years and took place mostly through correspondence.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"/&gt;  The preserved letters from this time articulate a friendship that was loving and supportive, and, at times, sexually-charged. Addie writes fondly of her memories sharing a bed with Rebecca and of the incidents of "bosom sex" that they experienced together.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Addie also frequently refers to Rebecca as her "beloved", writing, "Yours {{sic|for ever}}, until death parts us."&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often held hands, kissed, or caressed while in private settings with other women. This behaviour was acceptable and often encouraged within society as long as these women made no genital contact, the actions were done in a private setting, and such intimacy was not performed in front of men.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"/&gt;  Therefore, it was not unusual for women to write notes that mirrored the style and content of love letters to each other, even if one or both of the correspondents were married.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Women often made statements in these letters that they had the desire to make love to one another, which expressed a desire to court and not necessarily to touch.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna and [[Emily Dickinson]] both often wrote to married friends expressing their desire to be with their female counterparts, and anxiety to be so far away from each other.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;

Working class girls, who were experiencing a separation from their family and the ability to venture out into the public sphere for the first time, also found other ways to explore and express their sexuality. Along with intimacy in same-sex friendships, women would often attend [[cabarets]] together, or else avail themselves of the readily available entertainments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They may even attend a [[peepshow]] together, bringing their intimacy into the public by viewing other women together in a sexual light.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Young men also often put themselves in hypersexual situations with their intimate same-sex friends, without directly being sexual with them.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;   In ''[[Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America]]'', [[John D'Emilio]] specifically references Fred Ryman and his friend Claude Macy, whom Ryman "can truly say [he] love[s]" who seek out a prostitute together.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  This was common practice among men who experienced intimate same-sex friendships, and is a practice that has carried on in contemporary times with strip clubs and other such activities.

Whether or not there was also sexual intimacy within these relationships is debatable, as homosexuality was still observed as a punishable offense in the United States of America and the intense need to keep sexuality within the private sphere and away from the public sphere was still present.

=== Formation of homosexuality ===

In 1892, American neurologist [[Charles G. Chaddock]] wrote about same-sex desire in a German health textbook, making the first mention of the word "homosexuality". Chaddock defines homosexuality as the "great diminution or complete absence of sexual feeling for the opposite sex with the substitution of sexual feeling and instinct for the same sex." This is the general understanding we have of the word homosexual today, although at that time homosexuality was still seen as "contrary sexual instinct."&lt;ref&gt;"homosexuality, n.", OED Online, (Oxford University Press: 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the term "homosexual" and the understanding that same-sex sexual desire existed changed the meanings of same-sex intimate friendships. While there had always been some physical aspects to same-sex intimate friendships, now such acts were thrown into a negative light. Sodomy and other activities were no longer seen as single, repentable actions, but instead as a lifestyle choice.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet [[Walt Whitman]] identified his feelings of same-sex attraction as "[[adhesive love]]": something falling outside of same-sex intimacy because of its homoerotic undertones.  Whitman first mentions adhesive love in Leaves of Grass, referring to it as an alternative take on "manly love" or the love of men for men.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"&gt;Jonathan Ned Katz, ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2001), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands on this feeling through several of his poems, talking about his "hot wishes" for strange men he meets in the dark.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"/&gt;  Whitman saw manly love as a sexual expression that did not necessarily go against gender binaries, but, rather, challenged the [[capitalistic]] and Christian-centric spirit of the current American democracy.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;  Whitman understood adhesive love as necessary aspect of comradeship and male bonding.  He did not identify as a homosexual, as the word was not largely recognised. However, he wrote extensively about his erotic physical encounters with young men,&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 170&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of his life had begun to question his sexual identity, as a result of some prodding by homosexual writer [[John Addington Symonds]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, homosexuality began to be recognized as something outside of church law and was discussed in the medical community.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexuality became an identifier of a person, the manifestation of their "[[true nature]]".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  Terms such as "[[Third gender|third sex]]", "[[urning]]", "[[tribad]]" and "[[:wikt:Invert#Noun|invert]]" were used interchangeably with "homosexual".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  In response, sodomy between two willing participants of legal age was officially legalized in New York State in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  However, public outrage against homosexuality, the fierce protection of Christian moral standards, and the desire to appear tough on "[[sexual perversion]]" caused all acts of sodomy to be criminalized until well into the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usages ==

Same-sex intimacy has carried over into the contemporary era. Though our view of it has changed, much of what happens within intimate same-sex friendships remains the same.  The two most popular representations of intimate—and often co-dependent—same-sex friendships in modern popular culture are "bromances" among men and the "BFF" culture among women.

=== Bromance ===
{{Main|Bromance}}

Bromance, like the previous forms of same-sex intimacy, allows men to explore their sexuality and experience intimacy outside of a heterosexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Chen, "Caught in a Bad Bromance", ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'' 21, no. 2 (2012): abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bromance culture encourages men to find intimate friends or "[[heterosexual life partners]]"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', directed by Kevin Smith (1999; Santa Monica, CA: Lions Gate Entertainment), DVD&lt;/ref&gt; in order to experience the closeness and benefits of friendship. This is something that men have often been denied within constructions of modern masculinity.

One example of a bromance relationship in contemporary popular culture was portrayed in the film ''[[I Love You, Man]]'' (2009). In this movie, male characters Peter and Sydney meet and quickly develop a fast and close friendship. Peter is thrilled with his new best friend, but is also hyper-aware of the social confines and emotional restrictions of a same-sex male friendship.&lt;ref&gt;''I Love You, Man'', directed by John Hamburg (2009: Universal City, CA: DreamWorks SKG), DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;  He states, "I’m really nervous. There are no rules for male friendships."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Whipp, "'I Love You, Man' and the Rules of Male Friendship", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Los Angeles, CA), March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of bromance relationships are visible in current popular culture. Examples include:

* ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' (Dale and Saul)
* ''[[Knocked Up]]''
* ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]''
* ''[[Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle]]'' (Harold and Kumar)
* ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (Harry and Lloyd)
* ''[[Clerks]]'', etc. (Jay and Silent Bob)
* ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' (Evan and Seth)
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (Frodo and Sam)
* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (SpongeBob and Patrick)

=== "BFF" culture ===
{{Main|Best friends forever}}

BFF ("best friend forever") relationships are similar to bromances, but instead emphasize the close friendships between women. BFF culture is generally more socially acceptable and less stigmatized than close relationships between men, as women have been historically and socially conditioned to seek out and embrace the friendship of other women.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Simon, [http://www.blogher.com/term-bff-best-friend-forever-harmful-girls’-friendships "BFFs &amp; Mean Girls: Why Best Friends Forever Can Be Harmful to Girls"] BlogHer Editors. November 8, 2011. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  BFF culture can also be referred to as "[[womance]]".

One example of a BFF relationship that closely links to historical examples of same-sex intimacy is that of Meredith and Cristina on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Two surgical interns, the women are drawn to each other because of the fact that they are stubborn and determined to succeed in the male dominated platform of surgery.  They become fast friends, and talk to each other about everything.  Their relationship blossoms into one of same-sex intimacy, with them hugging and holding hands when they walk, sharing a bed platonically, and later raising Meredith's daughter together while she is temporarily separated from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Highfill,  [http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/14/greys-anatomy-meredith-cristina/ "'Grey's Anatomy': Why Meredith and Cristina Are the Best Female Friends on TV"] | EW.com. EW.com. May 14, 2014. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like bromance relationships, many different BFF relationships are visible in popular culture. Some examples of these relationships are visible in:

* ''[[Sex and the City]]''
* ''[[The Golden Girls]]''
* [[The Spice Girls]] (pop group)
* ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''
* ''[[Daria]]'' (Daria and Jane)
* ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' (Thelma and Louise)
* ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'' (Laverne and Shirley)
* ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]''
* [[The Suicide Girls]]

In contemporary society, the label "[[intimate partner]]" can now be applied to any individual who is in an emotionally, physically and/or mentally fulfilling relationship, be it same- or opposite-sexed, and does not necessarily apply only to those have physical sex.  Intimate partners are not defined only by sexual contact; the definition is as broad as same-sex intimate friendships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important "What Is Intimacy and Why Is It so Important?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210001937/http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important |date=2015-02-10 }} - Relationships Australia.

'''Self-realization''' is an expression used in Western [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[spirituality]]; and in [[Indian religions]]. In the Western understanding it is the "fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality."&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; In the Indian understanding, self-realization is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberating knowledge]] of the true Self, either as the permanent undying Atman, or as the absence (''sunyata'') of such a permanent Self.

==Western understanding==
Merriam Webster's dictionary defines self-realization as:
{{quote|Fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-realization |title=Self-realization|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Western world "self-realization" has gained great popularity. Influential in this popularity were psycho-analysis, humanistic psychology, the growing acquaintance with Eastern religions, and the growing popularity of Western [[esotericism]].

===Psychoanalysis===
Though [[Sigmund Freud]] was skeptical of religion and esotericism, his theories have had a lasting influence on Western thought and self-understanding. His notion of repressed memories, though based on false assumptions, has become part of mainstream thought.{{sfn|Webster|1996}}

Freud's ideas were further developed by his students and neo-psycho-analysts. [[Carl Jung]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Winnicott]] have been especially important in the Western understanding of the self. But other alternatives have also been developed.

Jung developed the notion of [[individuation]], the lifelong process in which the centre of psychological life shifts from the ego to the self.

Erikson described human development throughout the life-span in his [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|theory of psychosocial development]].

[[Winnicott]] developed the notion of the [[True self and false self|true self]].

Roberto Assagioli developed his approach of [[Psychosynthesis]], an original approach to psychology.

===Western esotericism===
Western [[esotericism]] integrates a broad variety of traditions, some of which view self-realization as the ultimate goal of a human being.{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Indian religions==
===Jainism===
[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Individual conscience and individual consciousness are central in the [[Jain philosophy]]. Self-realisation is one of the major pre-requisites to attain ultimate enlightenment and liberation ([[moksha]]). Self-realisation means peeling away fabricated layers of own personality to understand the true self and hence the true nature of reality. In Jainism, [[karma]] is portrayed as invisible particles of subtle matter that adhere to a living organism or [[Jiva]]. These particles come together to form a film of negativity and darkness around the soul that obscures the true consciousness; making the Jiva lose touch with its original essence as a [[soul]]. These karmic particles tend to attract more such particles which cause the inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul ([[Āsrava]]), leading the organism to fall into the bondage of lust, worldly pleasures, ego, hatred, jealousy, anger, etc. Thus self-realisation paves the way to simply reverse this process and help the seeker to decipher the absolute truth on its own. Jainism firmly rejects the belief of a creator, and one being is solely responsible for his thoughts, actions, and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=self+realisation+Jainism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD8-qum9TcAhWVWysKHZA3CTMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=self%20realisation%20Jainism&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/is-self-realisation-possible-in-present-times-4002.htm|title=Is Self-realisation Possible in Present Times?|author=|date=|website=www.shrimadrajchandramission.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Samyak+darshan+Samyak+gnana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtx9eU3s7ZAhVTObwKHc6sDnQQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Samyak%20darshan%20Samyak%20gnana&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Expert needed|Hinduism
}}
In [[Hinduism]], self-realization (''[[Atman jnana|atma-jnana]]'' or ''atmabodha'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7-meaning-in-english.words?amp=1|title=आत्मबोध|last=|first=|date=|website=dict.hinkhoj.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is knowledge of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|true self]] beyond both delusion and identification with material phenomena. It refers to self-identification and not mere ego identification{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2018}}.

====Shaivism====
In  [[Shaivism]], self-realization is the direct knowing of the Self God [[Parashiva]]. Self-realization ([[nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]], which means "ecstasy without form or seed," or asamprajñata samādhi) is considered the ultimate spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/glossary_c.html|title=Glossary - "Self Realization"|last=Sivaya|first=Subramuniyaswami|last3=|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Self-realization is considered the gateway to [[moksha]], liberation/freedom from rebirth. This state is attained when the [[Kundalini]] force pierces through the [[Sahasrara|Sahasrara chakra]] at the crown of the head. The realization of Self, [[Parashiva]], considered to be each soul's destiny, is attainable through renunciation, sustained meditation and preventing the germination of future [[karma]] (the phrase "frying the seeds of karma" is often used)&lt;ref&gt;Veeraswamy Krishnaraj, ''The Bhagavad-Gita: Translation and Commentary'' pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/ch01_05.html|title=Dancing with Siva|last=Subramuniyaswami|first=Sivaya|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advaita Vedanta====
Ātman is the [[first principle]] in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. (2010), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Cosimo Classics, pp. 86-87. {{ISBN|1-61640-240-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]]. Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}

Since [[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a separate self, as explicated in the teachings of [[anatman]] and [[sunyata]], self-realization is a ''contradictio in terminis'' for Buddhism. Though the [[tathagatagarbha|tathagatagarbha-teachings]] seem to teach the existence of a separate self, they point to the inherent possibility of attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], not to the existence of a separate self. The [[dharmadhatu|dharmadhatu-teachings]] make this even more clear: reality is an undivided whole; awakening is the realization of this whole.

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikh philosophy}}

[[Sikhism]] propounds the philosophy of Self-realization. This is possible by "aatam-cheennea"&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], page 375&lt;/ref&gt; or "Aap Pashaanae", purifying the self from the false ego:&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P.1056&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'Atam-cheene' is self-analysis, which is gained by peeping into one's self in the light of the teachings of ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]''. It is the process of evaluating and analyzing oneself on the touchstone of 'naam simran' which if practised, pierces into the self and washes it from within. The filth of too much of materialism goes, the self gets purified and the mind comes in 'charhdi kala/higher state of mind". This means that the self should be assessed, examined and purified, leading to self-realization and the purification of our mind. Once purified the mind helps in ushering in oneness with the Super Power as the Guru says, "Atam-cheen bhae nirankari" (SGGS:P. 415) which means that one gets attuned to the Formless Lord through self-realization. Indirectly it means that self-realization leads to God-realization.{{sfn|Majhail (Dr.)|2010|p=272}}}}

[[Guru Nanak]] says,
{{quote|Those who realize their self get immersed in the Lord Himself.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 421&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|He who realizes his self, comes to know the essence.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 224&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is commonly a one-page website which describes the product and asks the visitor to sign up to the product or service before the product or service is actually available. The customer is unaware that the product or service does not yet exist but must give some form of payment in order to get access.

Payment may be done via cash, cash equivalent, time/attention, or simply data as in the case of requesting an email address to sign up.

== History ==

The term derives from Eric Ries [[lean startup]] methodology and is based on [[Smoke testing (software)|smoke testing in a software context]]. Instead of testing a software product for early fundamental flaws, a [[business model]] is tested for the most common flaw: lack of customer demand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5646">The '''social multiplier effect''' is a term used in [[economics]], [[economic geography]], [[sociology]], [[public health]] and other academic disciplines to describe certain social [[Externality|externalities]].  It is based on the principle that high levels of one attribute amongst one's peers can have [[spillover effect]]s on an individual.  "This social multiplier can also be thought of as a ratio ∆P/∆I where ∆I is the average response of an individual action to an [http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~delittle/Encyclopedia%20entries/exogenous%20variable.pdf exogenous parameter] (that affects only that person) and ∆P is the (per capita) response of the peer group to a change in the same parameter that affects the entire peer group."&lt;ref&gt;Sheinkman, José. ''Social Interactions.'' Princeton. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. https://www.princeton.edu/~joses/wp/socialinteractions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the ratio of an individual action to an exogenous parameter to the aggregate effect of the same parameter on the individual's peers.

For example, we know that health outcomes strongly correlate with education level.  Given the social multiplier effect, we know that in the aggregate, if a poorly educated individual moves into a highly educated area they will experience some of the positive health effects associated with being more educated.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important however to distinguish between 1) a local-average model or [[Norm (social)|social norms]], whereby certain attributes are adopted based on them being the socially normal behavior, and 2) a local-aggregate model or social multiplier effect whereby "peer effects are captured by the sum of friends' efforts in some activity."&lt;ref&gt;Xiandong Liu et. al. "Social Multiplier versus Social Norms: What Matters Most for Outcomes?" Center For Economic Policy Research: 2013. Retrieved on 25 February 2016. http://www.voxeu.org/article/social-multiplier-versus-social-norms-what-matters-most-outcomes.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former an individual pays a price for deviating from a norm.  In the latter, as an individual gains more peers who have a certain attribute, they will experience greater utility for adopting this attribute as well.  The following are some examples of research on the social multiplier effect.

== Examples ==
Researchers Scott E. Carrell et. al. have shown that one's friends' fitness affects one's own fitness.  They find that "each out-of-shape individual creates two additional out-of-shape individuals through their social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Carrell et. al.

The social multiplier effect is of particular concern to researchers in economic geography. It is well documented that factors like income and education have strong positive correlations with many aspects of health. This is important because the geographic distribution of income and education is becoming increasingly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, since 1980, on average, cities that had high levels of college educated workers are becoming increasingly college educated whereas those who had low levels are becoming increasingly less educated. The same trend applies to income.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Enrico. ''The New Geography of Jobs.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: 2012. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, as the distribution of income and education level becomes more disparate, many low income regions lose out on the social multiplier benefits they once enjoyed.

[[File:Питирим Сорокин.jpg |thumb| Pitirim Aleksandrovich Sorokin]] 
'''''Sociology of Revolution''''' is a book by [[Russian American]] sociologist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. '''Sociology of revolution''' as branch of [[sociology]] was developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan – Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; to a certain extent earlier than Sorokin. Hobbes lived and created in the period of [[English Revolution]]. In the opinion by Hobbes, "the [[war]] of all against all" (''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'') begins in the period of [[revolution]] and of [[Civil war|Civil War]], when all men threaten by each man, when each man has the right to all things by right of strong man, when "[[Man Is Wolf to Man]]" (''[[Homo homini lupus]]'') Sorokin had generalized the data about the new revolutions, unknowns for Hobbes – [[French Revolution]], [[Russian Revolution]] (1917), etc.

==Review==

[[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]] wrote in work  "The Working of Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;The sociology of revolution. By Pitirim A. Sorokin. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. 1925. Reviewed by Wilbur Cortez Abbott Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; that Sorokin has worked, so to speak, in a laboratory of revolution. Sorokin was, indeed, not able to set down his conclusions in Bolshevist Russia; Sorokin was banished from Russia in 1922, Sorokin wrote his book in the more hospitable atmosphere of Czecho-Slovakia". Sorokin was head of the department of sociology in the University of Petrograd, he was one of the leaders of the moderate revolutionary party, he was a member of the All-Russian Peasants' Soviet and of the [[Constituent assembly]] " in 1917-1918. Sorokin had been imprisoned three times, condemned to death and finally exiled by Bolshevist government for that. What is the result of his study of [[Russian revolution]]? Book of Sorokin is, briefly, the most damning indictment of Bolshevist regime. This book is a careful study of revolution in general. It is one of the best descriptions of revolution ever written—that of [[Thucydides]] on [[Corcyra]]—as it is with the events in France of the eighteenth century or Russia in the twentieth. Revolution is reversion of civilized people to savagery.

==History of creation==

The book ''Sociology of revolution'' was conceived by Sorokin in the years of [[Russian Civil War]] in 1917–1922. Sorokin started writing of this book in Prague in 1922. This book was published in the US in 1925.

Sorokin was entitled the privatdozent of Petrograd university in January, 1917 . Sorokin  became the editor of the newspaper of [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]   and the personal secretary of the prime minister [[Alexander Kerensky]] after [[February Revolution]]. Sorokin was arrested by [[Bolsheviks]] as the deputy of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] on January 2, 1918, Sorokin  was compelled to disappear from the authorities after release from bolshevist prison. Then Sorokin had published the open letter in newspaper  in which Sorokin states a failure of tactics of Socialist Revolutionary Party  and Sorokin declares a gap with this party. [[Vladimir Lenin]] focused the attention on this letter in the Lenin's known article "Valuable Recognitions of Pitirim Sorokin".&lt;ref&gt;Владимир Ленин "Ценные признания Питирима Сорокина"&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin stopped being engaged in political activity and Sorokin  resumed own teaching activity. The authorities didn't like its devastating Sorokin's review about  work of [[Nikolai Bukharin]]  "The theory of a [[historical materialism]]". Later the set of the Sorokin's book "Hunger as a factor in Human Affairs" was destroyed. Sorokin  was arrested as the representative of "bourgeois professorate" and  forced out from Russia under the threat of execution in 1922. Sorokin appeared in the US for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Сорокин П. А. Человек. Цивилизация. Общество.. — Политиздат, 1992 pages 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is revolution good or bad?==
[[File:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|thumb|300px|''Bolshevik'' (1920), by [[Boris Kustodiev]]]]
The [[theory]] of revolution was developed in [[Marxism]] too. Lenin's theory about the reasons for revolution, about the [[revolutionary situation]] resembles the Sorokin' theory partly, but theories of [[Lenin]] and Sorokin differ each other in the estimation of the value of this phenomenon as revolution sharply. Lenin considered that revolution is good; revolutions are "the festivals of the oppressed and the exploited".&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution. page 113&lt;/ref&gt; Revolution is only method for such revolutionaries as [[Marx]], [[Engels]] and Lenin to receive the authority without the elections, since the  capitalist dictatorship not allow a communist party to win in democractic elections. Marx named the revolutions as "the locomotives of [[history]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx The Class Struggles in France Chapter 3: Consequences of June 13, 1849&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokin and Hobbes considered that revolution is very bad. Sorokin considered that the revolution is the severe social illness, which can lead to death of [[social organism]] suddenly, that revolution is the worse method of an improvement of the life of masses. The revolutionaries promise to masses "gold mountains" in the words, but masses receive the [[hunger]], the [[epidemics]] and the executions of innocent people in reality. The negligible results of revolution are reached by enormous price.

Sorokin proposes other methods of improvement and reconstruction of the social organization:

* The peaceful [[reforms]], which don't jam the base instincts of man.
* Scientific research must precede to practical experiment.
* It need conduct the experiment on a low social scale at first.
* Reforms must be carried out by lawful and constitutional means

The conclusion: These canons are observed even under the erection of bridges and breeding of cattle. The inhabitant of distant planet, who observed the cataclysms of Russian revolution, could conclude that the cows and bridges are valued more expensively on the Earth than human life.

==The reasons of revolution==

For the comparison it is possible to give Lenin's opinion about the reasons for revolutionary situation:

{{quotation|What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms:

(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the "upper classes", a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for "the lower classes not to want" to live in the old     way; it is also necessary that "the upper classes should be unable" to live in the old way;

(2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual;

(3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in "peace time", but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the "upper classes" themselves into independent historical action.|Lenin &lt;ref&gt;Vladimir  Ilyich  Lenin The Collapse of the Second International. Page 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sorokin named two reasons for the revolution:

* the suppression of base instincts at the majority of population.
* the disorganization of [[authority ]] and [[social control]].

Why does the suppression of base instincts lead to the revolution always? Because it forces  man to search the exit from the desperate condition. The hunger weakens the brakes, which retain by man from the theft, eating of low-quality food from the dustbin, robbery and murder.
The law-abiding citizen becomes thief and bandit because of the hunger, worker becomes beggar, the believer ceases to be fasted and aristocrat goes to the [[Market (place)|market]] to sell the trousers. The complete disappearance of brakes in the behavior of people can lead to the disintegration of the society, when man tears away "the framework" of civilized behavior completely and this man convert into the beast, which it is permitted all (the murder, violence, robbery).

==The kinds of the suppressed instincts as the first reason for the revolution==
[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|Compare the ''[[sans-culotte]]'' on the left to the culotte-wearer on the right. Both wearing iconic Phrygian caps and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s]]
*  '''The hunger''', as the suppression of digestive [[instinct]]. Hunger preceded all revolutions, especially the hunger on the background of aristocratic gluttony on the feasts.
* '''The increase of [[poverty]]''', as the suppression of the impulse of [[property]]. The [[proletariat]] was poor as "church rat" in [[Russia]]. [[History]] piled the proletariat to "the bed from the nails". The revolutionary armies were comprised most frequently from the poor layers, which can not to lose something, but which can acquire all.
* '''The unsuccessful war and [[state terror]]''', as the suppression of the instinct of self-preservation. Unsuccessful wars precede revolutions. War converts soldiers into the being raged crowds of mad men. Specifically, this had occurred with the Russian soldiers in 1917 and with the German soldiers in 1918. Soldiers throw front and attack the [[government]] with the fury. Examples of these revolutions: The [[Commune of Paris]] after the Franco-Prussian War, Jaceria in [[France]] and uprising [[Wat Tyler]] in [[England]] after Centenary war, revolution 1905 in Russia after [[Russo-Japanese War]], [[February revolution]] 1917 in the end of [[World War I]].  Said  words can be attributed and to  despotic [[regime]]s, such regimes are "pregnant" by revolution  because of  [[state terrorism]] constantly.
*  '''The [[censorship]] and the prohibition to the [[human migration]]''', as the suppression of the impulse  to have of [[freedom of press]] and [[freedom of movement]].
*  '''The  limitations of [[estates of the realm]]''', as the suppression of the instinct of self-expression. The  limitations of estates of the realm prevented by people from the bottoms from engaging of high [[socioeconomic status]], which corresponds to their talents; therefore the innate ruler, who became simple workers, will become by the leader of secret organization, "[[Cicero]]" will become by propagandists.

These are the authentic reasons for revolution, and excuse can be completely different (the quarrel around the religious dogmas or convocation of General States). [[Ideology]] determines the selection of the slogans ("holy earth", "true faith", "republic" or "[[socialism]]"). Ideology determines the selection of popular heroes—[[Jesus Christ]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] or [[Karl Liebknecht]].  Ideology determines the selection of basic idea (interpretation of [[gospel]], national idea, the theory of [[surplus value]] or capitalist [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]). Ideology determines the selection of emblem ("red [[Phrygian cap]]" is the identification mark of French revolutionary—Jacobins, "black shirt" is form of the Italian fascists of Benito Mussolini, "pentagonal red star" is sign of membership in the Red Army).
What social groups do become revolutionary at first of all and why?
Those estates and social groups will be most revolutionary, which have the largest quantity of jammed instincts and, on the contrary, this estates and social groups will be enemies of revolution, which have not jammed instincts completely or which have a small quantity of jammed instincts. Therefore, Bolsheviks could keep on soldiers and workers by the revolutionary ideas easy, and aristocrats were against the revolution always. There were 95% of population on the side of the revolution in February 1917 in Russia, and then some social groups started opposing revolution escalation, these groups wanted that the government brought an order. Even peasants and sailors had risen against the [[Bolsheviks]] in [[Kronstadt]] In 1921. Soviet government had held the authority under these conditions only cause of the terrible fatigue from the cataclysms of Civil War and cause of  concessions in the form of the [[New Economic Policy]].

==The disorganization of authority  and social control as the second reason for revolution==

The disorganization of authority and social control means the incapacity of government to crush the rebellion, to remove the conditions, which cause the dissatisfaction of population, to cleave the mass on the part and to set them against each other by the principle "[[divide and rule]]", to direct the way out of energy for masses into another no-revolutionary "river's bed" according to the principle "to open the valve so that the boiler would not explode". The atmosphere of pre-revolutionary epochs amazes by observer with weakness of the authorities and with degeneration of the elite always. Chronicler Ipuwer wrote about the weakness of authority of [[pharaoh]]s on the eve of the Egyptian revolution of the epoch of average kingdom: "There is no ruler in the country. But where is ruler? Had ruler fallen asleep? Ruler had lost the force and ruler is not support to us". The same situation was in Russia in 1917. There was not one sane and imperious minister, ecrepit [[Ivan Goremykin]], incompetent [[Boris Stürmer]], mad [[Alexander Protopopov]] and mad  Vasily Virubov is the entire gallery of mediocre rulers and cynical dwarfs, this is the result of the complete degeneration of elite.  History "suffers" cruel and injurious governments until they are able to operate the state, but history will carry severe verdict  to powerless and parasitic governments. The degeneration of [[elite]] becomes inevitable, when elite converts into the [[caste]], when social "lifts" are switched off and way is closed for the innate rulers to upward with help of artificial barriers on the way of circulation into the members of elite. Talented premier-minister [[Sergei Witte]] was undergone dislike in side of [[Nicholas II of Russia]] repeatedly. When revolutionary explosion occurs, then pitiless revolutionary broom clears out entire social rubbish (aristocrats—degenerates). "Upstarts" from the bottoms rush to upward on the social ladder through the enormous slot in the social sieve of selection. This sieve exists on each floor of social ladder during the normal period of existence of society, when there is no revolution in society. Therefore, new elite builds the new "sieve" at the second stage of revolution, under protection of which the upstarts, who reached the social top, merge with the remainders of the old aristocracy, which are left for  transfer of experience of control over people. New Bolshevik "sieve" passed to upward only those, who were "from the machine tool" or "from the wooden plough", and new Bolshevik "sieve" rejected to downward all rest people.

==The second stage of revolution==

Revolution has two stages. There is a mad energy output at the first stage of revolution, but the person is not the Perpetuum mobile therefore  mass apathy and fatigue comes sooner or later. The vigorous group or the tyrant can seize power at the second stage of revolution easily, using this weakness and they can  restore an old [[regime]]. The second stage is a stage of "reaction" or "restraint".  Reasons generating this stage, are  strengthening of hunger, [[crime]], [[requisition]]s, [[epidemics]], "[[Bellum omnium contra omnes|wars of all against all]]". People face a dilemma: or to be lost, continuing revolutionary uproar, or to bring an order at any cost. Examples "creators of an order"  are  [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], [[John Zizka]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Augustus]], [[Napoleon]], who are able to bring an order "an iron fist"  after the period of revolutions or reforms.  Society which isn't capable to develop with help of peace reforms, is compelled to pay a tribute for revolution at a rate of considerable part of the population. It is possible to draw a conclusion that peace reform is much better, than a social revolution.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequence''' is a [[sequence]] that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a subsequence of &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; obtained after removal of elements &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a [[preorder]].

The subsequence should not be confused with [[substring]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; which can be derived from the above [[string (computer science)|string]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; by deleting substring &lt;math&gt; \langle E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The substring is a refinement of the subsequence. 

The list of all subsequences for the word "'''apple'''" would be "'''a, ap, al, ae, app, apl, ape, ale, appl, appe, aple, apple, p, pp, pl, pe, ppl, ppe, ple, pple, l, le, e'''". 

== Common subsequence ==

Given two sequences ''X'' and ''Y'', a sequence ''Z'' is said to be a ''common subsequence'' of ''X'' and ''Y'', if ''Z'' is a subsequence of both ''X'' and ''Y''.  For example, if

:&lt;math&gt; X = \langle A,C,B,D,E,G,C,E,D,B,G \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; Y = \langle B,E,G,C,F,E,U,B,K \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

then a common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' could be

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \langle B,E,E \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

This would ''not'' be the ''[[Longest-common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]]'', since ''Z'' only has length 3, and the common subsequence &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt; has length&amp;nbsp;4. The longest common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' is &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,G,C,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
Subsequences have applications to [[computer science]],&lt;ref name="substrVsSubseq"&gt;In computer science, ''[[string (computer science)|string]]'' is often used as a synonym for ''sequence'', but it is important to note that ''[[substring]]'' and ''subsequence'' are not synonyms. Substrings are ''consecutive'' parts of a string, while subsequences need not be. This means that a substring of a string is always a subsequence of the string, but a subsequence of a string is not always a substring of the string, see: {{cite book | last = Gusfield | first = Dan | origyear = 1997 | year = 1999 | title = Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = USA | isbn = 0-521-58519-8 | pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the discipline of [[bioinformatics]], where computers are used to compare, analyze, and store [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]] sequences.

Take two sequences of DNA containing 37 elements, say:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTATGCTGATGCTGACTTATATGCTA&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = CGTTCGGCTATCGTACGTTCTATTCTATGATTTCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

The longest common subsequence of sequences 1 and 2 is:

:&lt;tt&gt;LCS&lt;sub&gt;(SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = '''CGTTCGGCTATGCTTCTACTTATTCTA'''&lt;/tt&gt;

This can be illustrated by highlighting the 27 elements of the longest common subsequence into the initial sequences:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A'''{{font color|red|CG}}'''G'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TCG}}'''T'''{{font color|red|GCTATGCT}}'''GA'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ACTTAT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''{{font color|red|CGTTCGGCTAT}}'''C'''{{font color|red|G}}'''TA'''{{font color|red|C}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TTCTA}}'''TT'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ATT}}'''T'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''A&lt;/tt&gt;

Another way to show this is to ''align'' the two sequences, ''i.e.'', to position elements of the longest common subsequence in a same column (indicated by the vertical bar) and to introduce a special character (here, a dash) in one sequence when two elements in the same column differ:
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTAT-G--C-TGATGCTGA--CT-T-ATATG-CTA-&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|||&amp;nbsp;|||||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||| &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -C-GT-TCG-GCTATCGTACGT--T-CT-ATTCTATGAT-T-TCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

Subsequences are used to determine how similar the two strands of DNA are, using the DNA bases: [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]].

== Theorems ==
* Every infinite sequence of real numbers has an infinite [[monotone sequence|monotone]] subsequence (This is a lemma used in the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem#Proof|proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* Every infinite [[bounded sequence]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; has a convergent subsequence (This is the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* For all integers ''r'' and ''s'', every finite sequence of length at least (''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''r'' ''or'' a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''s'' (This is the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]]).

'''The Candle is Lighted, We Can Not Blow it Out''' refers to a series of engravings featuring a set of Protestant reformers seated around a candle on a table. The central figure is [[Martin Luther]], surrounded by both contemporary and historical Protestant reformers. Opposite him is a group of Catholics trying to blow the candle out. Often the first part of the text is pointing towards the bible, on which the light of the candle is shining, and the second part of the text is somewhat hidden under the puffs of breath coming from the Catholic objectors. Sometimes the candle is labelled "Evangelarium" or ''Gospels''.

Little is known of the origins of the text, but many assume the popularity of the scene in English means it was a 17th-century English invention. Luther with his bible translations and the other reformers through their questions regarding [[papal bull]]s and so forth have shed light on the bible, but they must protect it from the Catholics (the bull represents the papal bulls) who would wish to plunge it into darkness. Sometimes the text has the footnote ''[[Matthew 6]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Above the heads of the men around the table are the heads of six "protesting" theologians, heroes of the Reformation movement: [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Georgius Princeps Anhaldinus]], died 1553, [[Johannes Alasco]], died 1509, [[William Farel]], died 1565, [[Johannes Sleidanus]], died 1556, [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde|Philip Mauxius]], died 1595 in St Aldegonde, and [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]], died 1602.

In this engraving-painting pair the same scene is depicted, but the "historical theologians" are in circular portraits and in the painting, the Dutch text has been overpainted. Both the engraving and the painting were created in the 17th-century.

'''Theatrix''' is a [[role playing game]] produced by the defunct Backstage Press and no longer in print. Primarily [[Diceless role-playing game|diceless]], the game includes rules for using dice to resolve actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Theatrix Summary| accessdate = 2007-10-21| url = http://www.amadan.org/Theatrix/Theatrix-summary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game applies cinematic concepts to role-playing—the players are "actors" and the [[game master|GM]] is the "director." The games attempts to frame adventures in the model of screenplays, which have a structured plot consisting of a number of agreed upon acts, scenes, and "pinch-points".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = RPGnet : The Inside Scoop on Gaming| accessdate = 2007-10-21| url = http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Raven's Mutterings| accessdate = 2007-10-21| url = http://raven.phoenyx.net/mutterings/2004/11/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823031402/http://raven.phoenyx.net/mutterings/2004/11/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players use plot points to guarantee success of an action or take minor control of the story. This was a relatively new and controversial concept being championed by few in mainstream RPGs at the time of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Essay: The Origin of the Threefold Model| accessdate = 2007-10-21| url = ttp://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/threefold/origin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = rec.games.frp.advocacy info| accessdate = 2007-10-21| url = http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/rgfa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their numerically-rated attributes and skills, characters possess non-numerically-rated personality traits, and unrated 'descriptors'. Descriptors can act as advantages, but in order to use them so, the player must spend plot points. They can also act as disadvantages, and when they do so, the player gains plot points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Theatrix Summary| accessdate = 2013-04-16
| url = http://www.amadan.org/Theatrix/Theatrix-summary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game encourages [[collaborative roleplaying]], using what it calls "Distributed Directing", whereby the players may introduce subplots though the GM remains responsible for directing the main plot. Theatrix has many methods of resolving action and conflict without dice. Most notable is the use of extensive flow-charts, printed on card-stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The RPG Times - A creative look at roleplaying

[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr c1879.jpg|thumb|right|In the 19th century, there was a lack of confidence in the remedies of the day.  [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] said, "...if the whole ''[[materia medica]]'', as now used, could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be so much the better for mankind – and all the worse for the fishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/29/therapeutic-nihilism-0 |title=Therapeutic nihilism |journal=British Medical Journal |author=Peter Morrell |volume=326 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7388.518/c |date=1 March 2003 |page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Therapeutic nihilism''' is a contention that it is impossible to cure people or societies of their ills through treatment.

In medicine, it was connected to the idea that many "cures" do more harm than good, and that one should instead encourage the body to heal itself. [[Michel de Montaigne]] espoused this view in his ''[[Essais]]'' in 1580. This position was later popular, among other places, in France in the 1820s and 1830s, but has mostly faded away in the modern era due to the development of provably effective medicines such as [[antibiotics]]. However, a contemporary version of therapeutic nihilism is defended by Jacob Stegenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Medical Nihilism |author=Jacob Stegenga |publisher=OUP |year=2018 |isbn= 9780198747048 | url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/medical-nihilism-9780198747048?cc=hr&amp;lang=en&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around the late 19th century, therapeutic nihilism gained some prominence among medical professionals. Proponents of this view claimed that every man should be his own physician through democratization of knowledge. Cultural critic [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote that “the stream of tendency of modern medical thought was toward a therapeutic nihilism.”

The most preferred treatment method at the time was active medication. Active medication represented, to some degree, the cutting-edge of existing medical thought, which also led to assumptions and inaccuracies. For example, when cocaine was first discovered, it was described in all of medical literature to have curative properties towards diseases such as gastralgia, childbirth, and nasal hemorrhage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} This was in contrast to routine therapy, where the patient took the same medication consistently. Culturally, doctors were considered heroic figures when active medication worked while unsuccessful cases could be labeled as unfortunate and dismissed. [[Robert Bartholow]], a contemporary physician, said “the science of therapeutics should be made more certain” and that the “true knowledge of drug knowledge is not widely enough diffused.” In other words, the medical treatments of the 19th century have gained theoretical acceptance but were lacking in practicality. When faced with everyday exigencies, many physicians were left clueless. In addition, the ratio of medical practitioners to the US population in 1888 was 1 per 580 persons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The medical community officially recognized these concerns in 1888 when the president of the [[American Medical Association]] stated that there were “odious defects in the American medical education system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CLARKE|first1=MAURICE D.|title=Therapeutic Nihilism|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|date=30 August 1888|volume=119|issue=9|pages=199–201|doi=10.1056/NEJM188808301190903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic nihilism slowly faded in the 19th century as systematic reform of the medical education system took place, then reappeared in the 20th century in a slightly different fashion than prior. The aggressive empiricism of the 19th century enlightened the medical society of the need to thoroughly evaluate every aspect of clinical practice. Prior to the publication of rigorous research later in the 20th century, some physicians believed the most potent weapon for treatment was not medication, but the regulation of bodily secretions such as extraction of blood, promotion of perspiration, or urination to regain the natural state of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Charles|title=,THE THERAPEUTIC|journal=webcache.googleusercontent.com|date=1979|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:S9WhkkxRx8IJ:https://web.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/154/fixes/TherapeuticRevolution%2520Rosenberg.pdf+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Illich]] was one of the ardent supporters of therapeutic nihilism. In his book ''Medical Nemesis'', Illich claimed that the great increase in life expectancy and public health experienced in his era was due to improved nutrition and sanitation, rather than innovation in drugs and medicines. He also believed there was an excess of physicians, surgeries and prescriptions. Therapeutic nihilists claimed such excess often led to malpractice and increase in [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] (doctor-caused) injuries, accusing the physicians of creating even more illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starr|first1=Paul|title=The Politics of Therapeutic Nihilism|journal=The Hastings Center Report|date=October 1976|volume=6|issue=5|pages=24|doi=10.2307/3561255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic nihilism mostly faded by the mid-20th century, and some researchers have concluded that “therapeutic nihilism was replaced by an armamentarium of therapeutic inventions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerebrovascular Disease: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional: 2011 Edition: ScholarlyPaper|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|isbn=9781464911965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMTNobHjyRgC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=Cerebrovascular+Disease:+New+Insights+for+the+Healthcare+Professional,+ISBN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-LOz5Zh10R&amp;sig=hfPmURVwxArVcFHyCtPJRsvVnN0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV_63rxLrSAhXnv1QKHSiAAhUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cerebrovascular%20Disease%3A%20New%20Insights%20for%20the%20Healthcare%20Professional%2C%20ISBN&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase ''therapeutic nihilism'' is included in a modern version of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], traditionally taken by physicians upon graduation, "... I will apply for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of over-treatment and therapeutic nihilism."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=55 |title=Hippocrates Cried |author=Michael Taylor |publisher=OUP USA |year=2013 |isbn=9780199948062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''truth-value links''' is a concept in [[metaphysics]] discussed in debates between [[philosophical realism]] and [[anti-realism]]. Philosophers who appeal to truth-value links in order to explain how individuals can come to understand parts of the world that are apparently cognitively inaccessible (the past, the feelings of others, etc.) are called truth-value link realists.

== Truth-value link realism&lt;!--'Truth-value link realism' and 'Evidence-transcendent' redirects here--&gt; ==

[[Image:TVL.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|The principle of ''truth-value links'' depicted graphically.]]

Proponents of '''truth-value link realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; argue that our understanding of past-tense statements allows us to grasp the truth-conditions of the statements, even if they are '''evidence-transcendent'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. They explain this by noting that it is unproblematic for us to conceptualize a present-tense true statement being true in the future. In other words, if "It is raining today" is true today, then "It was raining yesterday" will be true tomorrow. Truth-value link realists argue that this same construction can be applied to past-tense statements. For example, "It was raining yesterday" is true today if and only if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday.

The truth-value link allows us to understand the following. First, suppose that we can understand, in an unproblematic way, truth about a present-tense statement. Assume that it is true, now, when one claims "On 22 May 2006, Student X is writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement A. Suppose that, a year later, someone claims, "On 22 May 2006, Student X was writing a paper for her philosophy seminar," and call it statement B. According to [[Michael Dummett]]’s explication of the truth-value link, "since the statement A is now true, the statement B, made in one year’s time, is likewise true."&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael, "The Reality of the Past," in ''Truth and Other Enigmas'' (Harvard University Press, 1978), 363.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in understanding the truth-value link that one is able to understand what it is for a statement in the past-tense to be true. The truth-value persists in the tense shift – hence the "link."

=== Criticisms ===

Some philosophers, including [[Michael Dummett]] and [[John McDowell]], have criticized truth-value link realism. They argue that it is unintelligible to suppose that training in a language can give someone ''more'' than what is involved in the training, i.e. access to inaccessible realms like the past and the minds of others. More important, they suggest that the realist appeal to the principle of truth-value links does not actually explain how the inaccessible can be cognized. When the truth-value link realist claims that, if "It is raining today" ''was'' true yesterday, then "It was raining yesterday" ''is'' true today, he or she is still appealing to an inaccessible realm of the past. In brief, one is attempting to access that which one has already conceded as being inaccessible.

In Book 12 ({{lang-grc-gre|Λ}}) of his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle describes the unmoved mover as being perfectly beautiful, indivisible, and contemplating only the perfect [[contemplation]]: itself contemplating. He equates this concept also with the [[active intellect]]. This Aristotelian concept had its roots in [[cosmology|cosmological]] speculations of the earliest Greek [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s and became highly influential and widely drawn upon in [[medieval philosophy]] and [[theology]]. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], for example, elaborated on the unmoved mover in the {{lang|la|[[Quinque viae]]}}.

== First philosophy ==
Aristotle argues, in Book 8 of the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and Book 12 of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', "that there must be an immortal, unchanging being, ultimately responsible for all wholeness and orderliness in the sensible world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Sachs |title=Aristotle: Metaphysics|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-met/#H9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Physics'' (VIII 4–6) Aristotle finds "surprising difficulties" explaining even commonplace change, and in support of his approach of explanation by [[four causes]], he required "a fair bit of technical machinery".&lt;ref name="Shields2007-187"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-28331-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;pg=PA187 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "machinery" includes [[potentiality and actuality]], [[hylomorphism]], the theory of categories, and "an audacious and intriguing argument, that the bare existence of change requires the postulation of a '''first cause''', an unmoved mover whose necessary existence underpins the ceaseless activity of the world of motion".&lt;ref name="Shields2007-196-226"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;pg=PA196 |pages=196, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's "first philosophy", or [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] ("''after'' the [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]"), develops his peculiar theology of the prime mover, as {{lang|grc|πρῶτον κινοῦν ἀκίνητον}}: an independent divine eternal unchanging immaterial substance.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-109"/&gt;

Aristotle adopted the geometrical model of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], to provide a general explanation of the apparent wandering of the [[classical planets]] arising from uniform circular motions of [[celestial spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last=Mendell |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Eudoxus/Astronomy/EudoxusHomocentricSpheres.htm |title=Eudoxus of Cnidus: Astronomy and Homocentric Spheres |series=Vignettes of Ancient Mathematics |date=16 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516145329/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Eudoxus/Astronomy/EudoxusHomocentricSpheres.htm |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of spheres in the model itself was subject to change (47 or 55), Aristotle's account of [[aether (classical element)|aether]], and of [[potentiality and actuality]], required an individual unmoved mover for each sphere.&lt;ref name="sep-aristotle-natphil"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bodnar |first=Istvan |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-natphil/notes.html#31 |title=Aristotle's Natural Philosophy|editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Spring 2010 |year=2010 |quote=In Metaphysics 12.8, Aristotle opts for both the uniqueness and the plurality of the unmoved celestial movers. Each celestial sphere possesses the unmoved mover of its own—presumably as the object of its striving, see Metaphysics 12.6—whereas the mover of the outermost celestial sphere, which carries with its diurnal rotation the fixed stars, being the first of the series of unmoved movers also guarantees the unity and uniqueness of the universe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final cause and efficient cause===
{{quotation|Simplicius argues that the first unmoved mover is a cause not only in the sense of being a final cause—which everyone in his day, as in ours, would accept—but also in the sense of being an efficient cause (1360. 24ff.), and his master Ammonius wrote a whole book defending the thesis (ibid. 1363. 8–10). Simplicius's arguments include citations of Plato's views in the ''Timaeus''—evidence not relevant to the debate unless one happens to believe in the essential harmony of Plato and Aristotle—and inferences from approving remarks which Aristotle makes about the role of ''Nous'' in Anaxagoras, which require a good deal of reading between the lines. But he does point out rightly that the unmoved mover fits the definition of an efficient cause—"whence the first source of change or rest" (''Phys''. II. 3, 194b29–30; Simpl. 1361. 12ff.). The examples which Aristotle adduces do not obviously suggest an application to the first unmoved mover, and it is at least possible that Aristotle originated his fourfold distinction without reference to such an entity. But the real question is whether, given his definition of the efficient cause, it includes the unmoved mover willy-nilly. One curious fact remains: that Aristotle never acknowledges the alleged fact that the unmoved mover is an efficient cause (a problem of which Simplicius is well aware: 1363. 12–14)...&lt;ref name="Graham1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

===Aristotle's theology===
The unmoved movers, if they were anywhere, were said to fill the outer void, beyond the sphere of fixed stars:
{{quotation|It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified, living the best and most self sufficient of lives… From [the fulfilment of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.1.i.html#802 |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |title=''De Caelo'' |trans-title=On the Heavens |volume=I |author=Aristotle (J. L. Stocks trans.) |date=7 January 2009 |at=I.9, 279 a17–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''De Caelo''|I.9, 279 a17–30}}
 
The unmoved movers are, themselves, immaterial substance, (separate and individual beings), having neither parts nor magnitude. As such, it would be physically impossible for them to move material objects of any size by pushing, pulling or collision. Because matter is, for Aristotle, a substratum in which a potential to change can be actualized, any and all potentiality must be actualized in a being that is eternal but it must not be still, because continuous activity is essential for all forms of life. This immaterial form of activity must be intellectual in nature and it cannot be contingent upon sensory perception if it is to remain uniform; therefore eternal substance must think only of thinking itself and exist outside the starry sphere, where even the notion of place is undefined for Aristotle. Their influence on lesser beings is purely the result of an "aspiration or desire",&lt;ref&gt;"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p. 233ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and each aetheric celestial sphere emulates one of the unmoved movers, as best it can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The first heaven, the outmost sphere of fixed stars, is moved by a desire to emulate the prime mover (first cause),&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII 6, 258 b26-259 a9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Now understood as the [[Earth's rotation]].&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to whom, the subordinate movers suffer an accidental dependency.

Many of Aristotle's contemporaries complained that oblivious, powerless gods are unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-109"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first1=Sir David |last1=Ross |first2=John Lloyd |last2=Ackrill |edition=6th ed., revised |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32857-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;pg=PA190 |pages=188, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it was a life which Aristotle enthusiastically endorsed as one most enviable and perfect, the unembellished basis of theology. As the whole of nature depends on the inspiration of the eternal unmoved movers, Aristotle was concerned to establish the metaphysical necessity of the perpetual motions of the heavens. It is through the seasonal action of the Sun upon the terrestrial spheres, that the cycles of generation and corruption give rise to all ''natural'' motion as efficient cause.&lt;ref name="Shields2007-121"/&gt; The intellect, ''[[nous]]'', "or whatever else it be that is thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine" is the highest activity, according to Aristotle (contemplation or speculative thinking, ''theōrētikē''). It is also the most sustainable, pleasant, self-sufficient activity;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1177a.20 Nicomachean Ethics]'' X 1177 a20&lt;/ref&gt; something which is aimed at for its own sake. (In contrast to politics and warfare, it does not involve doing things we'd rather not do, but rather something we do at our leisure.) This aim is not strictly human, to achieve it means to live in accordance not with mortal thoughts, but something immortal and divine which is within humans. According to Aristotle, contemplation is the only type of happy activity which it would not be ridiculous to imagine the gods having. In Aristotle's psychology and biology, the intellect is the [[soul]], (see also ''[[eudaimonia]]'').

===First cause===
In book VIII of his ''Physics,''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle examines the notions of change or motion, and attempts to show by a challenging argument, that the mere supposition of a 'before' and an 'after', requires a ''first principle''. He argues that in the beginning, if the cosmos had come to be, its first motion would lack an antecedent state, and as [[Parmenides]] said, "[[nothing comes from nothing]]". The [[cosmological argument]], later attributed to Aristotle, thereby draws the conclusion that God exists. However, if the cosmos had a beginning, Aristotle argued, it would require an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause, a notion that Aristotle took to demonstrate a critical flaw.&lt;ref name="Brentano1978"&gt;{{cite book |first=F.C. |last=Brentano |first2=R. |last2=George |first3=R.M. |last3=Chisholm |year=1978 |title=Aristotle and His World View |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520033900 |lccn=lc76050245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frwLUNC_3soC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Caelo'' Book I Chapter 10 280a6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' Book VIII 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;But it is a wrong assumption to suppose universally that we have an adequate first principle in virtue of the fact that something always is so … Thus [[Democritus]] reduces the causes that explain nature to the fact that things happened in the past in the same way as they happen now: but he does not think fit to seek for a first principle to explain this 'always' … Let this conclude what we have to say in support of our contention that there never was a time when there was not motion, and never will be a time when there will not be motion. (''Physics'' VIII, 2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |author2=(trans. Hardie, R. P. &amp; Gaye, R. K.) |date=7 January 2009 |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.8.viii.html#172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of Aristotle's [[cosmological argument]], that at least one eternal unmoved mover must exist, is to support everyday change.&lt;ref name="Shields2007-222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-28331-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;pg=PA222 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of things that exist, substances are the first. But if substances can, then all things can perish... and yet, time and change cannot. Now, the only continuous change is that of place, and the only continuous change of place is circular motion. Therefore, there must be an eternal circular motion and this confirmed by the fixed stars which are moved by the eternal actual substance substance that's purely actual.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-186"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first1=Sir David |last1=Ross |first2=John Lloyd |last2=Ackrill |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Aristotle's estimation, an explanation without the temporal [[actuality and potentiality]] of an infinite locomotive chain is required for an eternal cosmos with neither beginning nor end: an unmoved eternal substance for whom the [[Primum Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;The outermost celestial sphere, for Aristotle, the [[sphere of fixed stars]].&lt;/ref&gt; turns diurnally and whereby all terrestrial cycles are driven: day and night, the seasons of the year, the transformation of the elements, and the nature of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="sep-aristotle-natphil" /&gt;

== Substance and change ==

Aristotle begins by describing substance, of which he says there are three types: the sensible, which is subdivided into the perishable, which belongs to physics, and the eternal, which belongs to "another science". He notes that sensible substance is changeable and that there are several types of change, including quality and quantity, generation and destruction, increase and diminution, alteration, and motion. Change occurs when one given state becomes something contrary to it: that is to say, what exists potentially comes to exist actually. (See [[Potentiality and actuality]].) Therefore, "a thing [can come to be], incidentally, out of that which is not, [and] also all things come to be out of that which is, but is [[potential]]ly, and is not actually." That by which something is changed is the mover, that which is changed is the matter, and that into which it is changed is the form.

Substance is necessarily composed of different elements. The proof for this is that there are things which are different from each other and that all things are composed of elements. Since elements combine to form composite substances, and because these substances differ from each other, there must be different elements: in other words, "b or a cannot be the same as ba".

== Number of movers ==

Near the end of ''Metaphysics'', Book {{lang|grc|Λ}}, Aristotle introduces a surprising question, asking "whether we have to suppose one such [mover] or more than one, and if the latter, how many".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' 1073a14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle concludes that the number of all the movers equals the number of separate movements, and we can determine these by considering the mathematical science most akin to philosophy, i.e., astronomy.  Although the mathematicians differ on the number of movements, Aristotle considers that the number of [[celestial spheres]] would be 47 or 55.  Nonetheless, he concludes his ''Metaphysics'', Book {{lang|grc|Λ}}, with a quotation from the ''[[Iliad]]'': "The rule of many is not good; one ruler let there be."&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad,'' ii, 204; quoted in Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' 1076a5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry A. Wolfson, "The Plurality of Immovable Movers in Aristotle and Averroës," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', 63 (1958): 233–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Women of the World is a week-long festival held in various places around the world. It features musical performances, debates, public speeches, mentoring sessions, and more. Women of the World festival is usually referred to as WOW.

The first WOW Festival was held in the United Kingdom, but now takes place in many other locations throughout the world. The festivals are rooted in local areas, but are connected internationally. The festivals feed into each other, sharing stories and inspiring one another. All of the festivals are intertwined but each is unique in its own way. They all  share the same WOW name. To date the Women of the World Festival has been held across three different continents. By 2018, WOW will take place in 53 countries.
