'''L'Abbaye de Créteil''' or '''Abbaye group''' ({{lang-fr|Groupe de l'Abbaye}}) was a [[utopian]] artistic and literary community founded during the month of October, 1906. It was named after the [[Créteil]] [[Abbey]], as most gatherings took place in that suburb of Paris.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins2"&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3678759W/Albert_Gleizes_1881-1953 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
L'Abbaye de Créteil group was a ''[[phalanstère]]'', a utopian community, founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter [[Albert Gleizes]], and the poets {{Interlanguage link multi|René Arcos|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri-Martin Barzun|fr}}, [[Alexandre Mercereau]] and [[Charles Vildrac]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lredudrameessa00barz#page/134/mode/2up Barzun, Henri-Martin, ''L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synthèse Poétique Moderne'', Figuière, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement drew its inspiration from the ''Abbaye de Thélème,'' a fictional creation by [[Rabelais]] in his novel ''[[Gargantua]]''. It was closed down by its members early in 1908.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

[[Georges Duhamel]] and Vildrac settled in [[Créteil]], just to the southeast of [[Paris]], in a house in a park-like setting along the [[Marne River]]. Their aim was to establish a place of freedom and friendship favourable for artistic and literary creativity.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

Henri-Martin Barzun (father of the historian and cultural critic [[Jacques Barzun]]) was a financial contributor to his friends at the ''Abbaye de Créteil''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an unpublished part of his Souvenirs Gleizes wrote that an initial idea for the Abbaye of Créteil was to escape from corrupt Western civilization to the simplicity of life in the South Seas, as he then believed Gauguin had done. (Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group tried to create a publishing house that would bring in sufficient income to support the ''Abbaye''. The typographer {{Interlanguage link multi|Lucien Linard|fr}}, a friend of [[Albert Gleizes]], furnished the printing press. From January 1907 through January 1908, some twenty books were published by the ''Abbaye''.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; Barzun, more sophisticated than the other idealists of the Abbaye, introduced Gleizes to the specific history of Utopian socialism. Though Gleizes did not enter the Abbaye with a specific program in mind. The art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], is responsible for laying out the filiations between the Paul Fort's ''Vers et Prose'', the Abbaye, post-Symbolist writers and politically engaged aesthetic thinking that would lead Gleizes to [[Cubism]]. Robbin's pioneering work brought the history of the Abbaye to an Anglo-American readership. He characterized their endeavors as a 'search for a synthetic modern art' that gave expression to social ideas.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=daniel+robbins,+art+historian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm3Fni7YnF&amp;sig=fTwnbmUL87n5EYxZba-7bDhnYD4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bDLUo_ZGa2B7QbMk4HACA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20robbins%2C%20art%20historian&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1964 Guggenheim essay on Gleizes, Robbins developed these notions and summarized them as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A synthetic view of the universe, presenting the remarkable phenomena of time and space, multiplicity and diversity, at once was his painted equivalent to the ideals which were verbally realized in the Abbaye poetry. (Robbins, 1964)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Affiche Abbaye Créteil.jpg|thumb|Invitation for the 2nd exhibition of l'Abbaye as an art collective at rue du Moulin, Créteil, around 1907-08]]
Many artists visited the community and participated in its project, including the poet [[Pierre Jean Jouve]]; the musician {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Doyen|fr}}; the illustrator {{Interlanguage link multi|Berthold Mahn|fr}}; the painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Doucet|fr}}; {{Interlanguage link multi|Léon Bazalgette|fr}}, who had translated American poet [[Walt Whitman]]'s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' into French; and the writer [[Jules Romains]], founder of [[unanimism]].&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The fame of the Abbaye circulated even in Moscow, attracting many artists along the way. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] were visitors there and young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend Cubism), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux are some of the artists who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The Abbaye group, in principle supporting themselves through the communal work of publishing, were supported by many [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]]. Yet its members soon began to break with the art forms practiced by the respected older generation. Like many Symbolists, the Abbaye artists "scorned the structure of a bourgeois world and sought to substitute a communal society", writes Robbins, "but they did not reject the themes of modern life in favor of the Symbolist focus on single elements and internal, individual images".&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

They wished instead "to create an epic and heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory", Robbins continues, "an art dealing with the relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, even, ultimately, the city itself". The intentions of the Abbaye were vast and would ultimately remain unfulfilled. Their goal, like that of the Symbolists before them, was equivalent to an escape from reality. "Yet there were important distinctions", write Robbins, "for the Abbaye intention to create a total future a priori ruled out the Symbolist technique of creating solely from an aesthetic or a closed ideal".&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The ''Abbaye'' attracted much interest but little revenue and its young members found themselves forced to close their beloved ''Abbaye'' on January 28, 1908. Its publishing house survived for a while and the friends continued to gather every month for a ''dîner des copains'' (in French, "dinner of pals").&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1436722W/L'_abbaye_de_Créteil Christian Sénéchal, ''L' abbaye de Créteil''. Published 1930 by Delpeuch, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its dissolution, Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near [[Montmartre]], Paris, with artists {{Ill|Henri Doucet|fr}}, [[Amedeo Modigliani]], Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=gleizes,+%22simultaneous+movements+of+translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EIKQ9bxba&amp;sig=Ddnuo643ki8Urc433IuNhY4KzwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9XovVdD_Gor-ygPcioGIBA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%2C%20%22simultaneous%20movements%20of%20translation%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nuremberg Race Laws 73901.jpg|right|thumb|Nuremberg Race Laws]]

'''Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany''' comprised several laws that segregated the Jews from German society and restricted Jewish people's political, legal and civil rights. Major legislative initiatives included a series of restrictive laws passed in 1933, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and a final wave of legislation preceding Germany's entry into [[World War II]].

== 1933 Anti-Jewish Legislation ==

=== Enabling Act ===

The Enabling Act established the power of the Nazi Party to pass law [[by decree]], bypassing the approval of parliament. It was passed on March 24, 1933, and effectively nullified the [[Weimar Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz |last=Schleunes |first=Karl |year=1970 |location= |publisher= |isbn=978-0252000928 |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service ===

In April 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, or 'Civil Service Law', as it was more commonly known when passed, established the ability of the Nazi Party to legally remove undesirables from the civil service profession, including doctors, teachers and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=102–103|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local governments also did not allow for the Jews to slaughter animals. In turn, this prevented the Jews from obeying Jewish dietary laws.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This Law created the basis for the years to come, the Nazi party saw "racial purity [as a] condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=33|quote=Racial Purity was a condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Service Law was used to purify Germany through excluding Jews from key areas of the German community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service "defined the three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal". The first group included those who had been appointed after November 9, 1918, and could be removed if they did not have the proper training, which essentially meant anyone could fit into these standards. The Second group were those who were deemed by their past that they would not always support the national state. The third group were any "non-Aryans", a way of excluding the Jews without explicitly mentioning "Jews" in the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=103|quote="It defined three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law Concerning Admission to the Legal Profession ===

This act of legislation was also passed in April as a supplement to the Civil Service Law. This law specifically attacked judges and public prosecutors, and forbade any Jews from taking the bar exam which was necessary to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=105|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decree Regarding Physicians' Services with the National Health Service ===

This law affected Jewish doctors, and subsequently Jewish health care. Passed also in April, under this legislation, patients who saw a "non-Aryan" doctor would not be covered under the national health insurance, thus excluding Jewish doctors from German society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The Law Against the Over-Crowding of German Schools ===

Looking to further enact their racial agenda, the Nazi party then looked toward curbing educational policy. On April 25, 1933, the Law Against the Over-Crowding of German schools was passed, and required an end to any Weimar teachings that discussed democracy and equality; it enforced the teaching of racial pride. Under the guise of a concern for educational over-crowding, the Nazis limited the number of Jewish students enrolled in German schools to 1.5% of the total enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=1970|year=|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=106–107|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 1933 Citizenship and Denaturalization Law ===

With the goal of excluding Jews from having full citizenship rights an Advisory Committee for Population and Race Policy met at the ministry of the Interior to discuss a new citizenship law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=146|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was the Denaturalization Law passed on July 14. As a result of this law, the Reich government could take away the citizenship of those who were deemed "undesirable", applying to anyone who had been given citizenship by the Weimar government. Those who saw the results of this law first were the "150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=110|quote="... revoke the citizenship of people it considered to be undesirable." "...against the estimated 150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary Farm Law ===

Passed on September 29, 1933, this law "excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". It stated that only Germans could now be farmers. Though the law had minimal effect due to the lack of Jews involved in farming, it still displayed a central idea of the Nazi party that, "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=112|quote="excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Chambers of Culture ===

On September 29, 1933, the power of Jewish Cultural life in Germany was transferred to [[Joseph Goebbels]], who established chambers of culture that would regulate activity in their chamber of either film, theater, music, fine arts, literature, broadcasting, and the press.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=113|quote="producer of and actors in a movie to the ticket collectors in the theater". "Licensed permission from the chamber president."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Chamber had the power to exclude anyone involved in any of the facets of culture, even without an "Aryan clause" written into the legislation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For example, the film chamber could dismiss any Jews involved in any stages of the film-making process including the "producer, actors and ticket collectors in the theater". To continue involvement in the film industry one would need "licensed permission from the chamber president".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a supplement to the Chambers of Culture, a journalism law went into effect on October 4, 1933, stating that to produce work for the press, journalists and editors would also need specific legal permission.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==[[Nuremberg Laws]] ==
At their [[Nuremberg rallies|annual party rally held in Nuremberg]] in September 1935, the Nazi leaders announced a set of three new laws to further regulate and exclude Jews from German Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=120|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws now known as the Nuremberg laws served also as the legality for the arrests and violence against Jews that would come to follow.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=41–42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuremberg Laws were created in response to Hitler's demands for broadened citizenship laws that could "underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=148|quote="underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made to reflect the party principles that had been outlined in the points Hitler had written in the [[National Socialist Program]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reich Flag Law ===

The first law stated that black, red, and white were the national colors, and the swastika flag was the new national flag. Per Hitler, this law was stated to "re-pay a debt of gratitude to the movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=142|quote="Repay a debt of gratitude to the Movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship Law ===

The second law established who would be granted full political and civic rights and those who would now be deprived of them. Citizenship rights were to be granted to those who were citizens of the Reich, which were only individuals classified as being of "German or related blood"; therefore, Jews were excluded from any and all citizenship rights, becoming ''Staatsangehörige'' or state subjects,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; essentially making them foreigners in their own country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor ===

The third law forbade marriage and any relations between Jews and German citizens. The law also made any previously existing marriages or those contracted outside of Germany invalid. Furthermore, Jews were forbidden from employing German female citizens who were under 45 years old. Under this law, Jews were also forbidden to raise the German Flag.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Supplemental Decrees ===

After the Nuremberg Laws were passed, the Nazi Party also introduced supplemental decrees to the Citizenship Law and the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor to specifically outline who would be considered a Jew, and who would therefore be subject to the Nuremberg Laws' exclusionary principles

On November 14, the first supplemental decree was published, and it defined a Jewish person as anyone who had at least three full Jewish grandparents, had two Jewish grandparents and were married to a Jewish spouse, belonged to the Jewish religion at the time of the law's publication, or who entered the Jewish religion later.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=149|quote="between a Jew and a Mischling with one Jewish Grandparent, between a Mischling and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a Mischling with two Jewish Grandparents and a German."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mischling|''Mischlinge'']] or the German legal term for those who had "Aryan" and Jewish blood, were also clarified to determine who would be considered a Jew. Those that were three-quarters Jewish were Jewish as well as those who were half Jewish due to their choice of becoming Jewish via a Jewish spouse or through joining a Jewish community.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

A second decree was published on December 21, which stated that Jewish professors, teachers, physicians, lawyers, and notaries who were state employees, and had previously been exempt, would now be dismissed from their positions.

In the first decree to the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor, it stated which specific marriages were forbidden. These included those "between a Jew and a ''Mischling'' with one Jewish Grandparent, between a ''Mischling'' and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a ''Mischling'' with two Jewish Grandparents and a German".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Post-Nuremberg legislation ==

=== 1936 Berlin Olympic Games ===

In order to prevent foreign criticism of Germany, and keep the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and to prevent economic loss and a blow to German prestige, Hitler eased the anti-Jewish stance momentarily.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=9780252000928|location=|pages=126–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, all anti-Jewish signs near the site of the winter Olympics were to be removed. Though, normally, this would be considered a sign of good faith, it was, in actuality, only an action taken to ensure the Olympics would be held in Germany by preventing international disapproval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Second wave of anti-Jewish legislation, 1938-1939 ===
After the Nuremberg Legislations and during 1938, "worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase, 1938 was the fateful turning point."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=180|quote="worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase 1938 was the fateful turning point."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De-certification of all Jewish physicians, who were no longer allowed to treat German patients and forced to refer to themselves as "sick-treaters", a degrading term.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=410–411|quote="sick-treaters"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 22, 1938 Jews were forbidden from owning private gardens&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

July 27, 1938 A decree was enforced stating all streets in Germany needed to be re-named&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 12, 1938 Jews were forbidden from attending movie theaters, the opera, and concerts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 15, 1938 Jewish children barred from attending public school&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The essential robbery of Jews became legal when Jews were forced on February 21, 1939, to turn in all jewelry of any value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this second wave of legislation, Jews were ostracized even further from society, with strict restrictions living under "a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=413|quote="a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kristallnacht ==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-083-42, Magdeburg, zerstörtes jüdisches Geschäft.jpg|right|thumb|''Kristallnacht'', example of physical damage]]

[[Kristallnacht]] or the night of broken glass refers to Jewish pogroms that took place on November 9 and 10 in 1938. This wave of violence took place in Germany, annexed Austria, and areas of Sudetenland that were occupied by Germany.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005201|title=Kristallnacht|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks took place against synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses, other Jewish establishments, and Jewish citizens in general. More than 100 Jewish people were killed, and thousands more were arrested during these attacks.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Remembering Kristallnacht|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218742963|journal=The Jerusalem Report|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the start to organized Nazi attacks, and the mass incarceration of the Jews. There was no clear Instructions on how to execute the violence, so it caused the destroying of Jewish property and inhumane treatment of Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doescher|first=Hans|year=2011|title=Kristallnacht 1938|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873572091|journal=Shofar|volume=|pages=131–132|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and Sudetenland. The firefighter were instructed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings, but not to put the fires out on the burning synagogues. There was also about 7,500 Jewish-owned establishments that were robbed and had their windows shattered. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and moved to prisons or concentration camps as well. What made things even worse is the fact that the German government placed full blame on the Jews for the destructions and imposed a fine of one billion [[Reichsmark]] on the Jewish community. The government also took away all insurance payouts that would go to the Jews whose businesses or homes got destroyed. This left the Jews responsible for the costs of all repairs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

This led to many decrees in the weeks following. These decrees were designed to deprive the Jews of their means of living. Many of these movements enforced [[Aryanization (Nazism)|"Aryanization"]] policy. This meant that Jewish-owned property would be transferred to "Aryan" ownership for a fraction of the true value. To further remove the Jews from public life, the Jews were expelled from attending German schools, and they lost the right to have a driver's license or own an automobile.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Kristallnacht was essentially the turning point in the Nazis persecution of the Jewish people. It expanded the efforts to remove Jews from German economic and social life. It also led to forced emigration of Jews in order to make Germany free of Jews.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Kristallnacht and the events that followed it showed the Nazi regime that they could count on the nationwide support of anti-Semitism from the general public. This showed the Nazis that they could easily move forward with their plans without much opposition from within Germany. The events of Kristallnacht foreshadowed the Holocaust and mass murders of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Timeline of anti-Jewish legislation and movements in pre-war Germany ==
During the pre-war Nazi Germany period (1933-1939) there were more than 400 laws, decrees and other type of regulations whose goal was to restrict Jews. There were national laws that affected all Jews, and there were state, region and city laws that only affected the Jews in those communities. These regulations limited Jews in all aspects of life, both public and private. Almost all people were involved in the support of anti-Jewish legislation in some way, whether it was passive agreement or direct involvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681|title=ANTI-JEWISH LEGISLATION IN PRE-WAR GERMANY|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements were all part of Hitler's intention and plan to rid the planet of all Jewish population. Hitler's plan started with stripping all Jews of their basic rights, before moving into the mass murdering of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Steven|year=1994|title=ideas made the Holocaust- The Holocaust in Historical Context: The Holocaust and Mass Death before the Modern Age|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/210394559/|journal=Commonweal|volume=1|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], '''aparigraha''' ({{lang-sa|अपरिग्रह}}) is the [[virtue]] of [[Non-possession|non-possessiveness]], non-grasping or non-greediness.&lt;ref name=artidhand&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigrah is the opposite of ''parigrah'', and refers to keeping the desire for possessions to what is necessary or important, depending on one's life stage and context. The [[precept]] of ''aparigraha'' is a self-restraint ([[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]) from the type of [[greed]] and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Lauricella (2013), Judging by the way animals are treated: Gandhi as a manifestation of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Gandhi Marg Quarterly, 35(4): 655–674&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of [[dāna]] (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;SC Jain (2012), Spiritual Guidance in Achieving and Sustaining Organizational Excellence, Purushartha: A Journal of Management Ethics and Spirituality, 4(2): 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Kazanas (2013), Vedic Tradition and Civilization, in On India: Self-Image and Counter-image (Editor: AN Balslev), SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-8132110927}}, pages 27-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Aparigraha is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] in Sanskrit, made of "''a-''" and "''parigrah''". The prefix "''a-''" means "non-", so "''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;parigrah''" is the opposite of "''parigrah''", so ''aparigraha'' is speech and actions that oppose and negate ''parigraha.''

The word ''parigrah'' means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others.&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt; The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes.&lt;ref name=kjain&gt;K Jain, Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 30, Issue 11, pages 139-146&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first ''[[tirthankara]]'' in [[Jainism]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-YnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;dq=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEuaq_ofnaAhUVTI8KHUgCDagQ6AEIQjAG&lt;/ref&gt;

Monier-Williams states that the word ''"parigraha"'' has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, ''Parigraha'', A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 593&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Brahmana]]s and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt; In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt;

The virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as "abstaining from accepting gifts",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm The Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali] Verse 2.30&lt;/ref&gt; "not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person", and "not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted".&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/178/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 178-182&lt;/ref&gt; The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness,&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Mathur et al (2010), New Horizons in Indian Management, {{ISBN|978-8178357119}}, page 280&lt;/ref&gt; and non-[[compulsive hoarding|possessiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers | author = Nancy Gerstein | page = 140 | year = 2005 | publisher = Pendragon | isbn = 978-0-9722809-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of "letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Taylor (2008), End-of-Life Yoga Therapy: Exploring Life and Death, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF YOGA THERAPY, No. 18, pages 97-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Jainism}}
Aparigraha is one of the virtues in [[Jainism]]. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'') and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (''parimita-parigraha'') and limiting one’s desires (''iccha-parimana'').&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt;

In Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml Aparigraha - non-acquisition], Jainism, BBC Religions&lt;/ref&gt; Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy.&lt;ref name=mjwcr&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof (Editors), Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761927297}}, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt; Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life.&lt;ref name=valueeduc&gt;MR Mehta (in Editor: P. Kapur), Value Education, Volume 1, {{ISBN|81-7835-566-3}}, pages 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]], Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt;
==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]] (II.30), ''aparigraha'' is listed as the fifth [[Yamas]] or code of self-restraint, after with  [[Ahimsa]] (nonviolence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), [[Asteya]] (not stealing), and [[Brahmacharya]] (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein and Jeanine Miller (1997), The Essence of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-0892817382}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः ॥३०॥

Non-violence, Non-falsehood, Non-stealing, Non-cheating (celibacy, chastity), and Non-possessiveness are the five Yamas. (30)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/ Yoga Sutra], Sadhana Pada, [[sutra]] 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (''yamas'', "the don'ts") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (''niyamas'', "the dos") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten ''yamas'' and ''niyamas'', these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clarke (2014), Handbook of Research on Development and Religion, Elgar Reference, {{ISBN|978-0857933577}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Hornett (2013), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and the forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer, {{ISBN|978-3642324444}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-69&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wood states,&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; ''aparigraha'' is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in "acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://yogainternational.com/article/view/non-possessiveness-let-go-of-what-keeps-you-from-moving-forward Non-Possessiveness: Let Go of What Keeps You From Moving Forward] Irene Petryszak, Yoga International (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अपरिग्रहस्थैर्ये जन्मकथंतासंबोधः ॥३९॥

With constancy of ''aparigraha'', a spiritual illumination of the how and why of motives and birth emerges. (39)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.39&lt;ref name=jw2&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/186/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Restraint from possessiveness and greed, or ''aparigraha'', leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of [[Sādhanā]], path of spiritual existence.&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; In outer world, ''aparigraha'' manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.&lt;ref&gt;KM George (2014), Toward a Eucharistic Missiology, International Review of Mission, 103(2), 309-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to charity and conservation==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Shonil A. Bhagwat, Yoga and Sustainability, The Journal of Yoga, Fall/Winter 2008, Volume 7, Number 1, pages 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.&lt;ref&gt;C. Betal (2008), CONSERVATION OF ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH YOGIC LIFESTYLE, Journal of Environmental Research And Development Vol, 2(4), pages 905-911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DK Taneja (2014), Yoga and health, Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39(2), pages 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.

==Difference from Asteya ==
[[Asteya]] is also one of the five vows taken by [[Jain]] ascetic monks to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Jainism+asteya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp8Mb9ovnaAhVL6Y8KHTyVCHkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jainism%20asteya&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Farhi (2011), Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit: A Return to Wholeness, MacMillan, {{ISBN|978-0805059700}}, pages 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120827462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">In [[mathematics]], '''categorification''' is the process of replacing [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[theorem]]s by [[category theory|category-theoretic]] analogues. Categorification, when done successfully, replaces [[set (mathematics)|set]]s by [[category (category theory)|categories]], [[function (mathematics)|function]]s with [[functor]]s, and [[equation]]s by [[natural transformation|natural isomorphisms]] of functors satisfying additional properties.  The term was coined by [[Louis Crane]].

The reverse of categorification is the process of ''decategorification''. Decategorification is a systematic process by which [[morphism|isomorphic]] objects in a category are identified as [[equality (mathematics)|equal]]. Whereas decategorification is a straightforward process, categorification is usually much less straightforward, and requires insight into individual situations.

The word (de)categorification doesn't refer to a precise mathematical procedure, but rather to a class of possible analogues. It's used in a similar way to the words like '[[generalization]]', and not like '[[sheafification]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mathoverflow.net/a/4880/38821 | title = What precisely Is “Categorification”? | author = Alex Hoffnung | date = 2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the context of an object suggests a natural direction for a categorification of it. For example, in [[representation theory]] of [[Lie algebra]]s mathematicians study [[module over a ring|modules]] over some specific algebras. In this case, there are several frameworks for what exactly a categorification of such a module should be, e.g., so called (weak) abelian categorifications, discussed later in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Mikhail|last1=Khovanov|author1-link=Mikhail Khovanov|first2=Volodymyr|last2=Mazorchuk|first3=Catharina|last3=Stroppel|author3-link= Catharina Stroppel |arxiv=math.RT/0702746 |title=A brief review of abelian categorifications|journal=Theory Appl. Categ.|volume=22|number=19|year=2009|pages=479–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of categorification==
One form of categorification takes a structure described in terms of sets, and interprets the sets as ''isomorphism classes'' of objects in a category.  For example, the set of [[Natural number|natural numbers]] can be seen as the set of ''cardinalities'' of finite sets (and any two sets with the same cardinality are isomorphic).  In this case, operations on the set of natural numbers, such as addition and multiplication, can be seen as carrying information about [[Product (category theory)|products]] and [[Coproduct|coproducts]] of the [[category of finite sets]].  Less abstractly, the idea here is that manipulating sets of actual objects, and taking coproducts (combining two sets in a union) or products (building arrays of things to keep track of large numbers of them) came first.  Later, the concrete structure of sets was abstracted away – taken "only up to isomorphism", to produce the abstract theory of arithmetic.  This is a "decategorification" – categorification reverses this step.

Other examples include [[homology theory|homology theories]] in [[topology]]. [[Emmy Noether]] gave the modern formulation of homology as the [[Rank of a group|rank]] of certain [[Free abelian group|free abelian groups]] by categorifying the notion of a [[Betti number]].{{sfn|Baez|1998}} See also [[Khovanov homology]] as a [[knot invariant]] in [[knot theory]].

An example in finite group theory is that the [[ring of symmetric functions]] is categorified by the category of representations of the [[symmetric group]]. The decategorification map sends the [[Specht module]] indexed by partition &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; to the [[schur class|schur function]] indexed by the same partition:

&lt;math&gt;S^\lambda \stackrel{\varphi}{\to} s_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

(essentially following the [[Character (mathematics)|character]] map from a favorite basis of the associated [[Grothendieck group]] to a representation-theoretic favorite basis of the ring of [[symmetric functions]]). This map reflects much of the parallels in structure; for example

&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{Ind}_{S_m \otimes S_n}^{S_{n+m}}(S^{\mu} \otimes S^{\nu})] \qquad \text{ and } \qquad s_\mu s_\nu &lt;/math&gt;

have the same decomposition numbers over their respective bases, both given by [[Littlewood–Richardson rule|Littlewood-Richardson coefficients]].

==Abelian categorifications==
For a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;K(\mathcal{B})&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Grothendieck group]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is [[Free abelian group|free as an abelian group]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \{a_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; be a basis of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that the multiplication is positive in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

 &lt;math&gt;a_i a_j = \sum_{k} c_{ij}^k a_k,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; c_{ij}^k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-[[Module (mathematics)|module]]. Then a (weak) abelian categorification of &lt;math&gt;(A, \mathbf{a}, B)&lt;/math&gt; consists of an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, an isomorphism &lt;math&gt; \phi: K(\mathcal{B}) \to B&lt;/math&gt;, and exact endofunctors &lt;math&gt;F_i: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that

# the functor &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; lifts the action of &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; on the module &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\phi [F_i] = a_i \phi&lt;/math&gt;, and
# there are isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;F_i F_j \cong \bigoplus_{k} F_k^{c_{ij}^k},&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the composition &lt;math&gt;F_i F_j&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as the direct sum of functors &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; in the same way that the product &lt;math&gt;a_i a_j&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as the linear combination of basis elements &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Rights |Distinctions}}

Some [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[political science|political scientists]] make a distinction between '''claim rights''' and '''liberty rights'''. A ''claim right'' is a [[rights|right]] which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. In contrast, a ''liberty right'' is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/may/rights.html|title=THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RIGHT AND A LIBERTY by Prof. William E. May|website=www.christendom-awake.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The distinction between these two senses of "rights" originates in American jurist [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]]'s analysis thereof in his seminal work ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions, As Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/2005/9.html|title=Hohfeld's Analysis of Rights: An Essential Approach to a Conceptual &amp; Practical Understanding of the Nature of Rights - [2005] MurUEJL 9|website=classic.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited. This is because the [[deontic logic|deontic]] concepts of obligation and permission&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tappolet|first=Christine|title=Evaluative vs. Deontic Concepts|date=2013-02-01|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of Ethics|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|isbn=9781405186414|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[De Morgan dual]]; a person is permitted to do all and only the things he is not obliged to refrain from, and obliged to do all and only the things he is not permitted to refrain from.

==Overview==
A person's ''liberty right to x'' consists in his freedom to do or have ''x'', while a person's ''claim right to x'' consists in an obligation on others to allow or enable him to do or have ''x''. For example, to assert a ''liberty right'' to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to assert that you have permission to speak freely; that is, that you are not doing anything wrong by speaking freely. But that liberty right does not in itself entail that others are obligated to help you communicate the things you wish to say, or even that they would be wrong in preventing you from speaking freely. To say these things would be to assert a ''claim right'' to free speech; to assert that others are obliged to refrain (i.e. prohibited) from preventing you from speaking freely (that is, that it would be wrong for them to do so) or even perhaps obliged to aid your efforts at communication (that is, it would be wrong for them to refuse such aid). Conversely, such claim rights do not entail liberty rights; e.g. laws prohibiting [[vigilante justice]] (establishing a legal claim right to be free thereof) do not thereby condone or permit all the acts which such violent enforcement might otherwise have prevented.

To illustrate, a world with only liberty rights, without any claim rights, would by definition be a world wherein everything was permitted and no act or omission was prohibited; a world wherein none could rightly claim that they had been wronged or neglected. Conversely, a world with only claim rights and no liberty rights would be a world wherein nothing was merely permitted, but all acts were either obligatory or prohibited. The assertion that people have a claim right to liberty – i.e. that people are obliged only to refrain from preventing each other from doing things which are permissible, their liberty rights limited only by the obligation to respect others' liberty – is the central thesis of [[Liberalism|liberal]] theories of [[justice]].

==Second-order rights==
Hohfeld's original analysis included two other types of right: besides ''claims'' (or ''rights'' proper) and ''liberties'' (or ''privileges''), he wrote of ''powers'', and ''immunities''. The other two terms of Hohfeld's analysis, ''powers'' and ''immunities'', refer to second-order liberties and claims, respectively. Powers are liberty rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has certain powers to modify some of U.S. citizens' [[legal rights]], inasmuch as it can impose or remove legal duties. Immunities, conversely, are claim rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. U.S. citizens have, per their [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], certain immunities limiting the positive powers of the U.S. Congress to modify their legal rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/additional-amendments/|title=Additional Amendments - Bill of Rights Institute|work=Bill of Rights Institute|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, immunities and powers are often subsumed within claims and liberties by later authors, or grouped together into "active rights" (liberties and powers) and "passive rights" (claims and immunities)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=R.|date=2014-02-01|title=UN Immunity or Impunity? A Human Rights Based Challenge|url=https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/25/1/239/497359|journal=European Journal of International Law|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=239–254|doi=10.1093/ejil/cht082|issn=0938-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These different types of rights can be used as building blocks to explain relatively complex matters such as a particular piece of property. For example, a right to use one's computer can be thought of as a liberty right, but one has a power right to let somebody else use your computer (granting them a liberty right), as well as a claim right against others using the computer; and further, you may have ''immunity rights'' protecting your claims and liberties regarding the computer.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''concept map''' or '''conceptual diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that depicts suggested relationships between [[concept]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. ''Designing &amp; Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations,'' 1997, . 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a graphical tool that [[instructional designer]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Technical communication|technical writers]], and others use to organize and structure [[knowledge]].

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in '''linking phrases''' such as ''causes'', ''requires'', or ''contributes to''.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;[[Joseph D. Novak]] &amp; Alberto J. Cañas (2006). [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm "The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them"], [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]]. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] these relationships among different concepts is called ''concept mapping''. Concept maps have been used to define the [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of computer systems, for example with the [[object-role modeling]] or [[Unified Modeling Language]] formalism.

== Overview ==
A concept map is a way of representing relationships between [[idea]]s, [[image]]s, or [[word]]s in the same way that a [[sentence diagram]] represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a [[circuit diagram]] represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.{{clarify|why is this noteworthy?|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062626/http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept maps were developed{{according to whom|date=November 2016}} to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. A well-made concept map grows within a ''context frame'' defined by an explicit "focus question", while a [[mind map]] often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on [[declarative memory]] content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., &amp; Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036&amp;ndash;1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* ''Topic maps'': Concept maps are rather similar to [[topic map]]s in that both allow to concepts or topics via [[graph (data structure)|graphs]]. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by [[Joseph D. Novak|Joseph Novak]] is unique in its philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J.D. &amp; Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mind maps'': Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with [[mind mapping]], which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by [[Joseph D. Novak]] and his research team at [[Cornell University]] in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]], who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or ''assimilate'') new concepts: "The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that a "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of ''off-loading''. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa&lt;ref&gt;Sowa, J.F., 1983. ''Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine'', Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper by Sweller &amp; Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J. &amp; Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 8(4), p.351-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using ''nodes'' and ''relationships'', allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6(3), p.251–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.&lt;ref&gt;Birbili, M. (2006) [http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v8n2/birbili.html "Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education"], ''Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice'', ''8(2)'', Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''knowledge arena'' is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt; Concept mapping is also sometimes used for [[brain-storming]]. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in [[software design]], where a common usage is [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument &amp;mdash; similar to [[argument map]]s.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*[[Note taking]] and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming [[tacit knowledge]] into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advance organizers" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advanced organizers" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, [[train of thought]], or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing [[metacognition]] (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

The '''counterculture of the 1960s''' was an [[anti-establishment]] cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the [[Western world]] between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] continued to grow, and would later become revolutionary with the expansion of the U.S. government's extensive [[Vietnam War|military intervention in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Donald Hirsch|Hirsch, E. D.]] (1993). ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-65597-9}}. p. 419. "Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. in the 1960s and affected Europe before fading in the 1970s&amp;nbsp; ... fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson| first = Terry H.| title = The Movement and the Sixties| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1995| isbn = 978-0-19-510457-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Judson R.|title=Current Perspectives on Social Problems|date=1973|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Co.|location=Belmont, California|isbn=978-0-534-00289-3|page=2|edition=Third|quote=Culture is the "social heritage" of society. It includes the complex set of learned and shared beliefs, customs, skills, habits, traditions, and knowledge common to the members of society. Within a culture, there may be subcultures made up of specific groups that are somewhat separate from the rest of society because of distinct traits, beliefs, or interests.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding [[human sexuality]], [[Second-wave feminism|women's rights]], traditional modes of authority, experimentation with [[psychoactive drug]]s, and differing interpretations of the [[American Dream]]. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/POLSC301-9.1.3-Counterculture.pdf|title=Counterculture|last=|first=|date=|website=saylor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the era unfolded, new cultural forms and a dynamic [[Zeitgeist|subculture]] which celebrated experimentation, modern incarnations of [[Bohemianism]], and the rise of the [[hippie]] and other alternative lifestyles, emerged. This embracing of creativity is particularly notable in the works of [[British Invasion]] bands such as [[The Beatles]], and filmmakers whose works became far less restricted by censorship. In addition to the trendsetting Beatles, many other creative artists, authors, and thinkers, within and across many disciplines, helped define the counterculture movement.

Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian movements]] of previous eras. The post-World War II "[[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]]"&lt;ref name="CNN 2011-08-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2011/08/11/pf/recession_birth_rate/chart-birth-rate-2.top.gif |format=GIF |title=Birth Rate Chart |work=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=August 11, 2011 |quote=Annotated Chart of 20th Century US Birth Rates }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomerslife.org/baby_boom_population_us_census_bureau_by_state.htm |title=Baby Boom population - U.S. Census Bureau - USA and by state |publisher=Boomerslife.org |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated an unprecedented number of potentially disaffected young people as prospective participants in a rethinking of the direction of American and other democratic societies.&lt;ref name="Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Student Protest in the 1960s |journal=Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute: Curriculum Unit 79.02.03 |year=1979 |last=Churney |first=Linda |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1979/2/79.02.03.x.html |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote=This unit focuses on student protest in the 60s }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war affluence allowed many of the counterculture generation to move beyond a focus on the provision of the material necessities of life that had preoccupied their [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] parents.&lt;ref name="KidnerBucur2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Kidner|author2=Maria Bucur|author3=Ralph Mathisen|author4=Sally McKee |author5=Theodore Weeks|title=Making Europe: People, Politics, and Culture, Volume II: Since 1550|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIMSNu5OFHoC&amp;pg=PA831|date=December 27, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-00481-2|pages=831–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era was also notable in that a significant portion of the array of behaviors and "causes" within the larger movement were quickly assimilated within mainstream society, particularly in the US, even though counterculture participants numbered in the clear minority within their respective national populations.&lt;ref name="RubinCasper2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Joan Shelley Rubin|author2=Professor Scott E.

The counterculture era essentially commenced in earnest with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in November 1963. It became absorbed into the [[popular culture]] with the termination of US combat military involvement in Southeast Asia and the end of the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] in 1973, and ultimately with the [[Watergate scandal#Resignation|resignation]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1974.

===Social issues and calls to action===

Many social issues fueled the growth of the larger counterculture movement. One was a nonviolent movement in the United States seeking to resolve constitutional civil rights illegalities, especially regarding general [[racial segregation]], longstanding [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] of blacks in the South by white-dominated state government, and ongoing racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and access to public places in both the North and the South.

In retrospect, this book really launched the environmental movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to address minority rights of women, gay people, the handicapped, and many other neglected constituencies within the larger population came to the forefront as an increasing number of primarily younger people broke free from the constraints of 1950s orthodoxy and struggled to create a more inclusive and tolerant social landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Skrentny, John (2002).

The availability of new and more effective forms of [[birth control]] was a key underpinning of the [[sexual revolution]]. The notion of "recreational sex" without the threat of unwanted pregnancy radically changed the social dynamic and permitted both women and men much greater freedom in the selection of sexual lifestyles outside the confines of traditional marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/ |title=American Experience &amp;#124; The Pill |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this change in attitude, by the 1990s the ratio of children born out of wedlock rose from 5% to 25% for Whites and from 25% to 66% for African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/99-09.pdf |title=Determinants of Planned and Unplanned Childbearing among Unmarried Women in the United States |last1=Musick |first1=Kelly |date=April 1999 |website=wisconsin.edu |publisher=Center for Demography and Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====

For those born after [[World War II]], the emergence of television as a source of entertainment and information—as well as the associated massive expansion of [[consumerism]] afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV [[advertising]]—were key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as [[ad agencies]] heavily courted the "hip" youth market.&lt;ref name="Frank1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Frank|title=The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHyIY2cctQIC&amp;pg=PA132|date=December 1, 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-26012-9|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonHerr2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary L.

====New cinema====

The end of censorship resulted in a complete reformation of the western film industry. With new-found artistic freedom, a generation of exceptionally talented [[New Hollywood|New Wave]] film makers working across all genres brought realistic depictions of previously prohibited subject matter to neighborhood theater screens for the first time, even as [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios were still considered a part of the establishment by some elements of the counterculture.

====New radio====
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|A family watches television, {{circa|1958}}]]
By the later 1960s, previously under-regarded [[FM radio]] replaced [[AM radio]] as the focal point for the ongoing explosion of [[rock and roll]] music, and became the nexus of youth-oriented news and advertising for the counterculture generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Christopher &amp; Keith, Michael (2008).

===Changing lifestyles===

[[Commune]]s, [[collective]]s, and [[intentional communities]] regained popularity during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Power|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57h.asp|website=ushistory.org|publisher=ushistory.org/Independence Hall Association|accessdate=July 28, 2014|date=2014|quote=Like the utopian societies of the 1840s, over 2000 rural communes formed during these turbulent times. Completely rejecting the capitalist system, many communes rotated duties, made their own laws, and elected their own leaders. Some were philosophically based, but others were influenced by new religions. Earth-centered religions, astrological beliefs, and Eastern faiths proliferated across American campuses. Some scholars labeled this trend as the Third Great Awakening.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early communities, such as the [[Hog Farm]], [[Quarry Hill Creative Center|Quarry Hill]], and [[Drop City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616390/One-Americas-hippies-dies-94-founding-infamous-retreat.html |title=One of America's first 'hippies' dies at 94 after founding famous Vermont retreat

in the US were established as straightforward [[back to the land movement|agrarian]] attempts to return to the land and live free of interference from outside influences. As the era progressed, many people established and populated new communities in response to not only disillusionment with standard community forms, but also dissatisfaction with certain elements of the counterculture itself. Some of these self-sustaining communities have been credited with the birth and propagation of the international [[Green Politics|Green Movement]].

The emergence of an interest in expanded spiritual consciousness, [[yoga]], [[occult]] practices and increased [[Human Potential Movement|human potential]] helped to shift views on organized religion during the era. In 1957, 69% of US residents polled by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] said religion was increasing in influence. By the late 1960s, polls indicated less than 20% still held that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103459/Questions-Answers-About-Americans-Religion.aspx# |title=Questions and Answers About Americans' Religion |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Generation Gap]]", or the inevitable perceived divide in worldview between the old and young, was perhaps never greater than during the counterculture era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/1960s/videos/ask-steve-generation-gap#ask-steve-hippie-vs-yippie |title=Ask Steve: Generation Gap (Video)|website=history.com |publisher=History Channel/A&amp;E|quote=Explore the existence of the generation gap that took place in the 1960s through this Ask Steve video. Steve Gillon explains there was even a larger gap between the Baby Boomers themselves than the Baby Boomers and the Greatest Generation. The massive Baby Boomers Generation was born between 1946 and 1964, consisting of nearly 78 million people. The Baby Boomers were coming of age in the 1960s, and held different cultural values than the Greatest Generation. The Greatest Generation lived in a time of self-denial, while the Baby Boomers were always seeking immediate gratification. However, the Baby Boomers were more divided amongst themselves. Not all of them were considered hippies and protesters. In fact, people under the age of 28 supported the Vietnam War in greater numbers than their parents. These divisions continue to play out today. |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large measure of the generational chasm of the 1960s and early 1970s was born of rapidly evolving fashion and hairstyle trends that were readily adopted by the young, but often misunderstood and ridiculed by the old. These included the wearing of very long hair by men,&lt;ref name="Macan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Macan|title=Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b98dJ3cYAksC&amp;pg=PT127|date=November 11, 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988009-6|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wearing of natural or "[[Afro]]" hairstyles by black people, the donning of revealing clothing by women in public, and the mainstreaming of the psychedelic clothing and regalia of the short-lived hippie culture. Ultimately, practical and comfortable casual apparel, namely updated forms of [[T-shirts]] (often [[tie-dyed]], or emblazoned with political or advertising statements), and [[Levi's|Levi Strauss-branded]] blue denim jeans&lt;ref name="CunninghamLab1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Anne Cunningham|author2=Susan Voso Lab|title=Dress and Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoXKtfx4weoC&amp;pg=PA31|year=1991|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-507-5|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the enduring uniform of the generation. The fashion dominance of the counterculture effectively ended with the rise of the [[Disco]] and [[Punk Rock]] eras in the later 1970s, even as the global popularity of T-shirts, denim jeans, and casual clothing in general have continued to grow.

====Emergent middle-class drug culture====
In the western world, the ongoing criminal legal status of the recreational drug industry was instrumental in the formation of an anti-establishment social dynamic by some of those coming of age during the counterculture era. The explosion of [[marijuana]] use during the era, in large part by students on fast-expanding college campuses,&lt;ref name="The Nation 1966-01-31"&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Mervin B. |last2=Powelson |first2=Harvey |url=http://thenation.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/drugsoncampus1966.pdf |title=Drugs on Campus: Turned On &amp; Tuned Out |work=The Nation |location=New York |publisher=Nation Co.

The [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States|classification of marijuana as a narcotic]], and the attachment of severe criminal penalties for its use, drove the act of smoking marijuana, and experimentation with substances in general, deep underground.

===Law enforcement===
[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|upright|thumb|Anti-war protesters]]
The confrontations between college students (and other activists) and law enforcement officials became one of the hallmarks of the era. Many younger people began to show deep distrust of police, and terms such as "[[List of police-related slang terms|fuzz]]" and "pig" as derogatory [[epithets]] for police reappeared, and became key words within the counterculture lexicon. The distrust of police was based not only on fear of [[police brutality]] during political protests, but also on generalized police corruption - especially police manufacture of false evidence, and outright entrapment, in drug cases. In the US, the social tension between elements of the counterculture and law enforcement reached the breaking point in many notable cases, including: the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/timeline |title=1968:Columbia in Crisis |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University Libraries |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html |title=Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War, and the protracted national divide between supporters and opponents of the war, were arguably the most important factors contributing to the rise of the larger counterculture movement.

The widely accepted assertion that anti-war opinion was held only among the young is a myth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seanet.com/~jimxc/Politics/Mistakes/Vietnam_support.html |title=Support for Vietnam War |publisher=Seanet.com |date=November 21, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/commentary/?analysisid=57 |title=Generations Divide Over Military Action in Iraq - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=October 17, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enormous war protests consisting of thousands of mostly younger people in every major US city, and elsewhere across the Western world, effectively united millions against the war, and against the war policy that prevailed under five US congresses and during two presidential administrations.

===In Western Europe===
The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with London, Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Copenhagen and West Berlin rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers.[[File:Londons Carnaby Street, 1966.jpg|thumb|left| Carnaby Street, London, 1966]]

The [[UK Underground]] was a movement linked to the growing subculture in the US and associated with the hippie phenomenon, generating its own magazines and newspapers, fashion, music groups, and clubs. Underground figure [[Barry Miles]] said, "The underground was a catch-all sobriquet for a community of like-minded anti-establishment, anti-war, pro-rock'n'roll individuals, most of whom had a common interest in recreational drugs. They saw peace, exploring a widened area of consciousness, love and sexual experimentation as more worthy of their attention than entering the rat race. The straight, consumerist lifestyle was not to their liking, but they did not object to others living it. But at that time the middle classes still felt they had the right to impose their values on everyone else, which resulted in conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=Spirit of the underground: the 60s rebel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/30/underground-arts-60s-rebel-counterculture|website=theguardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] was a counterculture movement that focused on "provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait."&lt;ref name="Tusman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Tusman|title=Really Free Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA159|publisher=PediaPress|pages=159–|id=GGKEY:UWBUGNHU1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the [[May 1968 in France|General Strike]] centered in Paris in May 1968 united French students, and nearly toppled the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinfels|first1=Peter|title=Paris, May 1968: The revolution that never was (Analysis)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/world/europe/11iht-paris.4.12777919.html?_r=0|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Co.|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=May 11, 2008|quote=Regrettably or not, the fire of 1968 has died down.

[[Kommune 1]] or K1 was a commune in West Germany, and was known for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between [[satire]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]. These events served as inspiration for the "[[Revolutionary spontaneity|Sponti]]" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstraße in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music and drugs. Soon, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, including [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;''Keith Richards: The Biography'', by Victor Bockris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berke1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph H.

===In Eastern Europe===

''[[Mánička]]'' is a [[Czech language|Czech]] term used for young people with long hair, usually males, in [[Czechoslovakia]] through the 1960s and 1970s. Long hair for males during this time was considered an expression of political and social attitudes in [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|communist Czechoslovakia]]. From the mid-1960s, the long-haired and "untidy" persons (so called ''máničky'' or ''vlasatci'' (in English: [[wikt:Mops|Mops]]) were banned from entering pubs, cinema halls, theatres and using public transportation in several Czech cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"&gt;[[#Pokorná|Pokorná (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the public transportation regulations in [[Most (Most District)|Most]] and [[Litvínov]] excluded long-haired ''máničky'' as displeasure-evoking persons. Two years later, the municipal council in [[Poděbrady]] banned ''máničky'' from entering cultural institutions in the town.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; In August 1966, ''[[Rudé právo]]'' informed that ''máničky'' in [[Prague]] were banned from visiting restaurants of the I. and II. price category.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

In 1966, during a big campaign coordinated by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], around 4,000 young males were forced to cut their hair, often in the cells with the assistance of the state police.&lt;ref name="radioprague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/127919|title=Háro a Vraťe nám vlasy!|last=Faltýnek|first=Vilém|date=2010-05-16|website=[[Czech Radio|Radio Praha]]|language=Czech|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 1966, during a "safety intervention" organized by the state police, 140 long-haired people were arrested. As a response, the "community of long-haired" organized a protest in [[Prague]]. More than 100 people cheered slogans such as "Give us back our hair!" or "Away with hairdressers!". The state police arrested the organizers and several participants of the meeting. Some of them were given prison sentences.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; According to the newspaper ''[[Mladá fronta Dnes]]'', the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior in 1966 even compiled a detailed map of the frequency of occurrence of long-haired males in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct24.cz/domaci/97481-policejni-akce-vlasatci-kniha-vratte-nam-vlasy-prinasi-nove-dokumenty/|title=Policejní akce Vlasatci - kniha Vraťte nám vlasy přináší nové dokumenty|publisher=[[Česká televize]]|language=Czech|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1969, during the first anniversary of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the long-haired youth were one of the most active voices in the state protesting against the occupation.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; Youth protesters have been labeled as "vagabonds" and "slackers" by the official [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalized]] press.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine was first published as a satirical humour magazine between 1963 and 1969 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and, in its second and better known incarnation, became a "psychedelic hippy" magazine from 1967 to 1973 in [[London]].

In Mexico, rock music was tied into the youth revolt of the 1960s. Mexico City, as well as northern cities such as [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Tijuana]], were exposed to US music. Many Mexican rock stars became involved in the counterculture. The three-day [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro]], held in 1971, was organized in the valley of Avándaro near the city of [[Toluca]], a town neighboring Mexico City, and became known as "The Mexican Woodstock". Nudity, drug use, and the presence of the US flag scandalized conservative Mexican society to such an extent that the government clamped down on rock and roll performances for the rest of the decade. The festival, marketed as proof of Mexico's modernization, was never expected to attract the masses it did, and the government had to evacuate stranded attendees en masse at the end. This occurred during the era of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Luis Echeverría]], an extremely repressive era in Mexican history. Anything that could be connected to the counterculture or student protests was prohibited from being broadcast on public airwaves, with the government fearing a repeat of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student protests]] of 1968. Few bands survived the prohibition; though the ones that did, like Three Souls in My Mind (now [[El Tri]]), remained popular due in part to their adoption of Spanish for their lyrics, but mostly as a result of a dedicated underground following. While Mexican rock groups were eventually able to perform publicly by the mid-1980s, the ban prohibiting tours of Mexico by foreign acts lasted until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-21514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cordobazo]] was a civil uprising in the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina]], in the end of May 1969, during the military dictatorship of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], which occurred a few days after the ''[[Rosariazo]]'', and a year after the French [[May '68]]. Contrary to previous protests, the Cordobazo did not correspond to previous struggles, headed by [[Marxist]] workers' leaders, but associated students and workers in the same struggle against the [[Military dictatorship|military government]].&lt;ref name=Bermand&gt;Carmen Bernand, « D'une rive à l'autre », ''Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Materiales de seminarios'', 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the [[EHESS]]), Put on line on June 15, 2008.

===Civil Rights Movement===
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}

The Civil Rights Movement, a key element of the larger counterculture movement, involved the use of applied [[nonviolence]] to assure that equal rights guaranteed under the [[US Constitution]] would apply to all citizens. Many states illegally denied many of these rights to African-Americans, and this was successfully addressed in the early and mid-1960s in several major nonviolent movements.&lt;ref name="HillBuckler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett D.

===Free Speech===
{{Main|Free Speech Movement}}

Much of the 1960s counterculture originated on college campuses. The 1964 Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, which had its roots in the Civil Rights Movement of the [[southern United States]], was one early example. At Berkeley a group of students began to identify themselves as having interests as a class that were at odds with the interests and practices of the University and its corporate sponsors. Other rebellious young people, who were not students, also contributed to the Free Speech Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsm-a.org/ |title=Free Speech Movement Archives Home Page - events from 1964 and beyond |publisher=FSM-A |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Left===
{{Main|New Left}}

The ''New Left'' is a term used in different countries to describe [[left-wing]] movements that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in the [[Western world]]. They differed from earlier leftist movements that had been more oriented towards [[labour movement|labour]] activism, and instead adopted [[social activism]]. The US "New Left" is associated with college campus mass protests and radical leftist movements. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "[[Old Left]]" parties in the post-World War II period. The movements began to wind down in the 1970s, when activists either committed themselves to party projects, developed [[social justice]] organizations, moved into [[identity politics]] or [[alternative lifestyles]], or became politically inactive.&lt;ref name="Marcuse2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Marcuse|title=The New Left and the 1960s: Collected Papers of Herbert Marcuse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML6GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=October 14, 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-77459-3|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almeida2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dimitri Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD7bKbo0FYEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=April 27, 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-34039-0|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchanan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Buchanan|title=Europe's Troubled Peace: 1945 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAHcBeZhm6UC&amp;pg=PA102|date=January 30, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-65578-8|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], was an influential [[libertarian socialist]] thinker on the radical student movements of the era&lt;ref&gt;"During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as "the guru of the New Left," publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism."

The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in America, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy].

By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement."

Opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] began in 1964 on United States college campuses. Student activism became a dominant theme among the baby boomers, growing to include many other demographic groups. Exemptions and deferments for the middle and upper classes resulted in the induction of a disproportionate number of poor, working-class, and minority registrants. Countercultural books such as [[MacBird]] by [[Barbara Garson]] and much of the counterculture music encouraged a spirit of non-conformism and anti-establishmentarianism. By 1968, the year after a large march [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|to the United Nations]] in [[New York City]] and a large protest at the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Pentagon]] were undertaken, a majority of people in the country opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Feminism===
{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}
The role of women as full-time homemakers in industrial society was challenged in 1963, when US feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', giving momentum to the women's movement and influencing what many called [[Second-wave feminism]]. Other activists, such as [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[Angela Davis]], either organized, influenced, or educated many of a younger generation of women to endorse and expand feminist thought. Feminism gained further currency within the protest movements of the late 1960s, as women in movements such as [[Students for a Democratic Society]] rebelled against the "support" role they had been consigned to within the male-dominated New Left, as well as against manifestations and statements of [[sexism]] within some radical groups. The 1970 pamphlet ''Women and Their Bodies'', soon expanded into the 1971 book ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'', was particularly influential in bringing about the new feminist consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/history/us-history-ii/the-new-frontier-and-the-great-society/the-counterculture-of-the-1960s|title=The Counterculture of the 1960s|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s counterculture embraced a [[Back-to-the-land movement|back-to-the-land]] ethic, and communes of the era often relocated to the country from cities. Influential books of the 1960s included [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' and [[Paul Ehrlich]]'s ''[[The Population Bomb]]''. Counterculture environmentalists were quick to grasp the implications of Ehrlich's writings on [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], the Hubbert "[[peak oil]]" prediction, and more general concerns over [[pollution]], [[litter]], the environmental effects of the Vietnam War, automobile-dependent lifestyles, and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. More broadly they saw that the dilemmas of energy and resource allocation would have implications for geo-politics, lifestyle, environment, and other dimensions of modern life. The "back to nature" theme was already prevalent in the counterculture by the time of the 1969 Woodstock festival, while the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970 was significant in bringing environmental concerns to the forefront of youth culture. At the start of the 1970s, counterculture-oriented publications like the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and ''[[The Mother Earth News]]'' were popular, out of which emerged a [[back to the land]] movement. The 1960s and early 1970s counterculture were early adopters of practices such as [[recycling]] and [[organic farming]] long before they became mainstream. The counterculture interest in [[ecology]] progressed well into the 1970s: particularly influential were New Left eco-anarchist [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Jerry Mander]]'s criticism of the effects of [[television]] on society, [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s novel ''[[Ecotopia]]'', [[Edward Abbey]]'s fiction and non-fiction writings, and [[E.F. Schumacher]]'s economics book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]''.

===Gay liberation===

[[File:Stonewall Inn 1969.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village, New York City, September 1969]]

The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], a gay bar in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. This is frequently cited as the first instance in US history when people in the gay community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and became the defining event that marked the start of the [[Gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.

==Culture and lifestyles==

===Hippies===
{{Further|History of the hippie movement}}

After the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]] in [[San Francisco]] organized by artist [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]], the media's attention on culture was fully activated.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Lee, Acid Dreams The CIA, LSD, and the Sixties Rebellion, [[Grove Press]] 1985, Pgs.&amp;nbsp;157–163 {{ISBN|978-0-394-62081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Scott McKenzie]]'s rendition of the song "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]" brought as many as 100,000 young people from all over the world to celebrate San Francisco's "[[Summer of Love]]." While the song had originally been written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] to promote the June 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], it became an instant hit worldwide (#4 in the United States, #1 in Europe) and quickly transcended its original purpose.

San Francisco's [[flower children]], also called "hippies" by local newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], adopted new styles of dress, experimented with [[psychedelic drug]]s, lived communally and developed a vibrant music scene. When people returned home from "The Summer of Love" these styles and behaviors spread quickly from San Francisco and Berkeley to many US and Canadian cities and European capitals. Some hippies formed communes to live as far outside of the established system as possible. This aspect of the counterculture rejected active political engagement with the mainstream and, following the dictate of Timothy Leary to "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]", hoped to change society by [[dropping out]] of it. Looking back on his own life (as a Harvard professor) prior to 1960, Leary interpreted it to have been that of "an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis&amp;nbsp; ... like several million [[middle-class]], liberal, intellectual robots."

As members of the hippie movement grew older and moderated their lives and their views, and especially after US involvement in the Vietnam War ended in the mid-1970s, the counterculture was largely absorbed by the mainstream, leaving a lasting impact on philosophy, morality, music, art, alternative health and diet, lifestyle and fashion.

In addition to a new style of clothing, philosophy, art, music and various views on anti-war, and anti-establishment, some hippies decided to turn away from modern society and re-settle on ranches, or communes. The very first of communes in the United States was a seven-acre land in Southern Colorado, named [[Drop City]]. According to Timothy Miller, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Drop City brought together most of the themes that had been developing in other recent communities-anarchy, pacifism, sexual freedom, rural isolation, interest in drugs, art-and wrapped them flamboyantly into a commune not quite like any that had gone before&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, M. (2010) Droppers: America's First Hippie Commune, Drop City. University of Oklahoma Press. p56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the inhabitants practiced acts like reusing trash and recycled materials to build Geodesic domes for shelter and other various purposes; using various drugs like marijuana and LSD, and creating various pieces of [[Drop Art]]. After the initial success of Drop City, visitors would take the idea of communes and spread them. Another commune called "The Ranch" was very similar to the culture of Drop City, as well as new concepts like giving children of the commune extensive freedoms known as "children's rights".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, B. (1981). The Survival of a Counterculture: Ideological work and everyday life among rural communards. University of California Press. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana, LSD, and other recreational drugs===
{{See also|History of LSD}}
{{Psychedelic sidebar|Culture}}
{{Cannabis sidebar|Arts and Culture}}

During the 1960s, this second group of casual [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) users evolved and expanded into a [[subculture]] that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising [[consciousness]]. The personalities associated with the subculture, gurus such as Timothy Leary and [[psychedelic rock]] musicians such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Pink Floyd]], Jimi Hendrix, [[The Byrds]], [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], [[Ultimate Spinach]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]], [[The Doors]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and the Beatles, soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.

The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as [[Ken Kesey]] participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of these early days of LSD's entrance into the non-academic world in his book ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', which documented the cross-country, acid-fueled voyage of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus "Furthur" and the Pranksters' later "Acid Test" LSD parties. In 1965, [[Sandoz]] laboratories stopped its still legal shipments of LSD to the United States for research and psychiatric use, after a request from the US government concerned about its use. By April 1966, LSD use had become so widespread that ''[[Time Magazine]]'' warned about its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899158,00.html |title=Drugs: The Dangers of LSD |publisher=TIME |date=April 22, 1966 |accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1966, the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Hallucination Generation]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|60488|Hallucination Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' in 1967 and ''[[Psych-Out]]'' in 1968.

====Psychedelic research and experimentation====
As most research on psychedelics began in the 1940s and 50s, heavy experimentation made its effect in the 1960s during this era of change and movement. Researchers were gaining acknowledgment and popularity with their promotion of psychedelia. This really anchored the change that counterculture instigators and followers began. Most research was conducted at top collegiate institutes, such as [[Harvard University]].

[[Timothy Leary]] and his Harvard research team had hopes for potential changes in society. Their research began with [[psilocybin]] mushrooms and was called the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. In one study known as the [[Concord Prison Experiment]], Leary investigated the potential for psilocybin to reduce [[recidivism]] in criminals being released from prison. After the research sessions, Leary did a follow-up. He found that "75% of the turned on prisoners who were released had stayed out of jail."&lt;ref name="Lattin"&gt;Lattin, Don. The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America. New York: HarperOne, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed he had solved the nation's crime problem. But with many officials skeptical, this breakthrough was not promoted.

Because of the personal experiences with these drugs Leary and his many outstanding colleagues, [[Aldous Huxley]] (''[[The Doors of Perception]]'') and [[Alan Watts]] (''The Joyous Cosmology'') believed that these were the mechanisms that could bring peace to not only the nation but the world. As their research continued the media followed them and published their work and documented their behavior, the trend of this counterculture drug experimentation began.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy. Flashbacks: An Autobiography. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary made attempts to bring more organized awareness to people interested in the study of psychedelics. He confronted the Senate committee in Washington and recommended for colleges to authorize the conduction of laboratory courses in psychedelics. He noted that these courses would "end the indiscriminate use of LSD and would be the most popular and productive courses ever offered".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Warren R., and Joseph R. Hixson. LSD on Campus. New York: [[Dell Pub.]], 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these men were seeking an ultimate enlightenment, reality eventually proved that the potential they thought was there could not be reached, at least in this time. The change they sought for the world had not been permitted by the political systems of all the nations these men pursued their research in. Ram Dass states, "Tim and I actually had a chart on the wall about how soon everyone would be enlightened ... We found out that real change is harder. We downplayed the fact that the psychedelic experience isn't for everyone."&lt;ref name="Lattin"/&gt;

Leary and his team's research got shut down at Harvard and everywhere they relocated around the globe. Their outlawish behavior and aggressive approach with these drugs did not settle well with the law. Officials did not agree with this chaotic promotion of peace.

Research with [[psychedelic drug]]s and those who conducted it was a radical understanding for the vast majority of the world. However, it did create a change. A ripple of curiosity was created as a result and the wave is continuing to swell.

====Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters====
Ken Kesey and his [[Merry Pranksters]] helped shape the developing character of the 1960s counterculture when they embarked on a cross-country voyage during the summer of 1964 in a psychedelic school bus named "Furthur". Beginning in 1959, Kesey had volunteered as a research subject for medical trials financed by the CIA's ''[[Project MKULTRA|MK ULTRA]]'' project. These trials tested the effects of LSD, psilocybin, [[mescaline]], and other psychedelic drugs. After the medical trials, Kesey continued experimenting on his own, and involved many close friends; collectively they became known as "The Merry Pranksters". The Pranksters visited Harvard LSD proponent Timothy Leary at his [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]], New York retreat, and experimentation with LSD and other psychedelic drugs, primarily as a means for internal reflection and personal growth, became a constant during the Prankster trip.

The Pranksters created a direct link between the 1950s [[Beat Generation]] and the 1960s psychedelic scene; the bus was driven by Beat icon [[Neal Cassady]], Beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] was on board for a time, and they dropped in on Cassady's friend, Beat author [[Jack Kerouac]] - though Kerouac declined to participate in the Prankster scene. After the Pranksters returned to California, they popularized the use of LSD at so-called "[[Acid Tests]]", which initially were held at Kesey's home in [[La Honda, California]], and then at many other West Coast venues. The cross country trip and Prankster experiments were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', a masterpiece of [[New Journalism]].

====Other psychedelics====
Experimentation with LSD, [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and other psychedelic drugs became a major component of 1960s counterculture, influencing philosophy, [[Psychedelic art|art]], music and styles of dress. Jim DeRogatis wrote that peyote, a small cactus containing the psychedelic alkaloid mescaline, was widely available in [[Austin, Texas]], a countercultural hub in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;J. DeRogatis, Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), {{ISBN|0-634-05548-8}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual revolution===
{{Main|Sexual revolution}}
The sexual revolution (also known as a time of "sexual liberation") was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[Western world]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;{{harvnb|Allyn|2000}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Escoffier|2003}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control|Contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], the normalization of [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]] and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative media===
{{Main|Alternative media}}

[[Underground newspapers]] sprang up in most cities and college towns, serving to define and communicate the range of phenomena that defined the counterculture: radical political opposition to "[[The Establishment]]", colorful experimental (and often explicitly drug-influenced) approaches to art, music and cinema, and uninhibited indulgence in sex and drugs as a symbol of freedom. The papers also often included comic strips, from which the [[underground comix]] were an outgrowth.

As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. The forms of escape and resistance manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].

===Avant-garde art and anti-art===
{{See also|Happening}}

The [[Situationist International]] was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in [[Marxism]] and the 20th-century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the ''construction of situations'', namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and [[advertising]] have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. [[Raoul Vaneigem]] wrote ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' which takes the field of "[[everyday life]]" as the ground upon which communication and participation can occur, or, as is more commonly the case, be perverted and abstracted into pseudo-forms.

[[Fluxus]] (a name taken from a [[Latin]] word meaning "to flow") is an international network of artists, composers and designers noted for blending different artistic media and disciplines in the 1960s. They have been active in [[Neo-Dada]] [[noise music]], [[visual art]], literature, [[urban planning]], architecture, and design. Fluxus is often described as [[intermedia]], a term coined by Fluxus artist [[Dick Higgins]] in a famous 1966 essay. Fluxus encouraged a "[[do-it-yourself]]" aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]] wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth."&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|978-0-948518-88-1}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; After, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] grew out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts. [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] (often referred to as simply "the Motherfuckers", or UAW/MF) was an [[anarchist]] [[affinity group]] based in [[New York City]].

During the early 1960s, [[British Invasion|Britain's new wave of musicians gained popularity and fame in the United States]].

The music of the 1960s moved towards an electric, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] version of rock, thanks largely to Bob Dylan's decision to play an electric guitar at the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32}}&lt;ref name="Sounes"&gt;H. Sounes, 2002, p. 218{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly popularized electric sound of rock was then built upon and molded into [[psychedelic rock]] by artists like [[The 13th Floor Elevators]]&lt;ref&gt;M.

Derogatis, 1996, p. 19{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pet Sounds'' served as a major source of inspiration for other contemporary acts, most notably directly inspiring the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. The single "[[Good Vibrations]]" soared to number one globally, completely changing the perception of what a record could be.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 37}} It was during this period that the highly anticipated album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' was to be released. However, the project collapsed and The Beach Boys released a downgraded version called ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', which failed to make a big commercial impact but was also highly influential, most notably on [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]].

The Beatles went on to become the most prominent commercial exponents of the "psychedelic revolution" (e.g., ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'') in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=1) Sgt.

These included [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] (''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]''), [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''), Jimi Hendrix (''[[Are You Experienced]]''), [[Jefferson Airplane]] (''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]''), [[The Doors]] (''[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]'') and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] (''[[Stand!]]'').

Longhurst, 1995, p. 108{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that put more emphasis on [[avant-garde]] and art music. Bands such as [[The Velvet Underground]] came out of this underground music scene, which was predominantly centered at [[Andy Warhol]]'s legendary [[The Factory|Factory]]. The Velvet Underground supplied the music for the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]], a series of [[multimedia]] events staged by Warhol and his collaborators in 1966 and 1967. The Velvet Underground's lyrics were considered risqué for the era, since they discussed [[sexual fetishism]], [[transgender]] identities, and the use of [[hard drugs]] associated with Warhol's Factory and its [[Warhol superstars|superstars]].&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 44{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit's [[MC5]] also came out of the underground rock music scene of the late 1960s. They introduced a more aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with sociopolitical and countercultural lyrics of the era, such as in the song "Motor City Is Burning" (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit Race Riot]] of 1943 to the Detroit riot of 1967).

Another hotbed of the 1960s counterculture was [[Austin, Texas]], with two of the era's legendary music venues-the [[Vulcan Gas Company]] and the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]-and musical talent like [[Janis Joplin]], the [[13th Floor Elevators]], [[Shiva's Headband]], the Conqueroo, and, later, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Austin was also home to a large New Left activist movement, one of the earliest underground papers, [[The Rag]], and cutting edge graphic artists like [[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers|Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]] creator [[Gilbert Shelton]], underground comix pioneer [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]] (Jaxon), and surrealist armadillo artist [[Jim Franklin (artist)|Jim Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim DeRogatis]], ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), {{ISBN|0-634-05548-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s was also an era of [[rock festival]]s, which played an important role in spreading the counterculture across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mankin |first=Bill |url=http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ |title=We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America |work=Like the Dew: A Journal of Southern Culture and Politics |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which launched Hendrix's career in the US, was one of the first of these festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 95{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's 1968–1970 [[Isle of Wight Festival]]s drew big names such as [[The Who]], [[The Doors]], [[Joni Mitchell]], Hendrix, Dylan, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2002, p. 296{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in New York state became a symbol of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|title=3 Days of Peace and Music, 40 Years Later|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19love.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival drew a larger crowd.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;{{rp|58}} Some believe the era came to an abrupt end with the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]] held by [[The Rolling Stones]], in which heavy-handed security from the [[Hells Angels]] resulted in the stabbing of an audience member, apparently in self-defense, as the show descended into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 305{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Doors in Copenhagen 1968.jpg|thumb|[[The Doors]] performing for [[Television in Denmark|Danish television]] in 1968]]
As the psychedelic revolution progressed, lyrics grew more complex, (such as [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]"&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 297{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Long-playing albums enabled artists to make more in-depth statements than could be made in just a single song (such as the [[Mothers of Invention]]'s satirical ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1997, p. 317{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even the rules governing single songs were stretched, and singles lasting longer than three minutes emerged, such as Dylan's "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s "[[Alice's Restaurant]]", and [[Iron Butterfly]]'s 17-minute-long "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]].".&lt;ref name="Sounes" /&gt;

The 1960s saw the protest song gain a sense of political self-importance, with Phil Ochs's "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]" and Country Joe and the Fish's "[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die-Rag]]" among the many anti-war anthems that were important to the era.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;

[[Free jazz]] is an approach to [[jazz]] music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Although the music produced by free jazz composers varied widely, the common feature was a dissatisfaction with the limitations of [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]], which had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Each in their own way, free jazz musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down the conventions of jazz, often by discarding hitherto invariable features of jazz, such as fixed [[chord change]]s or [[tempo]]s. While usually considered experimental and avant-garde, free jazz has also oppositely been conceived as an attempt to return jazz to its "primitive", often religious roots, and emphasis on collective improvisation. Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Cecil Taylor]] and the later works of saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]. Other important pioneers included [[Charles Mingus]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]], [[Joe Maneri]] and [[Sun Ra]]. Although today "free jazz" is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including "avant-garde", "energy music" and "The New Thing". During its early and mid-60s heyday, much free jazz was released by established labels such as Prestige, Blue Note and Impulse, as well as independents such as [[ESP Disk]] and BYG Actuel. [[Free improvisation]] or ''free music'' is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the logic or inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable genre in its own right. [[Free improvisation]], as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of [[free jazz]] and [[contemporary music|modern classical]] musics. None of its primary exponents can be said to be famous within mainstream; however, in experimental circles, a number of free musicians are well known, including saxophonists [[Evan Parker]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Peter Brötzmann]] and [[John Zorn]], drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], guitarists [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Fred Frith]] and the improvising groups The [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] and [[AMM (group)|AMM]].

[[Allmusic Guide]] states that "until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, "[[jazz-rock]]" (or "jazz/rock") is often used as a synonym for the term "[[Fusion jazz|jazz fusion]]". However, some make a distinction between the two terms. [[The Free Spirits]] have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz-rock band.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unterberger1998|Unterberger 1998]], pg. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s, at the same time that jazz musicians were experimenting with rock rhythms and electric instruments, rock groups such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] were "beginning to incorporate elements of jazz into their music" by "experimenting with extended free-form improvisation". Other "groups such as [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]] directly borrowed harmonic, melodic, rhythmic and instrumentational elements from the jazz tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liraproductions.com/jazzrock/htdocs/histhome.htm The Jazz/Rock Fusion Page:a site is dedicated to Jazz Fusion and related genres with a special emphasis on Jazz/Rock fusion]&lt;/ref&gt; The rock groups that drew on jazz ideas (like [[Soft Machine]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] and [[Frank Zappa]]) turned the blend of the two styles with electric instruments.&lt;ref name="tesser"&gt;N. Tesser, ''The Playboy Guide to Jazz'', (Plume, 1998), {{ISBN|0452276489}}, P. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late 1960s and early 70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer-songwriter movement."&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2776|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles Davis]]' ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' sessions, recorded in August 1969 and released the following year, mostly abandoned jazz's usual swing beat in favor of a [[rock music|rock]]-style [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] anchored by [[electric bass]] grooves. The recording "... mixed free jazz blowing by a large ensemble with electronic keyboards and guitar, plus a dense mix of percussion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm Jazzitude &amp;#124; History of Jazz Part 8: Fusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114032732/http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm |date=January 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis also drew on the rock influence by playing his trumpet through electronic effects and pedals. While the album gave Davis a [[gold record]], the use of electric instruments and rock beats created a great deal of consternation amongst some more conservative jazz critics.

{{Main|1960s in film}}
The counterculture was not only affected by cinema, but was also instrumental in the provision of era-relevant content and talent for the film industry. ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' struck a chord with the youth as "the alienation of the young in the 1960s was comparable to the director's image of the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Jackson and J. E. O'Connor, 1980, P237&lt;/ref&gt; Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media.

In France the [[french new wave|New Wave]] was a [[blanket term]] coined by critics for a group of [[Cinema of France|French filmmakers]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, influenced by [[Italian Neorealism]] and [[classical Hollywood cinema]]. Although never a formally organized movement, the New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful [[iconoclasm]] and is an example of [[European art cinema]]. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. The Left Bank, or ''Rive Gauche'', group is a contingent of filmmakers associated with the French New Wave, first identified as such by [[Richard Roud]].&lt;ref name=hfa&gt;"The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda", ''Harvard Film Archive'', [http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907190306/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html |date=September 7, 2015 }} Access date: August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding "right bank" group is constituted of the more famous and financially successful New Wave directors associated with ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' ([[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]).&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Left Bank directors include [[Chris Marker]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Agnès Varda]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Roud described a distinctive "fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making", as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Other film "new waves" from around the world associated with the 1960s are [[New German Cinema]], [[Czechoslovak New Wave]], Brazilian [[Cinema Novo]] and [[Japanese New Wave]]. During the 1960s, the term "[[art film]]" began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly, to include foreign-language (non-English) [[auteur theory|"auteur"]] films, [[independent film]]s, [[experimental film]]s, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s  "art film" became a euphemism in the U.S. for racy Italian and French [[B-movies]]. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe [[pornography|sexually explicit]] European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]''. The 1960s was an important period in art film; the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the [[European art cinema]] which had countercultural traits in filmmakers such as [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].

Cultural historians–such as [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] in his 1986 essay "From Satori to Silicon Valley" and John Markoff in his book ''[[What the Dormouse Said]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html "From Satori to Silicon Valley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070447/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html |date=June 8, 2011 }} - Roszak, Stanford&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out that many of the early pioneers of [[personal computing]] emerged from within the West Coast counterculture. Many early computing and networking pioneers, after discovering [[LSD]] and roaming the campuses of UC Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT in the late 1960s and early 1970s, would emerge from this caste of social "misfits" to shape the modern world of technology, especially in [[Silicon Valley]].

===Religion, spirituality and the occult===

Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. If they adhered to mainstream faiths, hippies were likely to embrace [[Buddhism]], [[Daoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]] and the [[restorationist]] Christianity of the [[Jesus Movement]]. Some hippies embraced [[neo-paganism]], especially [[Wicca]]. Wicca is a witchcraft religion which became more prominent beginning in 1951, with the repeal of the [[1735 Witchcraft Act|Witchcraft Act of 1735]], after which [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and then others such as [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Cecil Williamson]] began publicising their own versions of the Craft. Gardner and others never used the term "Wicca" as a religious identifier, simply referring to the "witch cult", "witchcraft", and the "Old Religion". However, Gardner did refer to witches as "the Wica".&lt;ref name="WitchcraftToday"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald B |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) |title=Witchcraft Today |publisher=Mercury Publishing |location=Lake Toxaway, NC |year=1999 |origyear=1954 |oclc=44936549 |isbn=978-0-8065-2593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the name of the religion normalised to "Wicca".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=vii}}&lt;ref name="Seims 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica_or_wicca.htm |title=Wica or Wicca? – Politics and the Power of Words |journal=The Cauldron |first=Melissa |last=Seims |issue=129 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's tradition, later termed [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerianism]], soon became the dominant form in [[England]] and spread to other parts of the [[British Isles]]. Following Gardner's death in 1964, the Craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in British tabloids, with new traditions being propagated by figures like [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], [[Sybil Leek]] and most importantly [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], whose [[Alexandrian Wicca]], which was predominantly based upon Gardnerian Wicca, albeit with an emphasis placed on [[ceremonial magic]], spread quickly and gained much media attention.

In his 1991 book, ''Hippies and American Values'', Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a "religious movement" whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. "Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7F31yYxOMAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;q=hippie%20as%20a%20religious%20movements |first=Timothy|last= Miller|title=Hippies and American Values |publisher=Univ Tennessee Press; 1st edition|accessdate=October 11, 2013|isbn=9780870496943|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal, contemporaneous work, ''The Hippie Trip'', author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called "high priests" who emerged during that era.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hippie Trip'', Lewis Yablonsky, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

One such hippie "high priest" was San Francisco State College instructor [[Stephen Gaskin]]. Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's "Monday Night Class" eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings. In 1970, Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]], and he still lists his religion as "Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |title=Communal Religions |publisher=Thefarm.org |date=October 6, 1966 |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511184303/http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/12/new_book_tells_inside_story_of_biggest_hippie_comm.php |title=New Book Tells Inside Story Of Biggest Hippie Commune In U.S. - Toke of the Town - cannabis news, views, rumor and humor |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stephen Gaskin |isbn=9781570671814 |title=Monday Night Class |publisher=Amazon.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Leary was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents based on a "freedom of religion" argument.

It was originally published under the title "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The title, literally meaning "Discordant Principles", is in keeping with the tendency of [[Latin]] to prefer hypotactic grammatical arrangements. In English, one would expect the title to be "Principles of Discord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and legacy==
The lasting impact, including unintended consequences, creative output and general legacy of the counterculture era continue to be actively discussed, debated, despised and celebrated.

Even the notions of when the counterculture subsumed the Beat Generation, when it gave way to the successor generation, and what happened in between are open for debate. According to notable UK Underground and counterculture author Barry Miles, "It seemed to me that the Seventies was when most of the things that people attribute to the sixties really happened: this was the age of extremes, people took more drugs, had longer hair, weirder clothes, had more sex, protested more violently and encountered more opposition from the establishment. It was the era of sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, as [[Ian Dury]] said. The countercultural explosion of the 1960s really only involved a few thousand people in the UK and perhaps ten times that in the USA – largely because of opposition to the Vietnam war, whereas in the Seventies the ideas had spread out across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=In the Seventies: Adventures in the Counterculture (Comments from the Author's Website)|url=http://barrymiles.co.uk/all-books/in-the-seventies/|website=barrymiles.co.uk|publisher=Barry Miles|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Columbia University teaching unit on the counterculture era notes: "Although historians disagree over the influence of the counterculture on American politics and society, most describe the counterculture in similar terms. Virtually all authors—for example, on the right, [[Robert Bork]] in [[Slouching Towards Gomorrah|''Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline'']] (New York: Regan Books,1996) and, on the left, [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1987)—characterize the counterculture as self-indulgent, childish, irrational, narcissistic, and even dangerous. Even so, many liberal and leftist historians find constructive elements in it, while those on the right tend not to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235327/http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-28 |title=The Legacy of the Counterculture |last1=George |first1=Jason |date=2004 |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen legend [[John Wayne]] equated aspects of 1960s social programs with the rise of the [[welfare state]], "... I know all about that. In the late Twenties, when I was a sophomore at USC, I was a socialist myself—but not when I left. The average college kid idealistically wishes everybody could have ice cream and cake for every meal. But as he gets older and gives more thought to his and his fellow man's responsibilities, he finds that it can't work out that way—that some people just won't carry their load ... I believe in welfare—a welfare work program. I don't think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I'd like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I'd like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters. I can't understand these people who carry placards to save the life of some criminal, yet have no thought for the innocent victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Randy |last2=Olsen |first2=James Stuart |date=1997 |title=John Wayne:America |page=580 |isbn=978-0803289703 | publisher=Bison Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former liberal Democrat [[Ronald Reagan]], who later became a conservative Governor of California and 40th President of the US, remarked about one group of protesters carrying signs, "The last bunch of pickets were carrying signs that said 'Make love, not war.'

The "generation gap" between the affluent young and their often poverty-scarred parents was a critical component of 1960s culture. In an interview with journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] during the 1968 US presidential campaign, soon-to-be First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] exposed the generational chasm in worldview between Steinem, 20 years her junior, and herself after Steinem probed Mrs. Nixon as to her youth, role models, and lifestyle. A hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, Pat Nixon told Steinem, "I never had time to think about things like that, who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do ... I've kept working. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I never had it easy. I'm not at all like you ... all those people who had it easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halberstam|first1=David|title=The Fifties|date=1993|publisher=Random House/Villard|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-41559-6|page=324|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economic terms, it has been contended that the counterculture really only amounted to creating new marketing segments for the "hip" crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/4027702 |title=The selling of the counterculture (Book Review: The Rebel Sell) |date=May 6, 2005 |website=economist.com |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the counterculture movement reached its peak of influence, the concept of the adoption of socially-responsible policies by establishment corporations was discussed by economist and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] (1962): "Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine. If businessmen do have a social responsibility other than making maximum profits for stockholders, how are they to know what it is? Can self-selected private individuals decide what the social interest is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silk|first1=Leonard|last2=Silk|first2=Mark|title=The American Establishment|date=1980|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00134-7|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, commentator [[Peter Hitchens]] identified the counterculture as one of the contributing factors to what he saw as the malaise in British politics in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hitchens, Peter|title=The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84706-405-9|title-link=The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way }} - see conclusion, 'The Broken Compass'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, author and former Free Speech activist [[Greil Marcus]] was quoted, "What happened four decades ago is history. It's not just a blip in the history of trends. Whoever shows up at a march against war in Iraq, it always takes place with a memory of the efficacy and joy and gratification of similar protests that took place in years before ... It doesn't matter that there is no counterculture, because counterculture of the past gives people a sense that their own difference matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/style/a-movement-yes-but-no-counterculture.html? |title=A Movement, Yes, but No Counterculture

When asked about the prospects of the counterculture movement moving forward in the digital age, former Grateful Dead lyricist and self-styled "cyberlibertarian" [[John Perry Barlow]] said, "I started out as a teenage beatnik and then became a hippie and then became a cyberpunk. And now I'm still a member of the counterculture, but I don't know what to call that. And I'd been inclined to think that that was a good thing, because once the counterculture in America gets a name then the media can coopt it, and the advertising industry can turn it into a marketing foil. But you know, right now I'm not sure that it is a good thing, because we don't have any flag to rally around. Without a name there may be no coherent movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utne.com/community/cognitivedissidentjohnperrybarlow.aspx#axzz32SGxVXXx |title=Cognitive Dissident: John Perry Barlow

During the era, conservative students objected to the counterculture and found ways to celebrate their conservative ideals by reading books like [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s ''A Study of Communism'', joining student organizations like the [[College Republicans]], and organizing [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek events]] which reinforced gender norms.&lt;ref name="rollandiamondanotherside"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolland-Diamond|first1=Caroline|title=Another Side of the Sixties: Festive Practices on College Campuses and the Making of a Conservative Youth Movement|journal=Revue Française d'Études Américaines|date=2016|volume=1|issue=146|pages=39–53|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=RFEA_146_0039&amp;WT.mc_id=RFEA_146|accessdate=October 24, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free Speech advocate and social anthropologist  Jentri Anders observed that a number of freedoms were endorsed within a countercultural community in which she lived and studied: "freedom to explore one's potential, freedom to create one's Self, freedom of personal expression, freedom from scheduling, freedom from rigidly defined roles and hierarchical statuses ..." Additionally, Anders believed some in the counterculture wished to modify children's education so that it didn't discourage, but rather encouraged, "aesthetic sense, love of nature, passion for music, desire for reflection, or strongly marked independence."&lt;ref&gt;Jentri Anders, Beyond Counterculture, Washington State University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitchell, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Merry Prankster [[Carolyn Adams|Carolyn "Mountain Girl" Garcia]] commented, "I see remnants of that movement everywhere. It's sort of like the nuts in Ben and Jerry's ice cream -- it's so thoroughly mixed in, we sort of expect it. The nice thing is that eccentricity is no longer so foreign. We've embraced diversity in a lot of ways in this country. I do think it's done us a tremendous service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/SUMMER-OF-LOVE-40-YEARS-LATER-Just-a-season-2559193.php#photo-2702198 |title=SUMMER OF LOVE: 40 YEARS LATER

In [[computer science]] and [[logic]], a '''dependent type''' is a type whose definition depends on a value. A "pair of integers" is a type. A "pair of integers where the second is greater than the first" is a dependent type because of the dependence on the value. It is an overlapping feature of [[type theory]] and [[type system]]s.  In [[intuitionistic type theory]], dependent types are used to encode logic's [[Generalized quantifier|quantifiers]] like "for all" and "there exists". In [[functional programming languages]] like [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Coq]], [[F*_(programming_language) | F*]] , [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], and [[Shen (programming language)|Shen]], dependent types prevent bugs by allowing extremely expressive types.

Two common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs.  A dependent function's return type may depend on the ''value'' (not just type) of an argument.  A function that takes a positive integer "n" may return an array of length "n".  (Note that this is different from [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] and [[generic programming]], both of which include the type as an argument.)  A dependent pair may have a second value that depends on the first.  It can be used to encode a pair of integers where the second one is greater than the first.

Dependent types add complexity to a type system.  Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence [[type checking]] may become [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].

==History==

Dependent types were created to deepen the connection between programming and logic.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In 1934, [[Haskell Curry]] noticed that the types used in [[typed lambda calculus]], and in its [[combinatory logic]] counterpart, followed the same pattern as axioms in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]].  Going further, for every proof in the logic, there was a matching function (term) in the programming language.  One of Curry's examples was the correspondence between [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name=curry_howard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Morten Heine B.|author2=Pawel Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism|year=1998|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.17.7385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predicate logic]] is an extension of propositional logic, adding quantifiers. [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] and [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|de Bruijn]] extended lambda calculus to match this more powerful logic by creating types for dependent functions, which correspond to "for all", and dependent pairs, which correspond to "there exists".&lt;ref name=dep_types_at_work&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bove|first=Ana|author2=Peter Dybjer|title=Dependent Types at Work|year=2008|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/DependentTypesAtWork.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Because of this and other work by Howard, propositions-as-types is known as the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].)

==Formal definition==
===&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; type===
Loosely speaking, dependent types are similar to the type of an indexed family of sets. More formally, given a type &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; in a universe of types &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, one may have a '''family of types''' &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, which assigns to each term &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt; a type &lt;math&gt;B(a):\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. We say that the type ''B(a)'' varies with ''a''.

A function whose type of return value varies with its argument (i.e. there is no fixed [[codomain]]) is a '''dependent function''' and the type of this function is called '''dependent product type''', '''pi-type''' or '''dependent function type'''&lt;ref name='without-sugar'/&gt;.  For this example, the dependent function type is typically written as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\prod_{x:A} B(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math display="block"&gt;\prod\nolimits_{x:A} B(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function, the corresponding dependent product type is equivalent to an ordinary [[function type]]. That is, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{x:A}B&lt;/math&gt; is judgmentally equal to &lt;math&gt;A\to B&lt;/math&gt; when ''B'' does not depend on ''x''.

The name 'pi-type' comes from the idea that these may be viewed as a [[Cartesian product]] of types. Pi-types can also be understood as [[model theory|models]] of [[Universal quantification#As adjoint|universal quantifiers]].

For example, if we write &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vec}(\mathbb{R},n)&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''-tuples of [[real numbers]], then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} \operatorname{Vec}(\mathbb{R},n)&lt;/math&gt; would be the type of a function which, given a [[natural number]] ''n'', returns a tuple of real numbers of size ''n''. The usual function space arises as a special case when the range type does not actually depend on the input. E.g. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} {\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of functions from natural numbers to the real numbers, which is written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; in typed lambda calculus.

===&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; type===
The [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of the dependent product type is the '''dependent pair type''', '''dependent sum type''', '''sigma-type''', or (confusingly) '''dependent product type'''&lt;ref name='without-sugar'/&gt;. Sigma-types can also be understood as [[Universal quantification#As adjoint|existential quantifiers]]. Continuing the above example, if, in the universe of types &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a type &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and a family of types &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a dependent pair type &lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{x:A} B(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The dependent pair type captures the idea of an ordered pair where the type of the second term is dependent on the value of the first. If &lt;math display="block"&gt;(a,b):\sum_{x:A} B(x),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b:B(a)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''B'' is a constant function, then the dependent pair type becomes (is judgementally equal to) the [[product type]], that is, an ordinary Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;A\times B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref follow='without-sugar'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztxa/publ/pisigma-new.pdf| title=ΠΣ: Dependent Types without the Sugar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example as existential quantification====
Let &lt;math&gt;A:\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; be some type, and let &lt;math&gt;B:A\to\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], ''B'' can be interpreted as a logical [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] on terms of ''A''. For a given &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt;, whether the type ''B(a)'' is inhabited indicates whether ''a'' satisfies this predicate. The correspondence can be extended to existential quantification and dependent pairs: the proposition &lt;math&gt;\exists{a}{\in}A\,B(a)&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]] the type &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{a:A}B(a)&lt;/math&gt; is inhabited.

For example, &lt;math&gt;m:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;n:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists another natural number &lt;math&gt;k:\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''. In logic, this statement is codified by existential quantification: &lt;math display="block"&gt;m\le n \iff \exists{k}{\in}\mathbb{N}\,m+k=n.&lt;/math&gt; This proposition corresponds to the dependent pair type: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{k:\mathbb{N}} m+k=n.&lt;/math&gt; That is, a proof of the statement that ''m'' is less than ''n'' is a pair that contains both a number ''k'', which is the difference between ''m'' and ''n'', and a proof of the equality ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''.

==Systems of the lambda cube==
[[Henk Barendregt]] developed the [[lambda cube]] as a means of classifying type systems along three axes.  The eight corners of the resulting cube-shaped diagram each correspond to a type system, with [[simply typed lambda calculus]] in the least expressive corner, and [[calculus of constructions]] in the most expressive.  The three axes of the cube correspond to three different augmentations of the simply typed lambda calculus: the addition of dependent types, the addition of polymorphism, and the addition of higher [[kind (type theory)|kinded]] type constructors (functions from types to types, for example).  The lambda cube is generalized further by [[pure type system]]s.

===First order dependent type theory===
The system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi&lt;/math&gt; of pure first order dependent types, corresponding to the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]], is obtained by generalising the function space type of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to the dependent product type.

===Second order dependent type theory===
The system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi 2&lt;/math&gt; of second order dependent types is obtained from &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi&lt;/math&gt; by allowing quantification over type constructors. In this theory the dependent product operator subsumes both the &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; operator of simply typed lambda calculus and the &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; binder of [[System F]].

===Higher order dependently typed polymorphic lambda calculus===
The higher order system &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi \omega&lt;/math&gt; extends &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Pi 2&lt;/math&gt; to all four forms of abstraction from the [[lambda cube]]: functions from terms to terms, types to types, terms to types and types to terms. The system corresponds to the [[calculus of constructions]] whose derivative, the [[calculus of inductive constructions]] is the underlying system of [[Coq|the Coq proof assistant]].

== Simultaneous programming language and logic ==

The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] implies that types can be constructed that express arbitrarily complex mathematical properties.  If the user can supply a [[constructive proof]] that a type is ''inhabited'' (i.e., that a value of that type exists) then a compiler can check the proof and convert it into executable computer code that computes the value by carrying out the construction.  The proof checking feature makes dependently typed languages closely related to [[proof assistant]]s.  The code-generation aspect provides a powerful approach to formal [[program verification]] and [[proof-carrying code]], since the code is derived directly from a mechanically verified mathematical proof.

It is related to, or also known as, '''financial abuse,''' which is the illegal or unauthorized use of a person’s property, money, pension book or other valuables (including changing the person's [[will (law)|will]] to name the abuser as heir), often fraudulently obtaining [[power of attorney]], followed by deprivation of money or other property, or by eviction from own home. Financial abuse applies to both [[elder abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnot|first=Edward J.|title=Is Your Parent in Good Hands?: Protecting Your Aging Parent from Financial Abuse and Neglect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOFrtWIKrncC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2004|publisher=Capital Books|isbn=978-1-931868-37-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinction between economic abuse and financial abuse is that economic abuse also includes the control of someone's present or future earning potential by preventing them from obtaining a job or education.

==Role in domestic violence==
Economic abuse in a domestic situation may involve:
* preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, such as restricting their ability to find employment, maintain or advance their careers, and acquire assets
* preventing the victim from obtaining education
* spend victim's money without his or her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available resources
* exploiting economic resources of the victim&lt;ref name="Adams (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brewster |first=M. P. |title=Power and Control Dynamics in Pre-stalking and Stalking Situations |journal=Journal of Family Violence |year=2003 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1023/A:1024064214054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders (2004)"/&gt;

In its extreme (and usual) form, this involves putting the [[Victimisation|victim]] on a strict "allowance", withholding money at will and forcing the victim to beg for the money until the abuser gives the victim some money. It is common for the victim to receive less and less money as the abuse continues. This also includes (but is not limited to) preventing the victim from finishing [[education]] or obtaining [[employment]], or intentionally squandering or misusing communal resources.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Abuse". BSAFE. September 6, 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlling mechanism===
Economic abuse is often used as a [[Abusive power and control|controlling mechanism]] as part of a larger pattern of domestic abuse, which may include [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may include threats or attempts to kill the spouse. By restricting the victim's access to economic resources, the offender has limited recourses to exit the abusive or violent relationship.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel'']. Women's Domestic Abuse Helpline.  Retrieved December 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are ways that abusers may use economic abuse with other forms of domestic violence:
* Using physical force, or threat of violence, to get money.
* Providing money for sexual activity.
* Controlling access to a telephone, vehicle or ability to go shopping; other forms of [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]].
* Threatening to evict the spouse and children from the house without financial support.
* Exploiting the victim's economic disadvantage.
* Destroying or taking resources from the spouse and/or children.
* [[Blaming the victim]] for an inability to manage money; or instigating other forms of economic abuse, such as destruction of property.&lt;ref name=wdachoices/&gt;

[[Victimization]] occurs across all socio-economic levels, and when victims are asked why they stay in abusive relationships, "lack of income" is a common response.&lt;ref name=ncadv&gt;[http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf ''Economic Abuse.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228000000/http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf |date=February 28, 2013 }} National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job-related impacts===
There are several ways that abusers may impact a victim's economic resources.  As mentioned earlier, the abuser may prevent the victim from working or make it very difficult to maintain a job.  They may likewise impede their ability to obtain an education.  Frequent phone calls, surprise visits and other harassing activities interfere with the spouse's work performance. In couples in which the spouse is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning of their sexuality ([[LGBTQ]]), the abuser may threaten to "out them" with their employer.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

The [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] in the [[United States]] reports that:
* 25% – 50% of victims of abuse from a partner have lost their job due to domestic violence.
* 35% – 56% of victims of domestic violence are harassed at work by their partners.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Impact of lack of economic resources===
By denying the victim access to money, such as forbidding the victim from maintaining a bank account, he or she is totally financially dependent upon the abuser for shelter, food, clothing and other necessities.  In some cases the abuser may withhold those necessities, also including medicine and personal hygiene products. They may also greatly limit their ability to leave the abusive situation by refusing to pay court-ordered spousal or child support.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

Abusers may also use force their spouses to obtain credit and then through negligent activities ruin their credit rating and ability to get credit.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Managing economic abuse===
There are several ways to manage economic abuse: ensure one has safe access to important personal and financial records, ensure one's research activities are not traceable and, if you believe you are going to leave the relationship, prepare ahead of time.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Role in elder abuse==
{{main article|Elder financial abuse}}

The elderly are sometimes victims of financial abuse from people within their family:
* Money or property is used without their permission or taken from them
* Their signature is forged for financial transactions
* Coerced or influence to sign over deeds, wills or power of attorney
* Deceived into believing that money is exchanged for the promise of lifelong care&lt;ref name=NCPEA&gt;[http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html ''Financial Abuse.''] National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (NCPEA). 2008. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person.  Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or substance abuse.&lt;ref name=NCPEA/&gt;

It is estimated that there may be 5 million elderly citizens of the United States subject to financial abuse each year.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Laws==

===United States===
The Survivors’ Empowerment and Economic Security Act was introduced by the [[110th United States Congress]] to the Senate (S. 1136) and House of Representatives (H.R. 2395) to allow for greater economic freedom for domestic violence victims by providing short-term emergency benefits where needed, guaranteeing employment leave and unemployment compensation, and prohibit insurance restriction or job discrimination to domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

The '''''Energiewende''''' ([[German language|German]] for '''[[energy transition]]''') is the planned transition by [[Germany]] to a [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon]], environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |author2 = Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) |title = Energy concept for an environmentally sound, reliable and affordable energy supply |date = 28 September 2010 |publisher = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |place = Berlin, Germany |url = http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf |access-date = 2016-05-01 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040920/http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept%2Cproperty%3Dpdf%2Cbereich%3Dbmwi%2Csprache%3Den%2Crwb%3Dtrue.pdf |archivedate = 6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative support for the ''Energiewende'' was passed in late 2010 and includes [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) reductions of 80–95% by 2050 (relative to 1990) and a [[renewable energy]] target of 60% by 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Energy of the Future: Fourth "Energy Transition" Monitoring Report — Summary | date = November 2015 | publisher = Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) | place = Berlin, Germany

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG [[emissions reduction]] target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014. 
However the country will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3.5% per year to reach its ''Energiewende'' goal, equal to the maximum historical value thus far.&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-etal-2015"&gt;

The term ''Energiewende'' was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the German [[Öko-Institut]], calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy.&lt;ref name="krause-etal-1980"&gt;

}} In support of the claim that Krause et al (1980) was the first use of the term ''Energiewende''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}
The most groundbreaking claim was that economic growth was possible without increased energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;https://book.energytransition.org/origin-term-energiewende&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16{{nbsp}}February 1980, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment also hosted a symposium in Berlin, called ''Energiewende – Atomausstieg und Klimaschutz'' (Energy Transition: Nuclear Phase-Out and Climate Protection).  The Institute for Applied Ecology was funded by both environmental and religious organizations, and the importance of religious and conservative figures like Wolf von Fabeck and Peter Ahmels was crucial.  In the following decades, the term ''Energiewende'' expanded in scope – in its present form it dates back to at least 2002.

''Energiewende'' designates a significant change in [[energy policy]].  The term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency.

In a broader sense, this transition also entails a [[democratization]] of energy.&lt;ref name="paulitz"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the traditional energy industry, a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power. Renewable energies, in contrast, can, as a rule, be established in a decentralized manner.  Public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production.&lt;ref name="dnr-2011"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals.  Municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially, while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders.  Also significant, the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region.  Renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy, and local governments often promote them.

== Status ==

The key policy document outlining the ''Energiewende'' was published by the German government in September 2010, some six months before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear accident]].&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"/&gt;  Legislative support was passed in September 2010.  On 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"&gt;

After the 2013 federal elections, the new [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government continued the ''Energiewende'', with only minor modification of its goals in the coalition agreement.

These targets go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states.  The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits.  The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market.  However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt;  The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity [[price]]s (including taxes) in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates ([[feed-in tariff]]s) will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-a"/&gt;

Among other things, wind and PV cannot be principally refinanced under the current [[marginal cost]] based market.

Most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the ''Energiewende'' rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies.

Coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the ''Energiewende''.  Some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants, along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out.&lt;ref name="agora-2016a"&gt;

Coal comprised 42% of electricity generation in 2015.  If Germany is to limit its contribution to a [[Global Warming|global temperature increase]] to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels, as declared in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]], a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to [[100% renewable energy]] is required by about 2040.&lt;ref name="quaschning-2016"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency.  German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

An official federal government report on progress under the ''Energiewende'', updated for 2014, notes that:&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"/&gt;

* energy consumption fell by 4.7% in 2014 (from 2013) and at {{val|13132}}{{nbsp}}petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
* renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity
* energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6% between 2008 and 2014

The goal to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 "will most likely be missed{{nbsp}}... if no further measures are taken" and the 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is "unachievable" with the current plans for renewables expansion.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"&gt;

The fifth monitoring report on the ''Energiewende'' for 2015 was published in December 2016.  The expert commission which wrote the report warns that Germany will probably miss its 2020 climate targets and believes that this could threaten the credibility of the entire endeavor.  The commission puts forward a number of measures to address the slowdown, including a flat national {{CO2}} price imposed across all sectors, a greater focus on transport, and full market exposure for renewable generation.  Regarding the carbon price, the commission thinks that a reformed [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU{{nbsp}}ETS]] would be better, but that achieving agreement across Europe is unlikely.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wehrmann-2016"&gt;

== Citizen support and participation ==

{{as of|2016}}, citizen support for the ''Energiewende'' remains high, with recent surveys indicating that about 80–90% of the public are in favor.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Sören | last1 = Amelang | first2 = Julian | last2 = Wettengel	 | title = Polls reveal citizens' support for Energiewende | date = 4 May 2016 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One reason for the high acceptance is the substantial participation of German citizens in the ''Energiewende'', as private households, land owners, or members of energy cooperatives (''Genossenschaft'').&lt;ref name="borchert-2015"&gt;{{cite news | first = Lars | last = Borchert	 | title = Germany between citizens' energy and Nimbyism | date = 10 March 2015 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/peoples-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2016 survey showed that roughly one in two Germans would consider investing in community renewable energy projects.&lt;ref name="st-gallen-2016"&gt;{{cite web | title = About one in two Germans is willing to financially participate in solar photovoltaic or wind power capacity | date = 8 September 2016 | website = [[University of St Gallen]] | location = St Gallen, Switzerland | url = http://www.unisg.ch/en/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2016/september/energiewende-deutschland-investoren-umfrage-08september2016 | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer studies ==

Much of the policy development for the ''Energiewende'' is underpinned by [[computer simulation|computer models]], run mostly by universities and research institutes.  The models are usually based on [[scenario analysis]] and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability, sustainability, cost, efficiency, and public acceptability of various sets of technologies.  Some models cover the entire [[energy sector]], while others are confined to [[electricity generation]] and consumption.  A 2016 book investigates the usefulness and limitations of energy scenarios and energy models within the context of the ''Energiewende''.&lt;ref name="dieckhoff-and-leuschner-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- publishers url: www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-3171-5 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of computer studies confirm the feasibility of the German electricity system being 100% renewable in 2050.  Some investigate the prospect of the entire energy system (all energy carriers) being fully renewable too.

=== 2009 WWF study ===

In 2009 [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Germany published a quantitative study prepared by the [[Öko-Institut]], Prognos, and Hans-Joachim Ziesing.&lt;ref name="wwf-germany-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The study presumes a 95% reduction in [[greenhouse gas]]es by the year 2050 and covers all sectors.  The study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and  affordable.  It notes that by committing to this transformation  path, Germany could become a model for other countries.

=== 2011 German Advisory Council on the Environment study ===

A 2011 report from the [[:de:Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]] (SRU) concludes that Germany can attain 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050.&lt;ref name="sru-2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) REMix high-resolution energy model was used for the analysis.  A range of scenarios were investigated and a cost-competitive transition with good security of supply is possible.

The authors presume that the transmission network will continue to be reinforced and that cooperation with Norway and Sweden would allow their hydro generation to be utilized for storage.  The transition does not require Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''{{lang|de|Atomausstieg}}'') to be extended nor the construction of coal-fired plants with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  Conventional generation assets need not be stranded and an orderly transition should prevail.  Stringent energy efficiency and energy saving programs can bring down the future costs of electricity.

=== 2015 Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project study ===

The [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a [[low-carbon economy]].
The 2015 German country report, produced in association with the [[Wuppertal Institute]], examines the official target of reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 (compared with 1990).&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Decarbonization  pathways  for  Germany  are  illustrated  by  means  of  three  ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80%  and  more  than  90%.  Three strategies strongly contribute to GHG emission reduction: 
* energy efficiency improvements (in all sectors but especially in buildings)
* increased use of domestic renewables (with a focus on electricity generation)
* electrification  and  (in  two  of  the  scenarios  also)  use  of  renewable  electricity-based synthetic fuels (especially in the transport and industry sector)
In addition, some scenarios use controversially:
* final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes ([[mode of transport|modal shift]] in transport, changes in eating and heating habits)
* net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of [[bioenergy]]
* use of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology to reduce industry sector GHG emissions (including cement production)
Potential co-benefits for Germany include increased energy security, higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies, job creation, stronger GDP growth, smaller energy bills for households, and less air pollution.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The guiding question of the study is: how can a cost-optimised transformation of the German energy system — with consideration of all [[energy carrier]]s and consumer sectors — be achieved while meeting the declared [[climate protection]] targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times.  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) is explicitly excluded from the scenarios.  A future energy scenario emitting 85% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario, which assumes that the German energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today.  Under this comparison, primary energy supply drops 42%.  The total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil.  If the penalty for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increases to €100/tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2%, then the total cumulative costs of today's energy system are 8% higher than the costs required for the minus 85% scenario up to 2050.  The report also notes:

{{quote|From the macroeconomic perspective, the transformation of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance.  In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis.&lt;ref name="henning-and-palzer-2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}}}

=== 2015 DIW study ===

A 2015 study uses DIETER or Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables, developed by the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), Berlin, Germany.  The study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability.  The model is fully described in the study report.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Set in 2050, several scenarios use [[gas turbine#industrial gas turbines for power generation|gas power plants]] to stabilise the backbone of energy system, ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation.  Other scenarios investigate a 100% renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly.  Flexible consumption and storage control ([[energy demand management|demand-side management]]) in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations.  Long-term storage systems, based on [[power-to-X]], are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80%.  On the question of costs, the study notes:

{{quote|Assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level, a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will, as a rule, come  cheaper  than  a  system  dominated by fossil fuel power plants.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;{{rp|7}}}}

Load shares in 2050 would be: on-shore wind 35%, off-shore wind 17%, wave 0.08%, geothermal 0.01%, hydro-electric 0.87%, tidal 0%, residential PV 6.75%, commercial PV 6.48%, utility PV 33.8%, and [[concentrating solar power]] 0%.  The study also assess avoided air pollution, eliminated global climate change costs, and net job creation.  These co-benefits are substantial.

{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage}}

Using biomass as a fuel produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants. However, since the beginning of the Energiewende the balance of biomass vs other forms of renewable energy has shifted; biomass made up 7.0% of Germany's power generation mix in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://energytransition.org/2018/01/german-energy-consumption-2017/|title=Germany’s energy consumption in 2017|date=2018-01-11|work=Energy Transition|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass has the potential to be a [[carbon-neutral]] fuel because growing biomass absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and a portion of the carbon absorbed remains in the ground after harvest.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass contains less sulfur than coal and so produces much less sulfur dioxide than coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal?|author=Eartha Jane Melzer|date=January 26, 2010|work=The Michigan Messenger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|archivedate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's {{CO2}} emissions were escalating in 2012 and 2013 and it is planned to reopen some of the dirtiest brown coal mines that had previously been closed.  Coal generated electricity increased to 45% in 2013, the highest level since 2007.&lt;ref name="andresen-2014"&gt;{{cite news

Nonetheless, in 2014 carbon emissions had declined again.  More renewable energy had been generated and a greater energy efficiency had been achieved.&lt;ref name="rueter-2015"&gt;

'''Enterprise application integration''' ('''EAI''') is the use of [[software]] and computer systems' architectural principles to integrate a set of [[enterprise computer application]]s.

== Overview ==
Enterprise application integration is an integration framework composed of a collection of technologies and services which form a [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] or "middleware framework" to enable integration of systems and applications across an enterprise.

Many types of business software such as [[supply chain management]] applications, [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems, [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] applications for managing customers, [[business intelligence]] applications, [[payroll]] and [[human resources]] systems typically cannot communicate with one another in order to share data or business rules. For this reason, such applications are sometimes referred to as [[islands of automation]] or [[information silo]]s. This lack of communication leads to inefficiencies, wherein identical data are stored in multiple locations, or straightforward processes are unable to be automated.

Enterprise application integration is the process of linking such applications within a single organization together in order to simplify and automate business processes to the greatest extent possible, while at the same time avoiding having to make sweeping changes to the existing applications or data structures. Applications can be linked either at the back-end via [[API]]s or (seldomly) the front-end ([[GUI]]).&lt;ref&gt;CEITON technologies [http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/system-centric-bpms.html#Back-End_EAI "Front-end and back-end EAI"] ''[[CEITON technologies]]'' Retrieved on 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of research firm [[Gartner]], EAI is the "unrestricted sharing of data and business processes among any connected application or data sources in the enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;In its April 2001 report for AIIM International, "Enterprise Applications: Adoption of E-Business and Document Technologies, 2000–2001: Worldwide Industry Study," Gartner defines EAI as "the unrestricted sharing of data and business processes among any connected applications and data sources in the enterprise."&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.techstreet.com/direct/ExSum_EU.pdf |title=Enterprise application integration |journal=Information Management Journal |date=March–April 2002 |last=Gable |first=Julie |accessdate=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various systems that need to be linked together may reside on different [[operating system]]s, use different [[database]] solutions or [[computer language]]s, or different date and time formats, or may be [[legacy system]]s that are no longer supported by the vendor who originally created them. In some cases, such systems are dubbed "[[stovepipe system]]s" because they consist of components that have been jammed together in a way that makes it very hard to modify them in any way.

=== Improving connectivity ===
If integration is applied without following a structured EAI approach, [[Link (telecommunications)#Point-to-point|point-to-point connections]] grow across an organization. Dependencies are added on an impromptu basis, resulting in a complex structure that is difficult to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;CEITON technologies [http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/integration-EAI.png "Diagram of point-to-point spaghetti structure"]''[[CEITON technologies]]'' Retrieved on 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly referred to as spaghetti, an allusion to the programming equivalent of [[spaghetti code]]. For example:

The number of connections needed to have fully meshed point-to-point connections, with {{mvar|n}} points, is given by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n 2 = \tfrac{n(n-1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[binomial coefficient]]). Thus, for ten applications to be fully integrated point-to-point, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{10\times9}{2} = 45&lt;/math&gt; point-to-point connections are needed.

However the number of connections within organizations does not grow according to the square of the number points. In general, the number of connections to any point is independent of the number of other points in an organization. ([[Thought experiment]]: if an additional point is added to your organization, are you aware of it? Does it increase the number of connections other unrelated points have?) There are a small number of "collection" points for which this does not apply, but these do not require EAI patterns to manage.

EAI can also increase coupling between systems and therefore increase management overhead and costs.

However, EAI is not just about sharing data between applications; it focuses on sharing both business data and business process. A [[middleware analyst]] attending to EAI may also look at the [[system of systems]].

=== Purposes ===
EAI can be used for different purposes:
*[[Data integration]]: Ensures that information in multiple systems is kept consistent. This is also known as [[enterprise information integration]] (EII).
*Vendor independence: Extracts business policies or rules from applications and implements them in the EAI system, so that even if one of the business applications is replaced with a different vendor's application, the business rules do not have to be re-implemented.
*Common facade: An EAI system can front-end a cluster of applications, providing a single consistent access interface to these applications and shielding users from having to learn to use different software packages.

=== Patterns ===
This section describes common design patterns for implementing EAI, including integration, access and lifetime patterns.  These are abstract patterns and can be implemented in many different ways. There are many other patterns commonly used in the industry, ranging from high-level abstract design patterns to highly specific implementation patterns.&lt;ref name="Enterprise Integration Patterns"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ | title=Messaging Patterns Overview | publisher=Enterpriseintergationpatterns.com and Addison-Wesley | date=2015 | accessdate=May 19, 2016 |author1=Hohpe, Gregor |author2=Woolf, Bobby }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Integration patterns ====
There are two patterns that EAI systems implement:&lt;ref&gt;MSquare Systems [http://www.msquaresystems.com/enterprise-application-2/eai "Types of EAI"] ''[[MSquare Systems]]'' Retrieved on 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Data mediation|Mediation]] (intra-communication):Here, the EAI system acts as the go-between or broker between multiple applications. Whenever an interesting event occurs in an application (for instance, new information is created or a new transaction completed) an integration module in the EAI system is notified. The module then propagates the changes to other relevant applications.
;[[Federation (information technology)|Federation]] (inter-communication):In this case, the EAI system acts as the overarching facade across multiple applications. All event calls from the 'outside world' to any of the applications are front-ended by the EAI system. The EAI system is configured to expose only the relevant information and interfaces of the underlying applications to the outside world, and performs all interactions with the underlying applications on behalf of the requester.

Both patterns are often used concurrently. The same EAI system could be keeping multiple applications in sync (mediation), while servicing requests from external users against these applications (federation).

==== Access patterns ====
EAI supports both asynchronous (fire and forget) and synchronous access patterns, the former being typical in the mediation case and the latter in the federation case.  {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section|date=May 2016}}

==== Lifetime patterns ====
An integration operation could be short-lived (e.g. keeping data in sync across two applications could be completed within a second) or long-lived (e.g. one of the steps could involve the EAI system interacting with a human [[work flow]] application for approval of a loan that takes hours or days to complete). {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section|date=May 2016}}

=== Topologies ===
There are two major topologies:-- [[Hub and spoke|hub-and-spoke]], and [[Enterprise service bus|bus]]. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the hub-and-spoke model, the EAI system is at the center (the hub), and interacts with the applications via the spokes. In the bus model, the EAI system is the bus (or is implemented as a resident module in an already existing message bus or [[message-oriented middleware]]).

Most large enterprises use zoned network to create layered defense against network oriented threats. For example, an enterprise typically has a credit card processing (PCI-compliant) zone, a non-PCI zone, a data zone, a DMZ zone to proxy external user access, and an IWZ zone to proxy internal user access. Applications need to integrate across multiple zones. The '''Hub and spoke''' model would work better in this case.

=== Technologies ===
Multiple technologies are used in implementing each of the components of the EAI system:
;Bus/hub: This is usually implemented by enhancing standard middleware products ([[application server]], message bus) or implemented as a stand-alone program (i.&amp;nbsp;e., does not use any middleware), acting as its own middleware.
;Application connectivity: The bus/hub connects to applications through a set of '''adapters''' (also referred to as '''connectors'''). These are programs that know how to interact with an underlying business application. The adapter performs two-way communication, performing requests from the hub against the application, and notifying the hub when an event of interest occurs in the application (a new record inserted, a transaction completed, etc.). Adapters can be specific to an application (e.&amp;nbsp;g., built against the application vendor's client libraries) or specific to a class of applications (e.&amp;nbsp;g., can interact with any application through a standard communication protocol, such as [[SOAP]], [[SMTP]] or [[Action Message Format]] (AMF)). The adapter could reside in the same process space as the bus/hub or execute in a remote location and interact with the hub/bus through industry standard protocols such as message queues, web services, or even use a proprietary protocol. In the Java world, standards such as [[J2EE Connector Architecture|JCA]] allow adapters to be created in a vendor-neutral manner.
;[[File format|Data format]] and [[data transformation|transformation]]: To avoid every adapter having to convert data to/from every other applications' formats, EAI systems usually stipulate an application-independent (or common) data format. The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application's format to the bus's common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).
;Integration modules: An EAI system could be participating in multiple concurrent integration operations at any given time, each type of integration being processed by a different integration module. Integration modules subscribe to events of specific types and process notifications that they receive when these events occur. These modules could be implemented in different ways: on [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based EAI systems, these could be [[web application]]s or [[Enterprise JavaBean|EJBs]] or even [[POJO]]s that conform to the EAI system's specifications.
;Support for [[Database transaction|transaction]]s: When used for process integration, the EAI system also provides transactional consistency across applications by executing all integration operations across all applications in a single overarching distributed transaction (using [[two-phase commit protocol]]s or [[compensating transaction]]s).

=== Communication architectures ===
Currently, there are many variations of thought on what constitutes the best infrastructure, component model, and standards structure for Enterprise Application Integration. There seems to be consensus that four components are essential for a modern enterprise application integration architecture:
#A centralized broker that handles security, access, and communication. This can be accomplished through integration servers (like the [[Schools Interoperability Framework|School Interoperability Framework (SIF)]] Zone Integration Servers) or through similar software like the [[enterprise service bus]] (ESB) model that acts as a services manager.
#An independent data model based on a standard data structure, also known as a [[Canonical Model|canonical data model]]. It appears that XML and the use of XML style sheets has become the ''[[de facto]]'' and in some cases ''[[de jure]]'' standard for this uniform business language.
#A connector, or agent model where each vendor, application, or interface can build a single component that can speak natively to that application and communicate with the centralized broker.
#A system model that defines the APIs, data flow and rules of engagement to the system such that components can be built to interface with it in a standardized way.

Although other approaches like connecting at the database or user-interface level have been explored, they have not been found to scale or be able to adjust. Individual applications can publish messages to the centralized broker and subscribe to receive certain messages from that broker. Each application only requires one connection to the broker. This central control approach can be extremely [[scalable]] and [[Event-driven SOA|highly evolvable]].

Enterprise Application Integration is related to middleware technologies such as message-oriented middleware ([[message-oriented middleware|MOM]]), and data representation technologies such as [[XML]] or [[JSON]]. Other EAI technologies involve using [[web service]]s as part of [[service-oriented architecture]] as a means of integration. Enterprise Application Integration tends to be data centric. In the near future, it will come to include [[Enterprise Content Integration|content integration]] and [[business process]]es.

=== Implementation pitfalls ===
In 2003 it was reported that 70% of all EAI projects fail. Most of these failures are not due to the software itself or technical difficulties, but due to management issues. Integration Consortium European Chairman Steve Craggs has outlined the seven main pitfalls undertaken by companies using EAI systems and explains solutions to these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dancing Around EAI 'Bear Traps'|date=2003-12-15|first=Gian|last=Trotta|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/int_sbp/features/3463.html|accessdate=2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Constant change: The very nature of EAI is dynamic and requires dynamic project managers to manage their implementation.
#Shortage of [[middleware analyst|EAI expert]]s: EAI requires knowledge of many issues and technical aspects.
#Competing standards: Within the EAI field, the paradox is that EAI standards themselves are not universal.
#EAI is a tool paradigm: EAI is not a tool, but rather a system and should be implemented as such.
#Building interfaces is an art: Engineering the solution is not sufficient. Solutions need to be negotiated with user departments to reach a common consensus on the final outcome. A lack of consensus on interface designs leads to excessive effort to map between various systems data requirements.
#Loss of detail: Information that seemed unimportant at an earlier stage may become crucial later.
#Accountability: Since so many departments have many conflicting requirements, there should be clear accountability for the system's final structure.

Other potential problems may arise in these areas:
*Lack of centralized co-ordination of EAI work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoiding Pitfalls of Integration Competency Centers|date=2013-10-25|first=Antti|last=Toivanen|url=http://integrationwarstories.com/2013/10/25/avoiding-pitfalls-of-integration-competency-centers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emerging Requirements: EAI implementations should be extensible and modular to allow for future changes.
*Protectionism: The applications whose data is being integrated often belong to different departments that have technical, cultural, and political reasons for not wanting to share their data with other departments

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30182">In [[computer programming]], an '''enumerated type''' (also called '''enumeration''', '''enum''', or '''factor''' in the [[R (programming language)|R programming language]], and a [[categorical variable]] in statistics) is a [[data type]] consisting of a set of named [[value (computer science)|values]] called ''elements'', ''members'', ''enumeral'',  or ''enumerators'' of the type. The enumerator names are usually [[identifier]]s that behave as [[constant (programming)|constants]] in the language. An enumerated type can be seen as a degenerate [[tagged union]] of [[unit type]]. A [[variable (computer science)|variable]] that has been [[declaration (computer science)|declared]] as having an enumerated type can be assigned any of the enumerators as a value. In other words, an enumerated type has values that are different from each other, and that can be compared and assigned, but are not specified by the programmer  as having any particular concrete representation in the computer's memory; compilers and interpreters can represent them arbitrarily.

For example, the four [[Suit (cards)|suits]] in a deck of playing cards may be four enumerators named ''Club'', ''Diamond'', ''Heart'', and ''Spade'', belonging to an enumerated type named ''suit''. If a variable ''V'' is declared having ''suit'' as its data type, one can assign any of those four values to it.

Although the enumerators are usually distinct, some languages may allow the same enumerator to be listed twice in the type's declaration. The names of enumerators need not be semantically complete or compatible in any sense. For example, an enumerated type called ''color'' may be defined to consist of the enumerators ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Zebra'', ''Missing'', and ''Bacon''. In some languages, the declaration of an enumerated type also intentionally defines an [[total order|ordering]] of its members; in others, the enumerators are unordered; in others still, an implicit ordering arises from the compiler concretely representing enumerators as integers.

Some enumerator types may be [[built-in type|built into]] the language. The [[Boolean type]], for example is often a pre-defined enumeration of the values ''False'' and ''True''. Many languages allow users to define new enumerated types.

Values and variables of an enumerated type are usually implemented as fixed-length [[bit string]]s, often in a format and size compatible with some [[integer (computer science)|integer]] type. Some languages, especially [[system programming language]]s, allow the user to specify the bit combination to be used for each enumerator. In [[type theory]], enumerated types are often regarded as [[tagged union]]s of [[unit type]]s. Since such types are of the form &lt;math&gt;1 + 1 + \cdots + 1&lt;/math&gt;, they may also be written as natural numbers.

==Rationale==
Some early programming languages did not originally have enumerated types. If a programmer wanted a variable, for example ''myColor'', to have a value of red, the variable red would be declared and assigned some arbitrary value, usually an integer constant. The variable red would then be assigned to ''myColor''. Other techniques assigned arbitrary values to strings containing the names of the enumerators.

These arbitrary values were sometimes referred to as [[magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] since there often was no explanation as to how the numbers were obtained or whether their actual values were significant. These magic numbers could make the source code harder for others to understand and maintain.

Enumerated types, on the other hand, make the code more self-documenting. Depending on the language, the compiler could automatically assign default values to the enumerators thereby hiding unnecessary detail from the programmer. These values may not even be visible to the programmer (see [[information hiding]]). Enumerated types can also prevent a programmer from writing illogical code such as performing mathematical operations on the values of the enumerators. If the value of a variable that was assigned an enumerator were to be printed, some programming languages could also print the name of the enumerator rather than its underlying numerical value. A further advantage is that enumerated types can allow compilers to enforce semantic correctness. For instance:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
myColor = TRIANGLE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
can be forbidden, whilst &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
myColor = RED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
is accepted, even if ''TRIANGLE'' and ''RED'' are both internally represented as ''1''.

Conceptually, an enumerated type is similar to a list of [[nominal number|nominals]] (numeric codes), since each possible value of the type is assigned a distinctive natural number. A given enumerated type is thus a concrete implementation of this notion. When order is meaningful and/or used for comparison, then an enumerated type becomes an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] type.

== Conventions ==

[[Programming languages]] tend to have their own, oftentimes multiple, [[programming styles]] and [[Naming_convention_(programming)|naming conventions]]. Enumerations frequently follow either a [[PascalCase]] or [[uppercase]] convention, while [[lowercase]] and others are seen less frequently.

== Pascal and syntactically similar languages ==

=== Pascal ===
In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], an enumerated type can be implicitly declared by listing the values in a parenthesised list:
  &lt;source lang=Pascal&gt;
  var
    suit: (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades);
  &lt;/source&gt;
The declaration will often appear in a type synonym declaration, such that it can be used for multiple variables:

&lt;source lang=Pascal&gt;
  type
    cardsuit = (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades);
    card = record
             suit: cardsuit;
             value: 1 .. 13;
           end;
  var
    hand: array [ 1 .. 13 ] of card;
    trump: cardsuit;
&lt;/source&gt;
  
The order in which the enumeration values are given matters. An enumerated type is an ordinal type, and the &lt;code&gt;pred&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;succ&lt;/code&gt; functions will give the prior or next value of the enumeration, and &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; can convert enumeration values to their integer representation. Standard Pascal does not offer a conversion from arithmetic types to enumerations, however. Extended Pascal offers this functionality via an extended &lt;code&gt;succ&lt;/code&gt; function. Some other Pascal dialects allow it via type-casts. Some modern descendants of Pascal, such as [[Modula-3]], provide a special conversion syntax using a method called &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt;; Modula-3 also treats &lt;code&gt;BOOLEAN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CHAR&lt;/code&gt; as special pre-defined enumerated types and uses &lt;code&gt;ORD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; for standard [[ASCII]] decoding and encoding.

Pascal style languages also allow enumeration to be used as array index:

  &lt;source lang=Pascal&gt;
  var
    suitcount: array [cardsuit] of integer;
  &lt;/source&gt;

=== Ada ===

In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], the use of "=" was replaced with "is" leaving the definition quite similar:

 &lt;source lang=Ada&gt;type Cardsuit is (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades);&lt;/source&gt;

In addition to &lt;code&gt;Pred&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Succ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Val&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Pos&lt;/code&gt; Ada also supports simple string conversions via &lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Value&lt;/code&gt;.

Similar to C-style languages Ada allows the internal representation of the enumeration to be specified:

 &lt;source lang=Ada&gt;
 for Cardsuit use
   (clubs =&gt; 1, diamonds =&gt; 2, hearts =&gt; 4, spades =&gt; 8);
 &lt;/source&gt;

Unlike C-style languages Ada also allows the number of bits of the enumeration to be specified:

  &lt;source lang=Ada&gt;for Cardsuit'Size use 4;  -- 4 bits&lt;/source&gt;

Additionally, one can use enumerations as indexes for arrays, like in Pascal, but there are attributes defined for enumerations
&lt;source lang=Ada&gt;
   Shuffle : constant array(Cardsuit) of Cardsuit :=
     (Clubs =&gt; Cardsuit'Succ(Clubs), -- see attributes of enumerations 'First, 'Last, 'Succ, 'Pred
      Diamonds =&gt; Hearts, --an explicit value
      Hearts =&gt; Cardsuit'Last, --first enumeration value of type Cardsuit e.g., clubs
      Spades =&gt; Cardsuit'First --last enumeration value of type Cardsuit e.g., spades
      );
&lt;/source&gt;

Like [[Modula-3]] Ada treats &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt; as special pre-defined (in package "&lt;code&gt;Standard&lt;/code&gt;") enumerated types. Unlike Modula-3 one can also define own character types:

 &lt;source lang=Ada&gt;type Cards is ('7', '8', '9', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A');&lt;/source&gt;

== C and syntactically similar languages ==

=== C ===
The original [[K&amp;R C|K&amp;R]] dialect of the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] had no enumerated types. They were added in the [[ANSI]] standard for C, which became [[ANSI C]] (sometimes termed C89). In C, enumerations are created by explicit definitions (the &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; keyword by itself does not cause allocation of storage) which use the &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; keyword and are reminiscent of [[struct (C programming language)|struct]] and [[Union type|union]] definitions:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
enum cardsuit {
   Clubs,
   Diamonds,
   Hearts,
   Spades
};

struct card {
   enum cardsuit suit;
   short int value;
} hand[13];

enum cardsuit trump;
&lt;/source&gt;

C exposes the integer representation of enumeration values directly to the programmer. Integers and enum values can be mixed freely, and all arithmetic operations on enum values are permitted. It is even possible for an enum variable to hold an integer that does not represent any of the enumeration values. In fact, according to the language definition, the above code will define &lt;code&gt;Clubs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Diamonds&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Hearts&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Spades&lt;/code&gt; as constants of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, which will only be converted (silently) to &lt;code&gt;enum cardsuit&lt;/code&gt; if they are stored in a variable of that type.

C also allows the programmer to choose the values of the enumeration constants explicitly, even without type. For example,

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
enum cardsuit {
    Clubs    = 1,
    Diamonds = 2,
    Hearts   = 4,
    Spades   = 8
};
&lt;/source&gt;

could be used to define a type that allows mathematical sets of suits to be represented as an &lt;code&gt;enum cardsuit&lt;/code&gt; by bitwise logic operations.

=== Swift ===

In C, enumerations assign related names to a set of integer values. In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], enumerations are much more flexible and need not provide a value for each case of the enumeration. If a value (termed a ''raw'' value) is provided for each enumeration case, the value can be a string, a character, or a value of any integer or floating-point type.

Alternatively, enumeration cases can specify associated values of any type to be stored along with each different case value, much as unions or variants do in other languages. One can define a common set of related cases as part of one enumeration, each of which has a different set of values of appropriate types associated with it.

In Swift, enumerations are a first-class type. They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes, such as computed properties to provide additional information about the enumeration’s current value, and instance methods to provide functionality related to the values the enumeration represents. Enumerations can also define initializers to provide an initial case value and can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation; and can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.

&lt;source lang="Swift"&gt;
enum CardSuit {
     case clubs
     case diamonds
     case hearts
     case spades
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike C and [[Objective-C]], Swift enumeration cases are not assigned a default integer value when they are created. In the CardSuit example above, clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades do not implicitly equal 0, 1, 2 and 3. Instead, the different enumeration cases are fully-fledged values in their own right, with an explicitly-defined type of CardSuit.

Multiple cases can appear on a single line, separated by commas:
&lt;source lang="Swift"&gt;
enum CardSuit {
     case clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When working with enumerations that store integer or string raw values, one doesn’t need to explicitly assign a raw value for each case because Swift will automatically assign the values.

For instance, when integers are used for raw values, the implicit value for each case is one more than the previous case. If the first case doesn’t have a value set, its value is 0.

The enumeration below is a refinement of the earlier Planet enumeration, with integer raw values to represent each planet’s order from the sun:

&lt;source lang="Swift"&gt;
enum Planet: Int {
     case mercury = 1, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In the example above, Planet.mercury has an explicit raw value of 1, Planet.venus has an implicit raw value of 2, and so on.

[https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html "Details are found in Swift documentation online here."]

=== Perl ===
Dynamically typed languages in the syntactic tradition of C (e.g., [[Perl]] or [[JavaScript]]) do not, in general, provide enumerations.  But in Perl programming the same result can be obtained with the shorthand [[String literal|strings]] [[List (abstract data type)|list]] and [[Hash table|hashes]] (possibly [[Array slicing|slices]]):

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
my @enum = qw(Clubs Diamonds Hearts Spades);
my( %set1, %set2 );
@set1{@enum} = ();          # all cleared
@set2{@enum} = (1) x @enum; # all set to 1
$set1{Clubs} ...            # false
$set2{Diamonds} ...         # true
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===
[[Perl 6]] does provide enumerations. There are multiple ways to declare enumerations in [[Perl 6]], all creating a back-end Map.

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;enum Cat &lt;sphynx siamese bengal shorthair other&gt;; # Using "quote-words"&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;enum Cat ('sphynx', 'siamese', 'bengal', 'shorthair', 'other'); # Using a list&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;enum Cat (sphynx =&gt; 0, siamese =&gt; 1, bengal =&gt; 2, shorthair =&gt; 3, other =&gt; 4); # Using Pair constructors&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;enum Cat (:sphynx(0), :siamese(1), :bengal(2), shorthair(3), :other(4)); # Another way of using Pairs, you can also use `:0sphynx`&lt;/source&gt;

===C#===

Enumerated types in the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language preserve most of the "small integer" semantics of C's enums. Some arithmetic operations are not defined for enums, but an enum value can be explicitly converted to an integer and back again, and an enum variable can have values that were not declared by the enum definition. For example, given

 &lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;enum Cardsuit { Clubs, Diamonds, Spades, Hearts };&lt;/source&gt;

the expressions &lt;code lang=CSharp&gt;CardSuit.Diamonds + 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code lang=CSharp&gt;CardSuit.Hearts - CardSuit.Clubs&lt;/code&gt; are allowed directly (because it may make sense to step through the sequence of values or ask how many steps there are between two values), but &lt;code lang=CSharp&gt;CardSuit.Hearts*CardSuit.Spades&lt;/code&gt; is deemed to make less sense and is only allowed if the values are first converted to integers.

C# also provides the C-like feature of being able to define specific integer values for enumerations. By doing this it is possible to perform binary operations on enumerations, thus treating enumeration values as sets of flags. These flags can be tested using binary operations or with the Enum type's builtin 'HasFlag' method.

The enumeration definition defines names for the selected integer values and is [[syntactic sugar]], as it is possible to assign to an enum variable other integer values that are not in the scope of the enum definition.&lt;ref name="enum"&gt;{{cite web

=== C++ ===

[[C++]] has enumeration types that are directly inherited from C's and work mostly like these, except that an enumeration is a real type in C++, giving added compile-time checking. Also (as with structs), the C++ &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; keyword is automatically combined with a ''typedef'', so that instead of naming the type &lt;code&gt;enum name&lt;/code&gt;, simply name it &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. This can be simulated in C using a typedef: &lt;code&gt;typedef enum {Value1, Value2} name;&lt;/code&gt;

[[C++11]] provides a second, type-safe enumeration type that is not implicitly converted to an integer type. It allows io streaming to be defined for that type. Additionally the enumerations do not leak, so they have to be used with Enumeration &lt;code&gt;Type::enumeration&lt;/code&gt;. This is specified by the phrase "enum class". For example:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
enum class Color {Red, Green, Blue};
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''underlying type'' is an implementation-defined integral type that is large enough to hold all enumerated values (it doesn't have to be the smallest possible type!). In C++ you can specify the underlying type directly. That allows "forward declarations" of enumerations:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
enum class Color : long {Red, Green, Blue};  // must fit in size and memory layout the type 'long'
enum class Shapes : char;  // forward declaration. If later there are values defined that don't fit in 'char' it is an error.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Rust ===

&lt;source lang=Rust&gt;
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 }, // anonymous struct
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Go===

[[Go (programming language)|Go]] uses the &lt;code&gt;iota&lt;/code&gt; keyword to create enumerated constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url         = http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#constants
 | title       = Effective Go
 | work=golang.org
 | publisher=The Go Authors
 | accessdate  = 2014-05-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=Go&gt;
type ByteSize float64

const (
    _           = iota // ignore first value by assigning to blank identifier
    KB ByteSize = 1 &lt;&lt; (10 * iota)
    MB
    GB
)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===

The J2SE version 5.0 of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] added enumerated types whose declaration syntax is
similar to that of [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang=Java5&gt;
  enum Cardsuit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, SPADES, HEARTS };
  ...
  Cardsuit trump;
&lt;/source&gt;

The Java type system, however, treats enumerations as a type separate from integers, and intermixing of enum and integer values is not allowed. In fact, an enum type in Java is actually a special compiler-generated [[class (computer science)|class]] rather than an arithmetic type, and enum values behave as global pre-generated instances of that class. Enum types can have instance methods and a constructor (the arguments of which can be specified separately for each enum value). All enum types implicitly extend the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Enum}} abstract class. An enum type cannot be instantiated directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url         = http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
 | title       = Enum Types
 | publisher   = Oracle
 | accessdate  = 2013-12-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, each enum value contains an integer, corresponding to the order in which they are declared in the source code, starting from 0. The programmer cannot set a custom integer for an enum value directly, but one can define overloaded constructors that can then assign arbitrary values to self-defined members of the enum class. Defining getters allows then access to those self-defined members. The internal integer can be obtained from an enum value using the {{Javadoc:SE|name=ordinal()|java/lang|Enum|ordinal()}} method, and the list of enum values of an enumeration type can be obtained in order using the &lt;code&gt;values()&lt;/code&gt; method. It is generally discouraged for programmers to convert enums to integers and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bloch |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Bloch |title=Effective Java |edition=Second |year=2008 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-321-35668-0 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enumerated types are &lt;code&gt;Comparable&lt;/code&gt;, using the internal integer; as a result, they can be sorted.

The Java standard library provides utility classes to use with enumerations. The {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|EnumSet}} class implements a &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; of enum values; it is implemented as a [[bit array]], which makes it very compact and as efficient as explicit bit manipulation, but safer. The {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|EnumMap}} class implements a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; of enum values to object. It is implemented as an array, with the integer value of the enum value serving as the index.

===TypeScript===

A helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from JavaScript is the 'enum'. Like languages like C#, an enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
enum Cardsuit {Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0. This can be changed by manually setting the value of one its members. For example, the prior example can start at 1 instead of 0:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, even manually set all the values in the enum:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds = 2, Hearts = 4, Spades = 8};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
&lt;/source&gt;

A handy feature of enums in TypeScript is that you can also go from a numeric value to the name of that value in the enum. For example, if presented with the value 2 but unsure which that mapped to in the enum, one could look up the corresponding name:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var suitName: string = Cardsuit[2];

alert(suitName);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Python==
An [https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/enum.html &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;] module was added to the Python standard library in version 3.4.&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
from enum import Enum
class Cards(Enum):
    clubs = 1
    diamonds = 2
    hearts = 3
    spades = 4
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also a [https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/enum.html#functional-api functional API] for creating enumerations with automatically generated indices (starting with one):

&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
Cards = Enum('Cards', ['clubs', 'diamonds', 'hearts', 'spades'])
&lt;/source&gt;

Python enumerations do not enforce semantic correctness (a meaningless comparison to an incompatible enumeration always returns ''False'' rather than raising a ''TypeError''):

&lt;source lang=Python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Color = Enum('Color', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shape = Enum('Shape', ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'hexagon'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; def has_vertices(shape):
... 	return shape != Shape.circle
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; has_vertices(Color.green)
True
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fortran==

[[Fortran]] only has enumerated types for interoperability with C; hence, the semantics is similar to C and, as in C, the enum values are just integers and no further type check is done. The C example from above can be written in Fortran as

&lt;source lang=Fortran&gt;
  enum, bind( C )
    enumerator :: CLUBS = 1, DIAMONDS = 2, HEARTS = 4, SPADES = 8
  end enum
&lt;/source&gt;

==Visual Basic/VBA==

Enumerated datatypes in [[Visual Basic]] (up to version 6) and [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] are automatically assigned the "&lt;code&gt;Long&lt;/code&gt;" datatype and also become a datatype themselves:

&lt;source lang=VB&gt;
'Zero-based
Enum CardSuit
   Clubs
   Diamonds
   Hearts
   Spades
End Enum

Sub EnumExample()
    Dim suit As CardSuit
    suit = Diamonds
    MsgBox suit
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Example Code in vb.Net

&lt;source lang=vbNet&gt;
Enum CardSuit
        Clubs
        Diamonds
        Hearts
        Spades
End Enum

Sub EnumExample()
        Dim suit As CardSuit
        suit = CardSuit.Diamonds
        MessageBox.show(suit)
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

== Algebraic data type in functional programming ==

In [[functional programming]] languages in the [[ML (programming language)|ML]] lineage (e.g., [[Standard ML]] (SML), [[OCaml]], and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]), an [[algebraic data type]] with only [[nullary constructor]]s can be used to implement an enumerated type. For example (in the syntax of SML signatures):
&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
 datatype cardsuit = Clubs | Diamonds | Hearts | Spades
 type card = { suit: cardsuit; value: int }
 val hand : card list
 val trump : cardsuit
&lt;/source&gt;
In these languages the small-integer representation is completely hidden from the programmer, if indeed such a representation is employed by the implementation. However, Haskell has the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; [[type class]] which a type can derive or implement to get a mapping between the type and &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;.

== Lisp ==

[[Common Lisp]] uses the member type specifier, e.g.,

&lt;source lang=Lisp&gt;
(deftype cardsuit ()
  '(member club diamond heart spade))
&lt;/source&gt;

that states that object is of type cardsuit if it is &lt;code&gt;#'eql&lt;/code&gt; to club, diamond, heart or spade. The member type specifier is not valid as a [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) parameter specializer, however. Instead, &lt;code&gt;(eql atom)&lt;/code&gt;, which is the equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(member atom)&lt;/code&gt; may be used (that is, only one member of the set may be specified with an eql type specifier, however, it may be used as a CLOS parameter specializer.) In other words, to define methods to cover an enumerated type, a method must be defined for each specific element of that type.

Additionally,

&lt;source lang=Lisp&gt;
(deftype finite-element-set-type (&amp;rest elements)
   `(member ,@elements))
&lt;/source&gt;

may be used to define arbitrary enumerated types at runtime. For instance

&lt;source lang=Lisp&gt;
(finite-element-set-type club diamond heart spade)
&lt;/source&gt;

would refer to a type equivalent to the prior definition of cardsuit, as of course would simply have been using

&lt;source lang=Lisp&gt;
(member club diamond heart spade)
&lt;/source&gt;

but may be less confusing with the function &lt;code&gt;#'member&lt;/code&gt; for stylistic reasons.

== Databases ==

Some [[database]]s support enumerated types directly. [[MySQL]] provides an enumerated type &lt;code&gt;ENUM&lt;/code&gt; with allowable values specified as strings when a table is created. The values are stored as numeric indices with the empty string stored as 0, the first string value stored as 1, the second string value stored as 2, etc. Values can be stored and retrieved as numeric indexes or string values.

== XML Schema ==

[[XML Schema]] supports enumerated types through the enumeration facet used for constraining most primitive datatypes such as strings.

&lt;source lang=XML&gt;
&lt;xs:element name="cardsuit"&gt;
  &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base="xs:string"&gt;
      &lt;xs:enumeration value="Clubs"/&gt;
      &lt;xs:enumeration value="Diamonds"/&gt;
      &lt;xs:enumeration value="Hearts"/&gt;
      &lt;xs:enumeration value="Spades"/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
&lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Ergative–absolutive languages''', or '''ergative languages''' are languages that share a certain distinctive pattern relating to the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] (technically, [[verb argument|arguments]]) of verbs. Examples are [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and several [[Indo-European languages]], such as the [[Kurdish languages]] including [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]]. 

In an ergative language, the single argument ("[[subject (grammar)|subject]]") of an [[intransitive verb]] behaves like the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, and differently from the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]].&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1989), p. 110ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages, such as [[English language|English]] and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She walks.") behaves grammatically like the agent of a transitive verb ("She" in the sentence "She finds it.") but differently from the object of a transitive verb ("him" in the sentence "She likes him.").

In ergative–absolutive languages with [[grammatical case]], the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the [[ergative case|ergative]]. In nominative–accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the [[nominative case|nominative]] while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the [[accusative case|accusative]]. 

There is a variant group, the [[Tripartite language|ergative-accusative languages]] (such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]), which function ergatively with respect to nouns but are nominative-accusative with pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. W. Dixon]], ''Searching for Aboriginal Languages:Memoirs of a Field Worker,'' Cambridge University Press 2011 p.163&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--He says that Dyirbal is nominative-accusative with pronouns, but he doesn't call that pattern "ergative-accusative"--&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

==Ergative vs. accusative languages==

An ergative language maintains a [[syntax|syntactic]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] equivalence (such as the same [[word order]] or [[grammatical case]]) for the object of a transitive verb and the single core argument of an intransitive verb, while treating the agent of a transitive verb differently.

This contrasts with [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] languages such as [[English language|English]], where the single [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of an intransitive verb and the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] of a transitive verb (both called the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of a transitive verb.

{{Clear|left}}

(reference for figure:  &lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;)

These different arguments are usually symbolized as follows:
* '''A''' = agent of transitive verb
* '''O''' = object of transitive verb (also symbolized as '''P''' for "patient")
* '''S''' = core argument of intransitive verb

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="5"
!
! Ergative–absolutive
! Nominative–accusative
|-
| '''A'''
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ERG&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''O'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''S'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt;
|}

''See [[morphosyntactic alignment]] for a more technical explanation and a comparison with [[nominative–accusative language]]s.''

Note that the word ''subject'', as it is typically defined in grammars of nominative–accusative languages, has a different application when referring to ergative–absolutive languages, or when discussing [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in general.

Ergative languages tend to be either verb-final or verb-initial; there are few, if any, ergative [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]-languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~asw/lab/lab87/LAB87_lahne.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realization of ergativity==
Ergativity can be found in both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntactic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;For a kind of "phonological" ergativity, see Rude (1983), also Vydrin (2011) for a detailed critique.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological ergativity===
If the language has morphological [[grammatical case|case]], then the [[verb argument]]s are marked thus:
* The agent of a transitive verb ('''A''') is marked as [[ergative case]], or as a similar case such as [[oblique case|oblique]].
* The core argument of an intransitive verb ('''S''') and the object of a transitive verb ('''O''') are both marked with [[absolutive case]].&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish, UCLA, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no case marking, ergativity can be marked through other means, such as in verbal morphology. For instance, [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and most [[Mayan languages]] have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative–absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most [[markedness|unmarked]] form of a word (exceptions include [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]]&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark (2008). "Semantic alignment systems: what's what, and what's not". In Donohue, Mark &amp; Søren Wichmann, eds. (2008). ''The Typology of Semantic Alignment''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The following examples from [[Basque language|Basque]] demonstrate an ergative–absolutive case marking system:

Here "-Ø" represents a [[Null morpheme|zero morpheme]], as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are "-k" after a vowel, and "-ek" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a [[determiner]]. The default determiner (commonly called the [[Article (grammar)|article]], which is suffixed to [[Noun|common nouns]] and usually translatable by "the" in English) is "-a" in the singular and "-ak" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for "gizon" ("man" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is [[Homophony|homophonous]] with the ergative singular. See [[Basque grammar]] for details.&lt;ref&gt;King, Alan R. ''The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction.'' Reno: University of Nevada Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a nominative–accusative language:

| man &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;NOM&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| child &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
| saw
|-
! Function:
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;intrans&lt;/sub&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;
| VERB&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Translation:
| colspan="2" | "The man arrived."
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan="3" | "The man saw the child."
|}

In this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same [[nominative case]] particle ''ga'', while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the [[accusative case]] o.

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

Accusative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:He (S) traveled.

(S form = A form)

Hypothetical ergative English:

:He (A) found me (O).

:Him (S) traveled.

(S form = O form)

A number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative–accusative marking on verbs and ergative–absolutive case marking on nouns.

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the [[perfective]] aspect (also known as the "aorist [[screeve]]"). Compare:

: ''K'ac'i vašls č'ams.'' (''კაცი ვაშლს ჭამს'') "The man is eating an apple."
:''K'ac''''ma''' vašli č'ama.'' (''კაცმა ვაშლი ჭამა'') "The man ate an apple."

''K'ac'-'' is the root of the word "man". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ''(k'ac'i).'' In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix ''-ma''.

However, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:

:''K'ac''''ma''' daacemina.'' (''კაცმა დააცემინა'') "The man sneezed."

Although the verb ''sneeze'' is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as "sneeze" used to have a direct object (the object being "nose" in the case of "sneeze") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.

===Syntactic ergativity===
Ergativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying “Arrived I” for “I arrived”, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.

Syntactic ergativity may appear in:
* [[Word order]] (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)
* [[Syntactic pivot]]s
* [[Relative clause]]s – determining which arguments are available for relativization
* [[Subordination (linguistics)|Subordination]]
* [[Switch reference]]

#* Father returned and mother saw ____&lt;sub&gt;(i)&lt;/sub&gt;. (ill-formed, because S and deleted O cannot be [[coreference|coreferential]].)

===Split ergativity===
{{main|Split ergativity}}
The term ''ergative–absolutive'' is considered unsatisfactory by some, since there are very few languages without any patterns that exhibit [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative alignment]]. Instead they posit that one should only speak of ''ergative–absolutive systems'', which languages employ to different degrees.

Many languages classified as ergative in fact show '''split ergativity''', whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. [[Basque language|Basque]] is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], though it shows thoroughly nominative–accusative [[Morphosyntactic alignment|syntactic alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/agreementbasque1.pdf. Retrieved 5 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi]], the ergative case is marked on agents in the [[preterite]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses for transitive and [[ditransitive verb]]s, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.

:''laṛkā kitāb kharīdtā hai''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-NOMINATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-IMPERFECT-MASCULINE be-PRESENT&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy buys a book."

:''laṛke ne kitāb kharīdī''
:&lt;tt&gt;boy-ERGATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-PERFECT-FEMININE&lt;/tt&gt; ¹
:"The boy bought a book."

::''(¹) The grammatical analysis has been simplified to show the features relevant to the example.''


In the Northern Kurdish language [[Kurmanji]], the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and "future in the past" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:

In sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.  

In [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.

===Optional ergativity===

Many languages with ergative marking display what is known as ''optional ergativity'', where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly ''optional'' but is affected by [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Note that unlike [[split ergativity]], which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.

Optional ergativity may be motivated by:
* The [[animacy]] of the subject, with more ''animate'' subjects more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[semantics]] of the verb, with more ''active'' or ''transitive'' verbs more likely to be marked ergative
* The [[grammatical structure]] or [tense-aspect-mood]

Languages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (2010) Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective. ''Lingua'' 120: 1610–1636&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of ergative languages==
Prototypical ergative languages are, for the most part, restricted to specific regions of world: the [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), [[Caucasus]], [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|the Americas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and [[Australia]] and parts of [[New Guinea]].

Some specific languages are the following:

'''Americas'''
* [[Chibchan languages]]
* [[Chinook languages]]
* [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskaleut languages]]
* [[Guaicuruan languages]]
* [[Macro-Je languages]]
* [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]
* [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoque]]
* [[Panoan languages]]
* [[Tsimshian languages|Tsimshian]]

'''Africa'''
* [[Päri language|Päri]], although recent studies imply a nominative-accusative system.&lt;ref&gt;Ergativity, by R. M. W. Dixon, Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, vol. 69, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia'''
* [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=WUeWBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=itelmen+language+ergative-absolutive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ygxqwTaYxH&amp;sig=x7I6m3od4Ur5yqeb2X1u9PYyKn0&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXpe_dpOPTAhVGKywKHQBBC2oQ6AEIUDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=itelmen%20language%20ergative-absolutive&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; (endangered)

'''Australian'''
* Most [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]
Certain [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] (e.g., [[Wangkumara]]) possess an [[intransitive case]] and an [[accusative case]] along with an ergative case, and lack an [[absolutive case]]; such languages are called [[ergative–accusative language]]s or [[tripartite language]]s.

'''Sign languages''' −− (for example, [[Nepalese Sign Language#NSL Morhosyntax|Nepali Sign Language]]) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of [[Actant#In linguistics|actant]] incorporation in verbs.&lt;ref&gt;MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s that have been studied, [[classifier handshape]]s are incorporated into verbs, indicating the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verb]]s when incorporated, and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s. (If we follow the "[[Semantic Phonology]]" model proposed by [[William Stokoe]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in [[Nepali Sign Language]] the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a [[manual alphabet]] handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the [[Object (grammar)|object]].)

Many other languages have limited ergativity. In both [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Hindi]] ([[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]), ergative behavior occurs only in the [[preterite]] and [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses, and in the [[Georgian language|Georgian]], ergativity only occurs in the [[perfective]].

The [[Philippine languages]] (e.g., [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) are sometimes considered ergative (Schachter 1976, 1977; Kroeger 1993), however they have also been considered to have their own unique morphosyntactic alignment. See [[Austronesian alignment]].

Several scholars have hypothesized that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was an ergative language. However, this hypothesis is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavant |first=Marc |title=Proto-Indo-European Ergativity... Still To Be Discussed |journal=Poznań Studies in Contemporary Linguistics |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=433–447 |doi=10.2478/v10010-008-0022-y |url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/r26389132nk67172/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximations of ergativity in English==

English has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix "-ee" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:

:"John has retired" → "John is a retiree"
:"John has escaped" → "John is an escapee"

However, with a transitive verb, adding "-ee" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:

:"Susie employs Mike" → "Mike is an employee"
:"Mike has appointed Susie" → "Susie is an appointee"

Etymologically, the sense in which "-ee" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French [[past participle]]s in "-é". This is still the prevalent sense in [[British English]]: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except "escapee" are still marked as "chiefly U.S." by the "[[Oxford English Dictionary]]".

English also has a number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.

When English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition "of" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with "of"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with "by" as in a passive construction):

:"(a dentist) extracts a tooth" → "the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)"
:"(I/The editor) revised the essay" → "(my/the editor's) revision of the essay"
:"(I was surprised that) the water boiled" → "(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water"
:"I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)" → "My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)"

}}'''Evelyn Thomas Butts''' (May 22, 1924 - March 11, 1993) was an [[African Americans|African American]] civil rights activist and politician in [[Virginia]]. She is best known for challenging the [[poll tax]] and took her case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. Butts was part of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]] and later became an influential member of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] politics.

Butts and her lawyer, [[Joseph A.

In [[mathematics]], the '''fundamental theorem of [[Galois theory]]''' is a result that describes the structure of certain types of [[field extension]]s.

In its most basic form, the theorem asserts that given a field extension ''E''/''F'' that is [[finite extension|finite]] and [[Galois extension|Galois]], there is a one-to-one [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]] between its [[intermediate field]]s and [[subgroup]]s of its [[Galois group]]. ([[Intermediate field]]s are fields ''K'' satisfying ''F'' ⊆ ''K'' ⊆ ''E''; they are also called ''subextensions'' of ''E''/''F''.)

==Explicit description of the correspondence==

For finite extensions, the correspondence can be described explicitly as follows.
* For any subgroup ''H'' of Gal(''E''/''F''), the corresponding [[Fixed-point subring|fixed field]], denoted ''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;'', is the set of those elements of ''E'' which are fixed by every automorphism in ''H''.
* For any intermediate field ''K'' of ''E''/''F'', the corresponding subgroup is Aut(''E''/''K''), that is, the set of those automorphisms in Gal(''E''/''F'') which fix every element of ''K''.

The fundamental theorem says that this correspondence is a one-to-one correspondence if (and only if) ''E''/''F'' is a [[Galois extension]].
For example, the topmost field ''E'' corresponds to the trivial subgroup of Gal(''E''/''F''), and the base field ''F'' corresponds to the whole group Gal(''E''/''F'').

The notation Gal(''E''/''F'') is only used for [[Galois extension]]s. If ''E''/''F'' is Galois, then Gal(''E''/''F'') = Aut(''E''/''F''). If ''E''/''F'' is not Galois, then the "correspondence" gives only an injective (but not surjective) map from &lt;math&gt;\{&lt;/math&gt;subgroups of Aut(''E''/''F'')&lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{&lt;/math&gt;subfields of ''E''/''F''&lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt;, and a surjective (but not injective) map in the reverse direction. In particular, if ''E''/''F'' is not Galois, then ''F'' is not the fixed field of any subgroup of Aut(''E''/''F'').

==Properties of the correspondence==

The correspondence has the following useful properties.

* It is ''inclusion-reversing''. The inclusion of subgroups ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' holds if and only if the inclusion of fields ''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' ⊇ ''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds.
* Degrees of extensions are related to orders of groups, in a manner consistent with the inclusion-reversing property. Specifically, if ''H'' is a subgroup of Gal(''E''/''F''), then |''H''| = [''E'':''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;''] and |Gal(''E''/''F'')|/|''H''| = [''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;'':''F''].
* The field ''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[normal extension]] of ''F'' (or, equivalently, Galois extension, since any subextension of a separable extension is separable) if and only if ''H'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of Gal(''E''/''F''). In this case, the restriction of the elements of Gal(''E''/''F'') to ''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;'' induces an [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]] between Gal(''E&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;''/''F'') and the [[quotient group]] Gal(''E''/''F'')/''H''.

== Example 1==
[[File:Lattice diagram of Q adjoin the positive square roots of 2 and 3, its subfields, and Galois groups.svg|thumb|600px|[[Lattice of subgroups]] and subfields]]
Consider the field 

:&lt;math&gt;K = \Q\left (\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3} \right) = \left [\Q(\sqrt{2}) \right ](\sqrt{3}).&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''K''}} is first determined by adjoining {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}, then {{math|{{sqrt|3}}}}, each element of {{math|''K''}} can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( a + b \sqrt{2} \right ) +  \left ( c + d \sqrt{2} \right ) \sqrt{3},\qquad a,b,c,d \in \Q.&lt;/math&gt;

Its Galois group &lt;math&gt;G = \text{Gal}(K/\Q)&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by examining the automorphisms of {{math|''K''}} which fix {{math|''a''}}. Each such automorphism must send {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} to either {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} or {{math|–{{sqrt|2}}}}, and must send {{math|{{sqrt|3}}}} to either {{math|{{sqrt|3}}}} or {{math|–{{sqrt|3}}}} since the permutations in a Galois group can only permute the roots of an irreducible polynomial. Suppose that {{math|''f''}} exchanges {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} and {{math|–{{sqrt|2}}}}, so

:&lt;math&gt;f\left((a+b\sqrt{2})+(c+d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}\right)=(a-b\sqrt{2})+(c-d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}=a-b\sqrt{2}+c\sqrt{3}-d\sqrt{6},&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''g''}} exchanges {{math|{{sqrt|3}}}} and {{math|–{{sqrt|3}}}},  so

:&lt;math&gt;g\left((a+b\sqrt{2})+(c+d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}\right)=(a+b\sqrt{2})-(c+d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}=a+b\sqrt{2}-c\sqrt{3}-d\sqrt{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

These are clearly automorphisms of {{math|''K''}}. There is also the identity automorphism {{math|''e''}} which does not change anything, and the composition of {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} which changes the signs on ''both'' radicals:

:&lt;math&gt;(fg)\left((a+b\sqrt{2})+(c+d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}\right)=(a-b\sqrt{2})-(c-d\sqrt{2})\sqrt{3}=a-b\sqrt{2}-c\sqrt{3}+d\sqrt{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;G = \left\{1, f, g, fg\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''G''}} is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]]. It has five subgroups, each of which correspond via the theorem to a subfield of {{math|''K''}}. 
* The trivial subgroup (containing only the identity element) corresponds to all of {{math|''K''}}.
* The entire group {{math|''G''}} corresponds to the base field &lt;math&gt;\Q.&lt;/math&gt;
* The two-element subgroup {{math|{1, ''f''} }}corresponds to the subfield &lt;math&gt;\Q(\sqrt{3}),&lt;/math&gt; since {{math|''f''}} fixes {{math|{{sqrt|3}}}}.
* The two-element subgroup {{math|{1, ''g''} }}corresponds to the subfield &lt;math&gt;\Q(\sqrt{2}),&lt;/math&gt; again since {{math|''g''}} fixes {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}.
* The two-element subgroup {{math|{1, ''fg''} }}corresponds to the subfield &lt;math&gt;\Q(\sqrt{6}),&lt;/math&gt; since {{math|''fg''}} fixes {{math|{{sqrt|6}}}}.

== Example 2==
[[File:Lattice diagram of Q adjoin a cube root of 2 and a primitive cube root of 1, its subfields, and Galois groups.svg|thumb|600px|[[Lattice of subgroups]] and subfields]]
The following is the simplest case where the Galois group is not abelian.

Consider the [[splitting field]] ''K'' of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3-2&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Q;&lt;/math&gt; that is, &lt;math&gt;K = \Q(\omega, \theta)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- aargggghhhh can't decide whether to assume that ''K'' is a subfield of '''C''' or whether to do it the pure algebraic way :-) - Dmharvey --&gt; where θ is a cube root of 2, and ω is a cube root of 1 (but not 1 itself). For example, if we imagine ''K'' to be inside the field of complex numbers, we may take θ to be the real cube root of 2, and ω to be

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{-1}2 + i\frac{\sqrt3}2.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that the Galois group &lt;math&gt;G=\text{Gal}(K/\Q)&lt;/math&gt; has six elements, and is isomorphic to the group of permutations of three objects. It is generated by (for example) two automorphisms, say ''f'' and ''g'', which are determined by their effect on θ and ω,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = \omega \theta, \quad f(\omega) = \omega,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(\theta) = \theta, \quad g(\omega) = \omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- hmmm might be nice to explain a little more clearly the effect of these automorphisms - Dmharvey --&gt;
and then

:&lt;math&gt;G = \left\{ 1, f, f^2, g, gf, gf^2 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The subgroups of ''G'' and corresponding subfields are as follows:

* As usual, the entire group ''G'' corresponds to the base field &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; and the trivial group {1} corresponds to the whole field ''K''.

* There is a unique subgroup of order 3, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1, f, f^2\}.&lt;/math&gt; The corresponding subfield is &lt;math&gt;\Q(\omega),&lt;/math&gt; which has degree 2 over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; (the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of ω is &lt;math&gt;x^2+x+1&lt;/math&gt;), corresponding to the fact that the subgroup has [[Index of a subgroup|index]] two in ''G''. Also, this subgroup is normal, corresponding to the fact that the subfield is normal over &lt;math&gt;\Q.&lt;/math&gt;

* There are three subgroups of order 2, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1, g\}, \{1, gf\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{1, gf^2\},&lt;/math&gt; corresponding respectively to the three subfields &lt;math&gt;\Q(\theta), \Q(\omega \theta), \Q(\omega^2\theta ).&lt;/math&gt; These subfields have degree 3 over &lt;math&gt;\Q,&lt;/math&gt; again corresponding to the subgroups having [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 3 in ''G''. Note that the subgroups are ''not'' [[normal subgroup|normal]] in ''G'', and this corresponds to the fact that the subfields are ''not'' Galois over &lt;math&gt;\Q.&lt;/math&gt; For example, &lt;math&gt;\Q(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; contains only a single root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^3-2,&lt;/math&gt; so it cannot be [[normal extension|normal]] over &lt;math&gt;\Q.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--would be nice to have a diagram of subgroups and subfields somewhere here!!! - and for the previous example too! - Dmharvey --&gt;

== Example 3==
Let &lt;math&gt;E=\Q(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; be the field of rational functions in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and let

:&lt;math&gt;G = \left\lbrace { \lambda, \frac{1}{1-\lambda}, \frac{\lambda-1}{\lambda}, \frac{1}{\lambda}, \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-1}, 1-\lambda } \right\rbrace \subset {\rm Aut}(E)&lt;/math&gt;

which is a group under composition, isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; (see: [[Cross ratio#Six cross-ratios as M.C3.B6bius_transformations|six cross-ratios]]).
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the fixed field of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;{\rm Gal}(E/F) = G&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then the coefficients of the following polynomial

: &lt;math&gt;P(T) := \prod_{h \in H} (T - h) \in E[T]&lt;/math&gt;

generate the fixed field of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Galois correspondence means that every subfield of &lt;math&gt;E/F&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed this way. For example, if &lt;math&gt;H = \{\lambda, 1-\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt; then the fixed field is &lt;math&gt;\Q( \lambda(1-\lambda))&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;H = \{\lambda, 1/\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt; then the fixed field is &lt;math&gt;\Q(\lambda + 1/\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, one can write &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, the fixed field of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\Q(j)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; as in [[J-invariant#Alternate Expressions]].

Similar examples can be constructed for each of the [[Platonic solid#Symmetry groups|symmetry groups of the platonic solids]] as these also have faithful actions on the [[projective line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1(\Complex)&lt;/math&gt; and hence on &lt;math&gt;\Complex(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

The theorem classifies the intermediate fields of ''E''/''F'' in terms of [[finite group|group theory]]. This translation between intermediate fields and subgroups is key
to showing  that the [[general quintic equation]] is not [[solvable by radicals]] (see [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). One first determines the Galois groups of [[radical extension]]s (extensions of the form ''F''(α) where α is an ''n''-th root of some element of ''F''), and then uses the fundamental theorem to show that solvable extensions correspond to [[solvable group]]s.

Theories such as [[Kummer theory]] and [[class field theory]] are predicated on the fundamental theorem.

==Infinite case==
There is also a version of the fundamental theorem that applies to infinite [[algebraic extension]]s, which are [[normal extension|normal]] and [[separable extension|separable]]. It involves defining a certain [[topological structure]], the [[Krull topology]], on the Galois group; only subgroups that are also [[closed set]]s are relevant in the correspondence.

==Beyond groupthink==
Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group [[decision-making]] models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the [[groupthink]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ggps_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2323226/The_GGPS_Model_Broadening_the_perspective_on_group_problem_solving | title=The GGPS Model: Broadening the perspective on group problem solving | work=Groups at work: Theory and research | date=2001 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | last1=Fuller | first1=Sally R. | last2=Aldag | first2=Ramon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scie/Career/Wisdom/groupthink1.htm | title=Groupthink | work=Psychology Today | date=November 1971 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | pages=43-46, 74-76 | quote=Groupthink is a psychological terminology used to describe the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive ingroup that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.

The symptoms of groupthink arise when the members of decision-making groups become motivated to avoid being too harsh in their judgments of their leaders' or their colleagues' ideas.  People would adopt a soft line of criticism and avoid conflict, even in their own thinking.  At meetings, all members are amiable and seek complete concurrence, which is likely to be recognized erroneously as consensus, on every important issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Victims_of_Groupthink.html?id=FB13AAAAMAAJ | title=Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1972 | isbn=9780395140024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” &lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt; To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research.&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-29328-001 | title=Beyond fiasco: a reappraisal of the groupthink phenomenon and a new model of group decision processes | author=Aldag, R.J. | last2=Fuller | first2=S.R. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=May 1993  | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=533-552 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.533 | quote=...research does not provide convincing support for the validity of the groupthink phenomenon or for the suggestion that groupthink characteristics lead to negative outcomes.

This model incorporates a variety of antecedent conditions, emergent group characteristics, decision process characteristics, and group decision outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model includes elements of [[Irving Janis|Irving Janis's]] original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="decision_making"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment | publisher=Free Press | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1977 | isbn=9780029161609 | last2=Mann | first2=Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the '''GGPS-model''' first.

==The original groupthink model==
Janis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis" /&gt; In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term "groupthink" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.  Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims" /&gt;
All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see [[Groupthink#Symptoms|groupthink symptoms]]).

==The GGPS-model==
The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.
Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:

# The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ”too few alternatives”.  The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ”number of alternatives”. 
# Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc.

===Elements of the GGPS model===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
====Antecedents====

Three sets of [[Antecedent_(logic)|antecedents]] are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.

=====Decision characteristics=====
Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.

''Examples'': whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.

=====Group structure=====
Elements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.

''Examples'': whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of  mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.

=====Decision making context=====
Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.

''Examples'': whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.

====Emergent group characteristics====

The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.

=====Group Perceptions=====
These include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.

=====Group Processes=====
These include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, [[self-censorship]], and use of [[mindguard]]s.

====Decision process characteristics====

Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).

=====Problem identification=====
Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.

''Example'': if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.

=====Alternative generation=====
Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.

''Example'': in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.

=====Evaluation and choice=====
Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.

''Example'': whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.

====Outcomes====

The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.

'''''Decision outcomes''''': include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.

''Example'': if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.

'''''Political outcomes''''': include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.

''Example'': if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.

'''''Affective outcomes''''': include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.

''Example'': whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14558">The '''Government Security Classifications Policy''' (GSCP) is a new system for classifying [[Classified information in the United Kingdom|sensitive government data]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==GPMS==
Historically, the [[Government Protective Marking Scheme]] was used by government bodies in the UK; it divides data into UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET. This system was designed for paper-based records; it is not easily adapted to modern government work and is not widely understood.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications. Page 1. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current classifications==
[[File:Government Security Classifications Policy.png|thumb|The criteria for classifications are being adjusted too, so there is not always a perfect map from layer to layer.]]
The GSCP uses three levels of classification: OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications |date=April 2014 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |edition=Version 1.0 – October 2013 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251480/Government-Security-Classifications-April-2014.pdf |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simpler than the old model and there is no direct relationship between the old and new classifications. "Unclassified" is deliberately omitted from the new model. Government bodies are not expected to automatically remark existing data, so there may be cases where organisations working under the new system still handle some data marked according to the old system.

Information Asset Owners continue to be responsible for information. The new policy does not specify particular IT security requirements - IT systems should be built and used in accordance with existing guidance from [[Communications-Electronics Security Group|CESG]].&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 2: Managing Information Risk at OFFICIAL. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Everybody who works with government - including contractors and suppliers - is responsible for protecting information they work with, regardless of whether it has a protective marking.

Aggregation does not automatically trigger an increase in protective marking. For instance, a database with thousands of records which are individually OFFICIAL should not be relabeled as a SECRET database. Instead, information owners are expected to make decisions about [[Security controls|controls]] based on a [[risk assessment]], and should consider what the aggregated information is, [[Need to know|who needs to access]] it, and how.

===OFFICIAL===
OFFICIAL includes most public-sector data, including a wide range of information on day-to-day government business. It is not subject to any special risks. Personal data would usually be OFFICIAL.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Government Security Classifications, Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The data should be protected by [[Security control|controls]] based on commercial best practice instead of expensive, difficult specialist technology and bureaucracy. There is no requirement to mark every document as "OFFICIAL" - it is understood that this is the default for government documents.&lt;ref name=HMG_Work_Off&gt; {{cite book |title=Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information |date=April 2013 |publisher=HMG Cabinet Office |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251475/FAQ1-Working-with-Official-Information-v1.2-Apr-2013.pdf}}Government Security Classifications FAQ Sheet 1: Working with OFFICIAL Information. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations may add "descriptors" to highlight particular types of official data, for instance commercially sensitive information about contracts, or diplomatic data which should not be seen by locally hired embassy staff. These descriptors do not automatically require special controls. "OFFICIAL" will usually include the kinds of data that were previously UNCLASSIFIED, RESTRICTED, or CONFIDENTIAL; but this may vary.

The threat model for OFFICIAL data is similar to typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that individual hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to OFFICIAL information should be subject to [[BPSS]] screening.

OFFICIAL may include data which is subject to separate regulatory requirements, such as the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] (personal data) or [[PCI DSS]] (card payments).

====OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE====
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE is an additional caveat for OFFICIAL data where it is particularly important to enforce [[need to know]] rules. OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE documents should be marked, but they are not necessarily tracked.

===SECRET===
"Very sensitive information", which might (for example) seriously harm national defense or crime investigations. Data should only be marked as SECRET if the Senior Information Risk Owner (which is a board level position in an organisation) agrees that it is high-impact ''and'' that the data must be protected against very capable attackers. Although some specialist technology might be used to protect the data, there is still strong emphasis on reuse of commercial security tools.

SECRET is a big step up from OFFICIAL; government bodies are warned against being overcautious and applying much stricter rules when OFFICIAL would be sufficient.

People with routine access to SECRET information should usually have [[SC clearance]]. SECRET data may often be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure.

===TOP SECRET===
Data with exceptionally high impact levels; compromise would have very serious impacts - for instance, many deaths. This requires an extremely high level of protection, and controls are expected to be similar to those used on existing "Top Secret" data, including CESG-approved products. Very little risk can be tolerated in TOP SECRET, although no activity is completely risk-free.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

People with routine access to TOP SECRET information should usually have [[DV clearance]]. TOP SECRET information is assumed to be exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|FOIA]] disclosure. Disclosure of such information is assumed to be above the threshold for [[Official Secrets Act]] prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Government Security Classifications: Security Controls Framework, page 19. Cabinet Office, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special handling instructions===
Special handling instructions are additional markings which used in conjunction with a classification marking to indicate the nature or source of its content, limit access to designated groups, and / or to signify the need for enhanced handling measures.  In addition to a paragraph near the start of the document special handling instructions include Descriptors, Codewords, Prefixes and national caveats.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Descriptors====
A DESCRIPTOR is used with the security classification to identify certain categories of sensitive information and indicates the need for common sense precautions to limit access.  The normal descriptors are 'COMMERCIAL’, 'LOCSEN’ and 'PERSONAL’.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Codewords====
A Codeword is a single word expressed in CAPITAL letters that follows the security classification to providing security cover for a particular asset or event. They are usually only applied to SECRET and TOP SECRET assets.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

====Prefixes and national caveats====
The UK prefix is added to the security classification of all assets sent to foreign governments or international organisations.  This prefix designates the UK as the originating country and that the British Government should be consulted before any possible disclosure.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

National caveats follow the security classification. Unless explicitly named, information bearing a national caveat is not sent to foreign governments, overseas contractors, international organisations or released to any foreign nationals.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;  Example
::::‘TOP SECRET – UK / US EYES ONLY’
With the exception of British Embassies and Diplomatic Missions or Service units or establishments, assets bearing the UK EYES ONLY national caveat are not sent overseas.&lt;ref name=HMG_Sec_Class/&gt;

==New approach to handling classified information==
As per the previous GPMS model, the choice of classification relates only to the data's confidentiality.
Unlike the old model it replaces however, the GSCP does not consider the consequence of a compromise as the primary factor, but instead is based on the capability and motivation of potential threat actors (attackers) and the acceptability of that risk to the business.

Where a capable and motivated attacker such as a Foreign Intelligence Service, or Serious and Organised Crime are considered to be in scope of the data to be classified, the business must implicitly accept this risk to classify the data as OFFICIAL.
If they do not or cannot accept this risk they must at least initially consider the data to be SECRET, though it may be reduced to OFFICIAL or increased to TOP SECRET later when the consequences of a compromise are also considered.

The implication of this approach and the binary nature of determining if a risk from capable and motivated attackers is acceptable or not, means that data cannot easily progress through the GSCP in a linear fashion as it did through GPMS. 

This is a complexity often lost on Information Asset Owners previously used to the strictly hierarchical tiered rising structure of GPMS  (e.g. UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET).

By contrast GSCP data starts either with an OFFICIAL '''OR''' SECRET classification depending on the nature of threat and its acceptability to the business, and thereafter moves up or down accordingly based on consequence of compromise.

OFFICIAL data may therefore rise to TOP SECRET, but cannot be SECRET unless the risk previously accepted for a capable attacker is revised.

SECRET data may be reduced to OFFICIAL where no serious consequences can be identified from a potential breach, or SECRET can also rise to TOP SECRET if serious consequences could arise. 

Impact levels also consider integrity and availability, but CESG's system of Business Impact Levels (BIL) is under review too and in most practical contexts have now fallen into disuse. 

It is therefore no longer strictly the case that the greater the consequences if the data confidentiality were to be compromised, the higher the classification, since data with a high impact (including material which could result in threat to life) may still be classified as OFFICIAL if the relevant business owner believes it is not necessary to protect this from an attacker who has the capabilities of a Foreign Intelligence Service or Serious and Organised Crime.

Conversely some data with much lower consequences (for example ongoing Police investigations into a criminal group, or intelligence information relating to possible prosecutions) but where the business will not accept compromise from such an attacker could be classified as SECRET.

Guidance issued in April 2014 at the implementation of the GSCP and still available on Gov.UK sources &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications&lt;/ref&gt;suggested that UK Government information systems would continue to be accredited much as before, normally using CESG [[Information Assurance Standard 1 &amp; 2]]. 
This has however been progressively discarded through GDS and NCSC blog statements since May 2014 and the IS1 &amp; 2 standard itself is no longer maintained or mandated.
Accreditation has also been largely replaced by alternative models of assurance aligned to various commercial practices. 

The NAO report "Protecting Information across Government" (Sep 2016) was somewhat critical of the move to this model and the adoption of GSCP overall &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nao.org.uk/report/protecting-information-across-government/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Existing published guidance continues to suggest that storage media which hold UK government data should still be destroyed or purged according to [[HMG IA Policy No. 5]], however terminology in this guidance and other material has not been updated fully to reflect the changes from GPMS protective markings to GSCP classifications and as such its value is now arguably somewhat reduced as a published standard.

Higher classifications still tend to require stricter [[Security vetting in the United Kingdom|personnel vetting]].

==History==
The Government Security Classifications Policy was completed and published in December 2012; additional guidance and supporting processes were developed over time.

Government bodies (and the armed forces) were expected to start using the GSCP in April 2014.

[[File:Map_of_the_Interior_World.png|thumb|upright=1.4|A cross-sectional drawing of the planet Earth showing the "Interior World" of Atvatabar, from [[William R. Bradshaw]]'s 1892 science-fiction novel ''The Goddess of Atvatabar'']]
The '''Hollow Earth''' is a historical concept proposing that the planet [[Earth]] is entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space. 
Notably suggested by [[Edmond Halley]] in the late 17th century, the notion was tentatively disproven by [[Pierre Bouguer]] in 1740, and definitely by [[Charles Hutton]] (1778).

It was still occasionally defended in the early-to-mid 19th century, notably by [[John Cleves Symmes Jr.]] and [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]], but by this time was part of popular [[pseudoscience]] and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis.

The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in [[folklore]] and as the premise for [[subterranean fiction]], and a subgenre of [[adventure fiction]] (''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'').

==Hypothesis==
&lt;!-- Reliable sources would be appreciated for much of this material. --&gt;

In ancient times, the concept of a subterranean land inside the Earth appeared in [[mythology]], [[folklore]] and [[legend]]s. The idea of subterranean realms seemed arguable, and became intertwined with the concept of "places" of origin or afterlife, such as the [[Greek underworld]], the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Svartálfaheimr]], the Christian [[Hell]], and the Jewish [[Sheol]] (with details describing inner Earth in [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] literature, such as the [[Zohar]] and [[Avraham Azulai|Hesed L'Avraham]]). The idea of a subterranean realm is also mentioned in [[Tibetan Buddhist]] belief.&lt;ref&gt;Hollow Earth in the Puranas [http://holloworbs.com/HE_Puranas_Article.htm Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Way to Shambhala, Edwin Bernbaum, Anchor Books; 1st edition, 1980 {{ISBN|0-385-12794-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one story from Tibetan Buddhist tradition, there is an ancient city called [[Shamballa]] which is located inside the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], there were [[caverns]] under the surface which were entrances leading to the [[underworld]], some of which were the caverns at [[Tainaron]] in [[Lakonia]], at [[Troezen]] in [[Argolis]], at Ephya in [[Thesprotia]], at Herakleia in [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]], and in [[Ermioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | volume = 1 | year = 1916 | first = William | last = Sherwood Fox | authorlink = William Sherwood Fox | title = Greek and Roman | url = https://archive.org/details/mythologyofallra11gray_0 | page=  143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thracians|Thracian]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] legends, it is said that there are underground [[Environmental chamber|chambers]] occupied by an ancient god called [[Zalmoxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, Zalmoxis, the vanishing God: comparative studies in the religions and folklore of Dacia and Eastern Europe, 1959, pp. 24–30&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesopotamian religion]] there is a story of a man who, after traveling through the darkness of a tunnel in the mountain of "Mashu", entered a subterranean garden.&lt;ref&gt;Myth: its meaning and functions in ancient and other cultures, G. S. Kirk, 1970, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Station Island.jpg|thumb|Chapel, bell tower and penitential beds on [[Station Island]]. The bell tower stands on a mound that is the site of a cave which, according to various myths, is an entrance to a place of [[purgatory]] inside the Earth. The cave has been closed since October 25, 1632.]]

In [[Celtic mythology]] there is a legend of a cave called "[[Cruachan, Ireland|Cruachan]]", also known as "Ireland's gate to Hell", a mythical and ancient cave from which according to legend strange creatures would emerge and be seen on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;John A MacCulloch, Celtic Mythology, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Pub Inc, 1932, pp. 125–26&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stories of [[medieval]] [[knights]] and [[saints]] who went on [[pilgrimages]] to a cave located in [[Station Island]], [[County Donegal]] in Ireland, where they made journeys inside the Earth into a place of [[purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Write, Saint Patrick's Purgatory : A medieval Pilgrimage in Ireland, 1918, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In [[County Down]], Northern Ireland there is a myth which says tunnels lead to the land of the subterranean [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], a group of people who are believed to have introduced [[Druidism]] to Ireland, and then went back underground.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bayley, Archaic England: An Essay in Deciphering Prehistory from Megalithic Monuments, 1919 Online Edition: [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHD5DFeFTZ0C&amp;pg=PA766&amp;dq=Bayley,+Harold+-+ARCHAIC+ENGLAND+county+down&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bT1zToD-Js6bOpfSrb0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu mythology, the underworld is referred to as [[Patala]]. In the Bengali version of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], it has been depicted how [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] were taken by the king of the underworld [[Ahiravan]], brother of the demon king [[Ravana]]. Later on they were rescued by [[Hanuman]]. The [[Angami Naga]] tribes of [[India]] claim that their ancestors emerged in ancient times from a subterranean land inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Angami NagaBrown, Account of Munnipore, 1968., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taíno people|Taino]] from Cuba believe their ancestors emerged in ancient times from two caves in a mountain underground.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Russell Emerson, Indian Myths, 1965 "It is to the Cubans we are indebted for the following version of man's origin: It was from the depths of a deep cavern in the earth that mankind issued."&lt;/ref&gt;

Natives of the [[Trobriand Islands]] believe that their ancestors had come from a subterranean land through a cavern hole called "Obukula".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Freund, Myths of Creation; 1965, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican folklore also tells of a cave in a mountain five miles south of [[Ojinaga]], and that Mexico is possessed by devilish creatures who came from inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;George, Wally&amp;nbsp;– Pilgrimage To The Devil., Article in Fate magazine, Aug. 1957, pp. 38–52&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[middle ages]], an ancient German myth held that some mountains located between [[Eisenach]] and [[Gotha (town)|Gin Germany]] hold a portal to the inner Earth. A Russian legend says the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]], an ancient [[Siberian]] [[tribe]], traveled to an underground cavern city to live inside the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Clark B Firestone and Ruth Hambidge, The Coasts of Ilusion, Harper &amp; Bros; First Edition, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian writer [[Dante]] describes a hollow earth in his well-known 14th century work ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', in which the fall of Lucifer from heaven caused an enormous funnel to appear in a previously solid and spherical earth, as well as an enormous mountain opposite it, "Purgatory".

[[File:Hollow Earth.svg|thumb|150px|[[Edmond Halley]]'s hypothesis.]]

[[Edmond Halley]] in 1692&lt;ref name="halley"&gt;Halley, Edmond, ''An Account of the cause of the Change of the Variation of the Magnetic Needle; with an Hypothesis of the Structure of the Internal Parts of the Earth'', Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London, No. 195, 1692, pp 563–578&lt;/ref&gt; put forth the idea of Earth consisting of a hollow shell about {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, two inner concentric shells and an innermost core. Atmospheres separate these shells, and each shell has its own magnetic poles. The spheres rotate at different speeds. Halley proposed this scheme in order to explain anomalous compass readings. He envisaged the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] inside as [[luminosity|luminous]] (and possibly inhabited) and speculated that escaping gas caused the [[Aurora Borealis]].&lt;ref name="halley2"&gt;Halley, Edmond, ''An Account of the Late Surprizing Appearance of the Lights Seen in the Air, on the Sixth of March Last; With an Attempt to Explain the Principal Phaenomena thereof;'', Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London, No. 347 (1716), pp. 406–28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Sprague de Camp|De Camp]] and [[Willy Ley|Ley]] have claimed (in their ''[[Lands Beyond]]'') that [[Leonhard Euler]] also proposed a hollow-Earth idea, getting rid of multiple shells and postulating an interior sun {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} across to provide light to advanced inner-Earth civilizations but they provide no references; indeed, Euler did not propose a hollow-Earth, but there is a slightly related [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/euler/How%20Euler%20Did%20It%2042%20Hollow%20earth.pdf Euler and the Hollow Earth: Fact or Fiction?]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp and Ley also claim that [[Sir John Leslie]] expanded on Euler's idea, suggesting two central suns named Pluto and Proserpine (this was unrelated to the planet [[Pluto]], which was discovered and named a century later). Leslie did propose a hollow Earth in his 1829 ''Elements of Natural Philosophy'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;449–53), but does not mention interior suns. Jules Verne alludes to the Pluto-Proserpine theory, which he attributes to "an English captain", in ''Journey to the Center of the Earth.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weblitera.com/sync/?id=111&amp;l1=4&amp;l2=1&amp;ch=30&amp;l=en#.Wc6Gb4qQx3k&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Le Clerc Milfort]] in 1781 led a journey with hundreds of [[Creek Indians]] to a series of [[caverns]] near the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] above the junction of the [[Mississippi River]]. According to Milfort the original Creek Indian ancestors are believed to have emerged out to the surface of the Earth in ancient times from the caverns. Milfort also claimed the caverns they saw "could easily contain 15,000&amp;nbsp;– 20,000 families."&lt;ref&gt;Migration Legend of the Creek Indians, Volumes 1–2, Albert S. Gatschet, Ams Pr Inc, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franco-American review, Volumes 1–2, the Yale University Press, 1938, p. 111. Also see The Venus Calendar Observatory at Aztec New Mexico, Allan Macgillivray III, 2010, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1818, [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.]] suggested that the Earth consisted of a hollow shell about {{convert|1300|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, with openings about {{convert|2300|km|mi|abbr=on}} across at both [[geographical pole|poles]] with 4 inner shells each open at the poles. Symmes became the most famous of the early Hollow Earth proponents, and [[Hamilton, Ohio]], even has a monument to him and his ideas.&lt;ref name="atlasobscura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hollow-earth-monument |title=Hollow Earth Monument &amp;#124; Atlas Obscura: John Symmes Hollow Earth monument |publisher=atlasobscura.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed making an expedition to the [[North Pole]] hole, thanks to efforts of one of his followers, [[James McBride (pioneer)|James McBride]].

[[Jeremiah N. Reynolds|Jeremiah Reynolds]] also delivered lectures on the "Hollow Earth" and argued for an expedition. Reynolds went on an expedition to Antarctica himself but missed joining the [[Wilkes Expedition|Great U.S. Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–1842, even though that venture was a result of his agitation.

Though Symmes himself never wrote a book about his ideas, several authors' published works discussing his ideas. McBride wrote ''Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres'' in 1826. It appears that Reynolds has an article that appeared as a separate booklet in 1827: ''Remarks of Symmes' Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review.'' In 1868, a professor W.F. Lyons published ''The Hollow Globe'' which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth hypothesis, but failed to mention Symmes himself. Symmes's son Americus then published ''The Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres'' in 1878 to set the record straight.

[[William Fairfield Warren]], in his book ''Paradise Found–The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole,'' (1885) presented his belief that humanity originated on a continent in the Arctic called [[Hyperborea]]. This influenced some early Hollow Earth proponents. According to Marshall Gardner, both the [[Eskimo]] and [[Mongolian peoples]] had come from the interior of the Earth through an entrance at the [[North pole]].&lt;ref&gt;A Journey to the Earth's Interior, Marshall Gardner, Mokelumne Hill Pr, 1974 Edition, {{ISBN|0-7873-1192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===20th century===

''[[NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages]]'', first serialized in a newspaper printed in Topeka, Kansas in 1900 and considered an early feminist utopian novel, mentions John Cleves Symmes' theory as an explanation for the hollow Earth they sail into.

An early twentieth-century proponent of hollow Earth, William Reed, wrote ''[[Phantom of the Poles]]'' in 1906. He supported the idea of a hollow Earth, but without interior shells or inner sun.

The [[spiritualist]] writer [[Walburga, Lady Paget]] in her book ''Colloquies with an unseen friend'' (1907) was an early writer to mention the hollow Earth hypothesis. She claimed that cities exist beneath a desert, which is where the people of [[Atlantis]] moved. She said an entrance to the subterranean kingdom will be discovered in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Paget Walburga, Colloquies with an unseen friend, William Rider &amp; Son., London., 1909., p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall Gardner wrote ''A Journey to the Earth's Interior'' in 1913 and published an expanded edition in 1920. He placed an interior sun in the Earth and built a working model of the Hollow Earth which he patented ({{US patent|1096102}}). Gardner made no mention of Reed, but did criticize Symmes for his ideas. Around the same time, [[Vladimir Obruchev]] wrote a novel titled ''Plutonia'', in which the Hollow Earth possessed an inner Sun and was inhabited by prehistoric species. The interior was connected with the surface by an opening in the [[Arctic]].

The explorer [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski|Ferdynand Ossendowski]] wrote a book in 1922 titled ''Beasts, Men and Gods''. Ossendowski said he was told about a subterranean kingdom that exists inside the Earth. It was known to [[Buddhists]] as [[Agartha|Agharti]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdynand Ossendowski (1922). Beasts, Men and Gods. New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Papashvily]] in his ''Anything Can Happen'' (1940) claimed the discovery in the [[Caucasus mountains]] of a cavern containing human [[skeletons]] "with heads as big as bushel baskets" and an ancient tunnel leading to the centre of the Earth. One man entered the tunnel and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;George &amp; Helen Papashvily,&amp;nbsp;– Anything Can Happen., Harper &amp; Bros., New York, NY., 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Lobsang Rampa]] in his book ''The Cave of the Ancients'' said an underground chamber system exists beneath the [[Himalayas]] of [[Tibet]], filled with ancient [[machinery]], [[Document|records]] and treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Cave of the Ancients, Lobsang Rampa, Random House, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Grumley]], a [[cryptozoologist]], has linked [[Bigfoot]] and other [[hominid]] [[cryptids]] to ancient tunnel systems [[:wikt:underground|underground]].&lt;ref&gt;There are Giants in the Earth, Michael Grumley, Panther Books, 1976, pp. 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[ancient astronaut]] writer [[Peter Kolosimo]] a robot was seen entering a subterranean tunnel below a [[monastery]] in Mongolia. Kolosimo also claimed a light was seen from underground in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kolosimo]], Not of this World, Sphere Books 1974 {{ISBN|0-7221-5309-0}} also see Peter Kolosimo, Timeless Earth, Citadel Pr, 1988 Edition {{ISBN|0-8065-1070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolosimo and other ancient astronaut writers such as [[Robert Charroux]] linked these activities to UFOs.

A book by a "Dr. [[Raymond W. Bernard|Raymond Bernard]]" which appeared in 1964, ''The Hollow Earth'', exemplifies the idea of UFOs coming from inside the earth, and adds the idea that the [[Ring Nebula]] proves the existence of hollow worlds, as well as speculation on the fate of [[Atlantis]] and the origin of flying saucers.&lt;ref name="reece"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Reece  | first =Gregory L. | title =UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture   | publisher =I.

The science fiction [[pulp magazine]] ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' promoted one such idea from 1945 to 1949 as "the Shaver Mystery". The magazine's editor, [[Raymond A. Palmer|Ray Palmer]], ran a series of stories by [[Richard Sharpe Shaver]], claiming that a superior pre-historic race had built a [[honeycomb]] of caves in the Earth, and that their degenerate descendants, known as "Dero", live there still, using the fantastic machines abandoned by the ancient races to torment those of us living on the surface. As one characteristic of this torment, Shaver described "voices" that purportedly came from no explainable source. Thousands of readers wrote to affirm that they, too, had heard the fiendish voices from inside the Earth. The writer [[David Hatcher Childress]] authored ''Lost Continents and the Hollow Earth'' (1998) in which he reprinted the stories of Palmer and defended the Hollow Earth idea based on alleged tunnel systems beneath South America and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hatcher Childress]] ''Lost Continents and the Hollow Earth ''Adventures Unlimited Press, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0932813633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollow Earth proponents have claimed a number of different locations for the entrances which lead inside the Earth. Other than the North and South poles, entrances in locations which have been cited include: Paris in France,&lt;ref&gt;Alien races and Fantastic Civilizations., Serge Hutin, Berkeley Medallion Books, 1975, pp. 109–132&amp;nbsp;– In the Bowels of the Earth: Refers to the mysterious catacombs beneath Paris, and other underground mysteries which lead inside the Earth.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Staffordshire]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;The Under-People, Eric Norman, Award Books, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Inner Earth People And Outer Space People, William L.

=== Concave Hollow Earths ===
[[File:Concave hollow Earths.svg|thumb|200px|An example of a concave hollow Earth. Humans live on the interior, with the universe in the center]]

Instead of saying that humans live on the outside surface of a hollow planet—sometimes called a "convex" Hollow Earth hypothesis—some have claimed humans live on the ''inside'' surface of a hollow [[spherical]] world, so that our universe itself lies in that world's interior. This has been called the "concave" Hollow Earth hypothesis or skycentrism.

[[Cyrus Teed]], a doctor from upstate New York, proposed such a concave Hollow Earth in 1869, calling his scheme "Cellular Cosmogony".&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/fantastically-wrong-hollow-earth/ |title=Fantastically Wrong: The Legendary Scientist Who Swore Our Planet Is Hollow &amp;#124; WIRED |publisher=wired.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teed founded a group called the [[Koreshan Unity]] based on this notion, which he called [[Koreshanity]]. The main colony survives as a preserved Florida state historic site, at [[Estero, Florida]], but all of Teed's followers have now died. Teed's followers claimed to have experimentally verified the concavity of the Earth's curvature, through surveys of the Florida coastline making use of "rectilineator" equipment.

Several twentieth-century German writers, including Peter Bender, Johannes Lang, Karl Neupert, and Fritz Braut, published works advocating the Hollow Earth hypothesis, or ''Hohlweltlehre''. It has even been reported, although apparently without historical documentation, that Adolf Hitler was influenced by concave Hollow Earth ideas and sent an expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to spy on the British fleet by pointing infrared cameras up at the sky.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Egypt]]ian mathematician [[Mostafa A. Abdelkader|Mostafa Abdelkader]] wrote several scholarly papers working out a detailed mapping of the Concave Earth model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M.|last=Abdelkader|title=A Geocosmos: Mapping Outer Space Into a Hollow Earth|issue=6|journal=Speculations in Science &amp; Technology|pages=81–89|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Notices of the American Mathematical Society,'' (Oct. 1981 and Feb. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In one chapter of his book ''On the Wild Side'' (1992), [[Martin Gardner]] discusses the Hollow Earth model articulated by Abdelkader. According to Gardner, this hypothesis posits that light rays travel in circular paths, and slow as they approach the center of the spherical star-filled cavern. No energy can reach the center of the cavern, which corresponds to no point a finite distance away from Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. A drill, Gardner says, would lengthen as it traveled away from the cavern and eventually pass through the "point at infinity" corresponding to the center of the Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. Supposedly no experiment can distinguish between the two cosmologies.

Gardner notes that "most mathematicians believe that an inside-out universe, with properly adjusted physical laws, is empirically irrefutable". Gardner rejects the concave Hollow Earth hypothesis on the basis of [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref&gt;''On the Wild Side'' (1992), Martin Gardner, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Purportedly verifiable hypotheses of a "Concave Hollow Earth" need to be distinguished from a thought experiment
which defines a [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)|coordinate]] transformation such that the interior of the Earth becomes "exterior" and the exterior becomes "interior". (For example, in spherical coordinates, let radius ''r'' go to ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''r'' where ''R'' is the Earth's radius.) The transformation entails corresponding changes to the forms of physical laws. This is not a hypothesis but an illustration of the fact that any description of the physical world can be equivalently expressed in more than one way.&lt;ref name="gardnertransformation"&gt;On the Wild Side, 1992, [[Martin Gardner]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The time it takes for seismic waves to travel through and around the Earth directly contradicts a hollow sphere. The evidence indicates that the Earth is filled with solid rock (mantle and crust), liquid nickel-iron alloy (outer core), and solid nickel-iron (inner core).&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/interior/ |title=The Interior of the Earth |publisher=pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravity ===
{{main|Schiehallion experiment|Cavendish experiment}}
Another set of scientific arguments against a Hollow Earth or any hollow planet comes from [[gravity]]. Massive objects tend to clump together gravitationally, creating non-hollow spherical objects such as stars and planets. The solid sphere is the best way in which to minimize the [[gravitational potential energy]] of a physical object; having hollowness is unfavorable in the energetic sense. In addition, ordinary matter is not strong enough to support a hollow shape of planetary size against the force of gravity; a planet-sized hollow shell with the known, observed thickness of the Earth's crust would not be able to achieve [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] with its own mass and would collapse.

Based upon the size of the Earth and the force of gravity on its surface, the average density of the planet Earth is 5.515&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and typical densities of surface rocks are only half that (about 2.75&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). If any significant portion of the Earth were hollow, the average density would be much lower than that of surface rocks. The only way for Earth to have the force of gravity that it does is for much more dense material to make up a large part of the interior. Nickel-iron alloy under the conditions expected in a non-hollow Earth would have densities ranging from about 10 to 13&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which brings the average density of Earth to its observed value.

=== Direct observation ===
Drilling holes does not provide direct evidence against the hypothesis. The deepest hole drilled to date is the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iflscience.com/environment/deepest-hole-world/|title=What's At The Bottom Of The Deepest Hole On Earth?|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a true vertical drill-depth of more than 7.5 miles (12 kilometers). However, the distance to the center of the Earth is nearly 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers). Oil wells with longer depths are not vertical wells; the total depths quoted are measured depth (MD) or equivalently, along-hole depth (AHD) as these wells are deviated to horizontal. Their true vertical depth (TVD) are typically less than 4000 m.

==In fiction==
{{Main|Subterranean fiction}}

The idea of a hollow Earth is a common element of fiction, appearing as early as [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s 1741 novel ''Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum'' ([[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]), in which Nicolai Klim falls through a cave while spelunking and spends several years living on a smaller globe both within and the inside of the outer shell.

Other notable pre-20th century examples include [[Giacomo Casanova]]'s 1788 ''Icosaméron'', a 5-volume, 1,800-page story of a brother and sister who fall into the Earth and discover the subterranean utopia of the Mégamicres, a race of multicolored, hermaphroditic dwarves; ''[[Symzonia: A Voyage of Discovery]]'' by a "Captain Adam Seaborn" (1820) which reflected the ideas of John Cleves Symmes, Jr.; [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1838 novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]];'' [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]],'' which described a prehistoric subterranean world; and [[George Sand]]'s 1864 novel ''Laura, Voyage dans le Cristal'' where unseen and giant [[crystal]]s could be found in the interior of the Earth.

In [[William Henry Hudson]]'s [[1887 in literature|1887]] romance, ''[[A Crystal Age]]'', the protagonist falls down a hill into a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|Utopian]], [[Asexuality|asexual]], [[pastoral]] [[paradise]]; since he falls into this world, it is sometimes classified as a hollow Earth story; although the hero himself thinks he may have [[Time travel in fiction|traveled forward in time]] by millennia.

The idea was used by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the creator of [[Tarzan]], in the seven-novel "[[Pellucidar]]" series, beginning with ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'' (1914). Using a mechanical drill, his heroes discover a prehistoric world, called Pellucidar, 500 miles below the surface, that is lit by an inner sun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000816193019/http://www.literature.org/authors/burroughs-edgar-rice/at-the-earths-core/ At the Earth's Core], by Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/ref&gt; The 1915 novel ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]] ''by [[Vladimir Obruchev]] uses the concept of the hollow Earth to take the reader through various geological epochs.

In recent decades, the idea has become a staple of the science fiction and adventure genres, appearing in print; in film, notably as the premise for the creatures in ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]''; on television programs such as ''[[Sanctuary (TV series)|Sanctuary]]'', where Hollow Earth formed the core of the story arcs of the third and fourth seasons; in comics; in [[role-playing game]]s, such as the [[Hollow World Campaign Set]] for [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]; in video games like ''[[Gears of War]]'', where humans live on an Earth-like planet with a mostly hollow interior; and in many animated works, such as [[Torin's Passage]], where the hero must travel to the "lands below" to rescue his family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20367">In [[law]], [[economics]] and the [[social sciences]], '''inequality of bargaining power''' is where one party to a "bargain", [[contract]] or agreement, has more and better alternatives than the other party. This results in one party having greater "power" than the other to choose not to take the deal and makes it more likely that this party will gain more favourable terms. Inequality of bargaining power is where some believe that [[freedom of contract]] ceases to be real freedom, or that some have more freedom than others, and that it represents a place at which [[Market failure|markets fail]].

Where [[bargaining power]] is persistently unequal, the concept of inequality of bargaining power serves as a justification for the implication of mandatory terms into contracts by law, or the non-enforcement of a contract by the courts.

==Historical development==
The concept of inequality of bargaining power was long recognised, particularly with regard to workers. In the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' [[Adam Smith]] wrote,

{{Cquote|It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides, authorizes, or at least does not prohibit their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Beatrice Webb]] and [[Sidney Webb]] in their treatise ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' significantly expanded on the critique of 19th century labour conditions and advocated a comprehensive system of [[labour law]] contained a chapter called, "The Higgling of the Market". They argued that the labour market was dominated by employers, and therefore had the same effect as [[monopsony]]. Workers generally are more under pressure to sell their labour than an employer is under to buy it. An employer can hold out longer, because typically he will have greater financial reserves. This means that much labour is supplied merely out of necessity, than free choice (shifting the supply curve to the right) and it is a false kind of competitive environment. The Webbs also pointed out that discrimination can decrease job opportunities for women or minorities, and that the legal institutions underpinning the market were skewed in favour of employers. Most importantly, they believed that a large pool of unemployed people was a constant downward drag on the ability of workers to bargain for better conditions.

{{Cquote|When the unemployed are crowding round the factory gates every morning, it is plain to each man that, unless he can induce the foreman to select him rather than another, his chance of subsistence for weeks to come may be irretrievably lost. Under these circumstances bargaining, in the case of the individual isolated workmen, becomes absolutely impossible.&lt;ref&gt;S Webb and B Webb, ''Industrial Democracy'' (1897) 660&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Webbs felt that these factors all added up to systemic inequality of bargaining power between workers and employers. The first ever use of the phrase "inequality of bargaining power", however, appears to have been by the British philosopher, [[John Beattie Crozier]] in ''The Wheel of Wealth''.&lt;ref&gt;JB Crozier, ''The Wheel of Wealth; Being a Reconstruction of the Science and Art of Political Economy on the Lines'' (1906) Part III, ch 2, ‘On the tendency to inequality’, 377,&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|There must always be an inequality of bargaining power between masters and men in every contract, until that day shall arrive when the sacrifices of each master in a strike or lock out will affect his present comfort and future destiny as seriously, in its way, as it does that of each of his workmen.}}

"The real measure of market power is not whether a supplier presents his terms on a take-it-or-leave basis but whether the consumer, if he decides to ‘leave it’ has available to him a workably competitive range of alternative sources of supply. Whether this is or is not so simply cannot be derived intuitively from the fact that a particular supplier is offering non-negotiable standard-form terms. It is a matter for independent inquiry. If the market is workably competitive, any supplier offering uncompetitive standard form terms will have to reformulate his total package of price and non-price terms to prevent consumers (at least consumers at the margin, which are the decisive consideration in such a market) from switching their business to other competitors....

Non-economists often overlook the importance of marginal analysis in this context. For example, if only 10 per cent of the buyers of insurance policies or dry-cleaning services studied all terms scrupulously before contracting an were influence in their choice of policy by their evaluation of the so-called fine print clauses, and if no supplier of insurance or dry-cleaning services was able to ‘term discriminate’ between these consumers and other consumers in the market, there would be strong competitive pressures on each supplier to adjust the terms of his contracts so as to avoid losing this potential business....

When one asks why, many consumers probably rely in part on the constraints imposed by other consumers at the margin (ie, they let the market shop for them)."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The point is obvious but worth making because it affects the conditions under which relief should be given: whereas advice as to value will normally save the contract with the ‘poor and ignorant person’, the master of the ship drifting onto the rocks would still have been open to exploitation even if he had had the entire House of Lords on board to advise him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In so far as the reduction of costs of production and distribution thus achieved is reflected in reduced prices, society as a whole ultimately benefits from the use of standard contracts… The use of contracts has, however, another aspect which has become increasingly important. Standard contracts are typically used by enterprises with strong bargaining power. The weaker party, in need of the goods or services, is frequently not in a position to shop around for better terms, either because the author of the standard contract has a monopoly (natural or artificial) or because all competitors use the same clauses. His contractual intention is but a subjection more or less voluntary to terms dictated by the stronger party, terms whose consequences are often understood only in a vague way, if at all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In that regard, the matters to be taken into account by the competent national court include the economic and legal context in which the parties find themselves and, as the United Kingdom Government rightly points out, the respective [[bargaining power]] and conduct of the two parties to the contract. In particular, it is for the national court to ascertain whether the party who claims to have suffered loss through concluding a contract that is liable to restrict or distort competition found himself in a markedly weaker position than the other party, such as seriously to compromise or even eliminate his freedom to negotiate the terms of the contract and his capacity to avoid the loss or reduce its extent, in particular by availing himself in good time of all the legal remedies available to him."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many states has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules, and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Adair v. United States]]'', 209 U.S. 161, 175 (1908) "the employer and the employee have equality of right and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in our free land.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is easy now to see that Parliament in 1906 might have felt that the only way of giving labour an equality of bargaining power with capital was to give it special immunities which the common law did not permit. Even now, when the scales have been redressed, it is easy to see that Parliament might think that a strike, whether reprehensible or not, ought not to be made a ground for litigation and that industrial peace should be sought by other means."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]]'' [1996] [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1996/26.html#fnB51 ZACC 26], [66], "A related argument was that the principle of equality requires that, if the right to strike is included in the NT, so should the right to lock out be included. This argument is based on the proposition that the right of employers to lock out is the necessary equivalent of the right of workers to strike and that therefore, in order to treat workers and employers equally, both should be recognised in the NT. That proposition cannot be accepted. Collective bargaining is based on the recognition of the fact that employers enjoy greater social and economic power than individual workers. Workers therefore need to act in concert to provide them collectively with sufficient power to bargain effectively with employers. Workers exercise collective power primarily through the mechanism of strike action. In theory, employers, on the other hand, may exercise power against workers through a range of weapons, such as dismissal, the employment of alternative or replacement labour, the unilateral implementation of new terms and conditions of employment, and the exclusion of workers from the workplace (the last of these being generally called a lockout). The importance of the right to strike for workers has led to it being far more frequently entrenched in constitutions as a fundamental right than is the right to lock out. The argument that it is necessary in order to maintain equality to entrench the right to lock out once the right to strike has been included, cannot be sustained, because the right to strike and the right to lock out are not always and necessarily equivalent."

===Landlord and tenant===
*''[[Rugby Joint Water Board v Footit]]'' [1973] AC 202, Lord Simon, landlord and tenant
*''[[Johnson v Moreton]]'' [1980] AC 37, [[Jocelyn Simon, Baron Simon of Glaisdale|Lord Simon]], "There was one economic and social relationship where it was claimed that there were palpably lacking the prerequisites for the beneficent operation of laisser-faire - that of landlord and tenant. The market was limited and sluggish: the supply of land could not expand immediately and flexibly in response to demand, and even humble dwellings took more time to erect than those in want of them could spare. Generally, a man became a tenant rather than an owner-occupier because his circumstances compelled him to live hand-to-mouth; the landlord's purse was generally longer and his command of knowledge and counsel far greater than the tenant's. In short, it was held, the constriction of the market and the inequality of bargaining power enabled the landlord to dictate contractual terms which did not necessarily operate to the general benefit of society. It was to counteract this descried constriction of the market and to redress this descried inequality of bargaining power that the law - specifically, in the shape of legislation - came to intervene repeatedly to modify freedom of contract between landlord and tenant. Since Maine the movement of many "progressive" societies has been reversed. The holding of a statutory or a protected tenancy is rather a status than a pure creature of contract."
*''[[Attorney General of Canada v Nav Canada]]'' (2008) FC 71, [19] Hugessen J of the Canadian Federal Court, approved the purpose of the Residential Tenancy Act in the Northwest Territories (replicated across Canadian provinces) as follows: ‘Bearing in mind the usual disparity of bargaining power and financial resources between such tenants and their landlords, the Act is evidently intended to restore the balance of power through the public employment of a rental officer to try and mediate and, if necessary, to adjudicate disputes between them.’ The Canadian Residential Tenancy Acts say residential tenancies can only be terminated with good reasons, and limit annual rental increases to a figure set by a Central Board. It should be appreciated how this differs from rent control laws, which place inflexible ceilings on any increases.

'''Inhibition theory''' is based on the basic assumption that during the performance of any mental task requiring a minimum of mental effort, the subject actually goes through a series of alternating latent states of distraction (non-work 0) and attention (work 1) which cannot be observed and are completely imperceptible to the subject. 

Additionally, the concept of inhibition or [[reactive inhibition]] which is also latent, is introduced. The assumption is made that during states of attention inhibition linearly increases with a slope ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and during states of distraction inhibition linearly decreases with a slope ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.According to this view the distraction states can be considered a sort of recovery state.

It is further assumed, that when the inhibition increases during a state of attention, depending on the amount of increase, the inclination to switch to a distraction state also increases.  When inhibition decreases during a state of distraction, depending on the amount of decrease, the inclination to switch to an attention state increases. The inclination to switch from one state to the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate, making the whole process of alternating distraction times and attention times a [[stochastic process]].

== Theory ==

A non-negative continuous random variable ''T''  represents the time until an event will take place.  The hazard rate ''λ''(''t'') for that random variable is defined to be the limiting value of the probability that the event will occur in a small interval [''t'',''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''t'']; given the event has not occurred before time ''t'', divided by Δ''t''. Formally, the hazard rate is defined by the following limit: 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Pr(t \le T &lt; t + \Delta t  \mid  T \ge t)}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

The hazard rate ''λ''(''t'') can also be written in terms of the density function or [[probability density function]] ''f''(''t'') and the distribution function or [[cumulative distribution function]] ''F''(''t''): 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} &lt;/math&gt;

The transition rates ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), from state 1 to state 0, and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), from state 0 to state 1, depend on inhibition Y(''t''): ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')   = ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y(''t'')) and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')  = ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(Y(''t'')), where ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-decreasing function and ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-increasing function. Note, that ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are dependent on ''Y'', whereas ''Y'' is dependent on ''T''. Specification of the functions ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the various inhibition models. 

What can be observed in the test are the actual reaction times. A reaction time is the sum of a series of alternating distraction times and attention times, which cannot be observed. It is, nevertheless, possible to estimate from the observable reaction times some properties of the latent process of distraction times and attention times, i.e., the average distraction time, the average attention time, and the ratio a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to be able to simulate the consecutive reaction times, inhibition theory has been specified into various inhibition models. 

One is the so-called beta inhibition model. In the beta-inhibition model, it is assumed that the inhibition Y(''t'') oscillates between two boundaries which are 0 and ''M'' (''M'' for Maximum), where ''M'' is positive. In this model ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_1 (y) = \frac{c_1 M}{M - y}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_0 (y) = \frac{c_0}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

both with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. Note that, according to the first assumption, as ''y'' goes to ''M'' (during an interval), ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of rest before the inhibition can reach ''M''. According to the second assumption, as y goes to zero (during a distraction), ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of work before the inhibition can reach zero. For a work interval starting at ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with inhibition level ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) the transition rate at time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' is given by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t). For a non-work interval starting at ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with inhibition level ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) the transition rate is given by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''t''). Therefore 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 (t) = \frac{c_1 M}{M - (y_0 + a_1 t)}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 (t) = \frac{c_0}{y_0 - a_0 t}&lt;/math&gt;

The model has ''Y'' fluctuating in the interval between 0 and ''M''. The stationary distribution of ''Y''/''M'' in this model is a beta distribution (the beta inhibition model). 

The total real working time until the conclusion of the task (or the task unit in case of a repetition of equivalent unit tasks), for example, in the Attention Concentration Test, is referred to as ''A''. The average stationary response time ''E''(''T'') may be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname E(T) = A + \frac{a_1}{a_0} A.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''M'' goes to infinity ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This model is known as the gamma − or Poisson inhibition − model (see Smit and van der Ven, 1995).

== Application ==

Inhibition theory has especially been developed to account for short-term oscillation as well as the long-term trend in the reaction time curves obtained in continuous response tasks such as the Attention Concentration Test (ACT). The ACT typically consists of an overlearned prolonged work task in which each response elicits the next. Several authors, among them Binet (1900), stressed the importance of the fluctuation in the reaction times suggesting the [[mean absolute deviation|mean deviation]] as a measure of performance. 

In this connection it is also worthwhile to mention a study by Hylan (1898). In his experiment B, he used, a 27 single digits addition task indicating the importance of the fluctuation of reaction times and was the first to report gradually increasing (marginally decreasing) reaction time curves (Hylan, 1898, page 15, figure 5).

Recently, the inhibition model has been also used to explain the phase durations in [[binocular rivalry]] experiments (van der Ven, Gremmen &amp; Smit, 2005). The model is able to account for the statistical properties of alternating phase durations

&lt;center&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., 
&lt;/center&gt;

representing the amount of time a person perceives the stimulus in one eye ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1j&lt;/sub&gt; and in the other eye ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0j&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''International Social Cognition Network''' (ISCON) was formed in 2003 as a joint enterprise between the [[European Social Cognition Network]] (ESCON) and the [[Person Memory Interest Group]] (PMIG) to act as an umbrella society to advance the international study of [[social cognition]]. Among the objectives of ISCON are to advance the understanding of social cognition by encouraging research and the preparation of papers and reports, holding meetings for the presentation of scientific papers, sponsoring or issuing publications containing scientific papers and other relevant material, establishing professional honors and awards to recognize excellence in social cognition research, and cooperating with other scientific and professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Journal==

The official journal of ISCON is ''[[Social Cognition (journal)|Social Cognition]]'', published bimonthly by [[Guilford Press]].&lt;ref&gt;(Social Cognition journal: http://guilfordjournals.com/loi/soco)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==

ISCON sponsors the Social Cognition Preconference that precedes the annual conference of the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]]. It organizes a similar preconference for the tri-annual meeting of the [[European Association of Social Psychology]]. ISCON also is a sponsor of the annual conference of the Person Memory Interest Group that precedes the annual conference of the [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Person Memory Interest Group: http://www.pmigconference.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In cooperation with the Personal Memory Interest Group, ISCON honors career contributions to the study of social cognition with the [[Thomas Ostrom|Thomas M. Ostrom]] Award. Contributions of junior scientists are honored annually with the Early Career Award. Each year, ISCON also gives an award for the Best Social Cognition Paper and recognizes outstanding research by graduate students with the Best Poster Award.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4671">'''Interstitial revolution''' is a theoretical means of societal transformation through progressively and strategically enlarging spaces of social empowerment. Interstitial revolution (or transformation) builds on the concept of [[prefigurative politics]] which has a long history in anti-capitalist thinking, going back nearly two hundred years in the anarchist tradition. [[Prefigurativism]] is neatly summed up by the early twentieth century Constitution of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] which declared: "By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preamble to the IWW Constitution {{!}} Industrial Workers of the World|url = http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml|website = www.iww.org|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, prominent analytical Marxists (including [[John Holloway (sociologist)|John Holloway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/521.abstract|title = Interstitial Revolution: On the explosive fusion of negativity and hope|date = |access-date = |website = Capital and Class|publisher = Sage Journals|last = Dinerstein|first = Ana Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erik Olin Wright]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/ERU_files/ERU-CHAPTER-10-final.pdf|title = Interstitial Transformation|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Wright|first = Eric Olin}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have called attention to the lack of strategy for greater systemic change within [[prefigurativism]] and have attempted to construct models of societal transformation utilizing interstitial devices as an alternative to the traditional Marxist theory of revolution.

== Theory ==
Central to the concept of interstitial revolution is the perspective of seeing the state as a complex multitude of institutions organized by a dominant power structure, but not so integrated that it controls all activities within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Envisioning Real Utopias|last = Wright|first = Erik Olin|publisher = Verso|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-84467-618-7|location = London, New York|pages = 323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstitial theorists suggest that within this system, radically democratic collectives (such as [[Worker-owned cooperative|Worker owned cooperatives]]) have the opportunity to gain a foothold in the "cracks" of the capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moving Against-and-Beyond or Interstitial Revolution|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265227668_Moving_Against-and-Beyond_or_Interstitial_Revolution|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[egalitarian]] institutions, working on their own or in tandem, can then use their social and economic power along with traditional forms of struggle to outmaneuver and erode limits to their growth imposed by capitalist institutions, thereby creating more space for collective economic and political power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Envisioning Real Utopias|last = Wright|first = Erik Olin|publisher = Verso|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-84467-618-7|location = London, New York|pages = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstitial theorists state that over time, enough progressive struggles and victories could potentially lead to the overcoming of the capitalist state.

[[Erik Olin Wright]] points out that there may be boundaries to the growth of an interstitial movement in which the most adept strategies of collective economic and social pressure are not enough to overcome the power of capitalist hegemony. He suggests in this case it may be necessary to resort to a more traditional form of "ruptural" revolution. However, he stresses that a substantial network of democratically run organizations is a key foundation to any revolution that wishes to yield a result of deepening democracy and creating the conditions for human flourishing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanism ==
Wright suggests that the first stage of an interstitial revolution could be starting a cooperative bank. A cooperative bank would function as a normal bank with the exception that it would give loans primarily to organized workers who wished to collectively purchase their employer's company in order to start a worker owned cooperative. Wright says this could be both an answer to a coming small business succession crisis and an opportunity for democratically run companies to gain a foothold in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = LookLeft Forum: Erik Olin Wright|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4v1i8Y4tbc|date = 2013-03-04|accessdate = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kangaroo court''' is a court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kangaroo%20court| title = kangaroo court |website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate = 2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations. The defendants in such courts are often denied access to legal representation and in some cases, proper defence.

Prejudicial bias of the decision-maker or from political decree are among the most publicized causes of kangaroo courts.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Such proceedings are often held to give the appearance of a fair and just trial, even though the verdict was already decided before the trial actually began.

A kangaroo court could also develop when the structure and operation of the forum result in an inferior brand of adjudication. A common example of this is when institutional disputants ("repeat players") have excessive and unfair structural advantages over individual disputants ("one-shot players").&lt;ref&gt;Stempel, Jeffrey W. 8 Nev. L.J. 251 (2007-2008) Keeping Arbitrations from becoming Kangaroo Courts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''kangaroo court'' is often erroneously believed to have its origin from the courts of Australia's penal colonies.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt; However, the first published instance of the term is from an American source in the year 1853.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite dictionary|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|title=kangaroo court|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggest that it may have been popularized during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, along with ''mustang court'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=kangaroo+court&amp;searchmode=none |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Etymology Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a description of the hastily carried-out proceedings used to deal with the issue of [[Land claim#Mining claim (United States)|claim jumping]] miners.&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=What's the origin of "kangaroo court"? Is "kangaroo" aborigine for "I don't know"?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/491/whats-the-origin-of-kangaroo-court|publisher=The Straight Dope|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostensibly the term comes from the notion of justice proceeding "by leaps", like a [[kangaroo]]&lt;ref name=brockbond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|archive-date=April 11, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411120510/http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes%23axzz2Nq4oSU1r#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|dead-url=yes|title=Minor League Baseball In this court most anything goes|website=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words, "jumping over" (intentionally ignoring) evidence that would be in favour of the defendant. Another possibility is that the phrase could refer to the pouch of a kangaroo, meaning the court is in someone's pocket. The phrase is popular in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand and is still in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Kangaroo+Court |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As informal proceedings in sports==
The term is sometimes used without any negative connotation. For example, many [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] teams have a kangaroo court to punish players for [[error (baseball)|errors]] and other mistakes on the field, as well as for being late for a game or practice, not wearing proper attire to road games, or having a messy locker in the clubhouse. Fines are allotted, and at the end of the year, the money collected is given to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. The organization may also use the money for a team party at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bouton | first = Jim | authorlink = Jim Bouton | title = Ball Four | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] | date = 1990 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 0-02-030665-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some examples of adjudication venues described as kangaroo courts are the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] (Volksgerichtshof) of [[Nazi Germany]] that convicted people who were suspected of being involved with the [[20 July plot#Aftermath|failed plot to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944]].

Another example is the trial of [[Pol Pot]] and his brother Ieng San by the [[People's Revolutionary Tribunal (Cambodia)|People's Revolutionary Tribunal]] in [[Cambodia]] in August 1979. After a lengthy trial with a duration of five days, both were sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'' on August 19, 1979.&lt;ref name="Schlund-Vials, C. J. 2012"&gt;Schlund-Vials, C. J. (2012), ''War, Genocide and Justice'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusive evidence showed that the verdicts and the sentencing papers had been prepared in advance of the trial.&lt;ref name=chandler&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chandler |first= David |date =  2008|title= Cambodia Deals with its Past: Collective Memory, Demonisation and Induced Amnesia |url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14690760802094933 |language = en |journal = Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |volume= 9 |issue=2-3 |pages= 355–369 |doi= 10.1080/14690760802094933|access-date= 2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on this evidence the United Nations proceeded to delegitimize the tribunal stating that it did not comply with standards of international law.&lt;ref name="Schlund-Vials, C. J. 2012"/&gt;

During the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989, [[President of Romania|President]] and [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Nicolae Ceausescu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceausescu|Elena]] were [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu|sentenced to death]] by a kangaroo court of soldiers from the [[Romanian People's Army]], which recently switched to the side of the revolutionaries.

[[File:Representation of Lake of Wada.jpg|thumb|Representation of Lake of Wada]]
In [[mathematics]], the {{nihongo|'''lakes of Wada'''|和田の湖|Wada no mizuumi}} are three [[disjoint set|disjoint]] [[connected set|connected]] [[open set]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or open unit square with the [[counterintuitive]] property that they all have the same [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. In other words, for any point selected on the boundary of ''one'' of the lakes, the other two lakes' boundaries also contain that point.

More than two sets with the same boundary are said to have the '''Wada property'''; examples include '''Wada basins''' in [[dynamical system]]s. This property is rare in real-world systems.

The lakes of Wada were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Kunizo Yoneyama|first=Kunizō|last= Yoneyama|year= 1917|loc=page 60}}, who credited the discovery to [[Takeo Wada]]. His construction is similar to the construction by {{harvtxt|Brouwer|1910}} of an [[indecomposable continuum]], and in fact it is possible for the common boundary of the three sets to be an indecomposable continuum.

==Construction of the lakes of Wada==
[[Image:Lakes of Wada.jpg|thumb|243px|right|First five stages of the Lakes of Wada]]

The Lakes of Wada are formed by starting with a closed unit square of dry land, and then digging 3 lakes according to the following rule:
*On day ''n'' = 1, 2, 3,... extend lake ''n'' mod 3 (=0, 1, 2) so that it is open and connected and passes within a distance 1/''n'' of all remaining dry land. This should be done so that the remaining dry land remains homeomorphic to a closed unit square.

After an infinite number of days, the three lakes are still disjoint connected open sets, and the remaining dry land is the boundary of each of the 3 lakes.

For example, the first five days might be (see the image on the right):
# Dig a blue lake of width 1/3 passing within {{radic|2}}/3 of all dry land.
# Dig a red lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Dig a green lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Extend the blue lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The small channel connects the thin blue lake to the thick one, near the middle of the image.)
# Extend the red lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The tiny channel connects the thin red lake to the thick one, near the top left of the image.)

A variation of this construction can produce a countable infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary: instead of extending the lakes in the order 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...., extend them in the order 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...and so on.

==Wada basins==
[[Image:Newtroot 1 0 0 m1.png|thumb|200px|right|Wada basins of attraction for {{nowrap|z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 {{=}} 0;}} all three disconnected open basins have the same boundary]]
Wada basins are certain special [[basins of attraction]] studied in the [[mathematics]] of non-linear systems. A basin having the property that every neighborhood of every point on the boundary of that basin intersects at least three basins is called a '''Wada basin''', or said to have the '''Wada property'''. Unlike the Lakes of Wada, Wada basins are often disconnected.

An example of Wada basins is given by the [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]] applied to a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, such as {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1;}} see the picture.

A physical system that demonstrates Wada basins is the pattern of reflections between three spheres in contact—see [[chaotic scattering]].

==Wada basins in chaos theory==
In [[chaos theory]], Wada basins arise very frequently. Usually, the Wada property can be seen in the  basin of attraction of dissipative dynamical systems. 
But the exit basins of Hamiltonian system can also show the Wada property. In the context of the chaotic scattering of systems with multiple exit, basin of exit shows the Wada property. 
[[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|M. A. F. Sanjuán]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wada basins and chaotic invariant sets in the  Henon-Heiles system, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066208 (2001) |url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v64/i6/e066208}}&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that in the [[Hénon-Heiles equation|Henon-Heiles system]] the exit basins have this Wada property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13323">'''Lifestyle diseases''' are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drug]] and [[smoking]] abuse as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating.  Diseases that impact on our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity and type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316|title=Lifestyle disease|website=MedicineNet|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[disease]]s that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer can include [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[chronic liver disease]] or [[cirrhosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[metabolic syndrome]], [[chronic renal failure]], [[osteoporosis]], [[stroke]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[obesity]] and [[vascular dementia]]. In the UK the death rate is four times higher from respiratory disease caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=‘Lifestyle diseases’ lead to higher mortality rates|url=http://journals.rcni.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726|journal=Mental Health Practice|volume=16|issue=6|pages=5–5|doi=10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of the disease ==
[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases. [[Drug abuse]], [[tobacco smoking]], and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] drinking, as well as a lack of or too much [[exercise]] may also increase the risk of developing certain diseases, especially later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant GE, Mukamal K.

In many [[Western world|Western]] countries, people began to consume more meat, [[dairy products]], [[vegetable oils]], tobacco, sugary foods, [[Coca-Cola]], and [[alcoholic beverages]] during the latter half of the 20th century.  People also developed [[sedentary lifestyle]]s and greater rates of [[obesity]]. In 2014 11.2 million Australians were overweight or obese &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4364.0.55.001|title=Main Features - Key findings|last=Statistics|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rates of [[colorectal cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]] and [[lung cancer]] started increasing after this dietary change.

Adults can develop lifestyle diseases through behavioural factors that impact on them.

== Death statistics in Australia ==
In 2013 there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases including smoking of tobacco, alcohol use and other drugs, violence and unhealthy weight have impacted on Australians' death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572.   All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, alcohol abuse or unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/male-health/health-status/|title=Health status (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]] was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer disease came second,  affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/deaths/leading-causes-of-death/|title=Leading causes of death (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death statistics in the United States==

In 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were [[pneumonia]]/[[influenza]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[diarrhea]]/enteritis. [[Communicable disease]]s accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, [[heart disease]] and [[cancer]] were ranked number four and eight respectively.  Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other [[degenerative diseases]]. And, by the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/lead1900_98.pdf National Center for Health Statistics, National Office of Vital Statistics, 1947] for the year 1900 (page 67), for the year 1938 (page 55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual's life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; 
was too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, [[survival rate|survivorship]] to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
[[Disease prevention|Prevention]] is remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/australias-health/2014/preventing-ill-health/#t1|title=Preventing and treating ill health (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government has started this by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-prod-reg|title=Tobacco product regulation and disclosure|last=Ageing|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|website=health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overweightness and obesity can be prevented through a well balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise.  Prevention can come about by a person undertaking 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or by doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aihw.gov.au/male-health/lifestyle-factors/|title=Lifestyle factors (AIHW)|website=aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of moderate exercise includes a brisk walk, swim, [[Cycling|bike ride]] or it can also be everyday life activities  like mowing the lawn or [[house cleaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/physical_activity_intensity/en/|title=WHO {{!}} What is Moderate-intensity and Vigorous-intensity Physical Activity?|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, animals studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falcão-Tebas|first=Filippe|last2=Kuang|first2=Jujiao|last3=Arceri|first3=Chelsea|last4=Kerris|first4=Jarrod P.|last5=Andrikopoulos|first5=Sofianos|last6=Marin|first6=Evelyn C.|last7=McConell|first7=Glenn K.|date=2018-11-08|title=Four weeks of exercise early in life reprograms adult skeletal muscle insulin resistance caused by paternal high fat diet|url=https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276386|journal=The Journal of Physiology|language=en|doi=10.1113/jp276386|issn=0022-3751}}&lt;/ref&gt; All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other drugs, reducing ones intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise.

'''MOSAIC threat assessment systems (MOSAIC)''' is a method developed by [[Gavin de Becker and Associates]] in the early 1980s to assess and screen [[threats]] and inappropriate communications.

Walt Risler of [[Indiana University]] assisted in the early development of the method, and Robert Martin, founding commander of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Threat Management Unit played a role in later development and enhancements. (Martin now heads up the MOSAIC threat assessment Unit at Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates.)

The first MOSAIC systems were developed before 1992. The computer-assisted MOSAIC method is now used by the [[Supreme Court Police]] to assess threats to the Justices, by the [[U.S. Capitol Police]] for threats against Members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], by police agencies protecting the governors of eleven states, by many large corporations, and by more than twenty top universities.

There are different MOSAIC systems for different situations, including:

* Threats and fear in the workplace
* Threats by students
* Threats against judges and other judicial officials
* Threats against public figures and public officials
* Domestic abuse situations

The MOSAIC method poses a series of questions to users, accompanied by a range of possible answers.  For every area of inquiry, the system provides a button for “Premise of the Question” – providing immediate on-screen research citations about why that particular area of inquiry is part of the assessment process.  MOSAIC calculates the value of the answers selected by the assessor, and expresses the results on a scale of 1 to 10.  Unlike most assessment tools, many of which are paper checklists, MOSAIC automatically produces a full written report, describing the factors that were considered and the selections made by the user.

MOSAIC’s on-line resources include a library of research, publications, and training videos that users can access during an assessment.

==Types of MOSAIC==

===MOSAIC – public figures (MAPP)===
MOSAIC for assessing unwanted pursuit of public figures (MAPP) is used by agencies protecting elected and appointed officials, national security agencies, and iconic public figures.

Lieutenant Tom Taylor, four-time president of the National Governor’s Security Association, wrote for the Institute of Police Technology and Management:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and documents the findings is what sets it apart. In fact, since it places less emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.&lt;ref name="dodgingbullets"&gt;Taylor, Tom.  (2000).  Dodging Bullets: A Strategic Guide to World-Class Protection.  [http://www.iptm.org/ Institute of Police Technology and Management].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MOSAIC – judicial officials (MAJ)===
In the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the [[United States Marshals Service]] undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges. He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors. Calhoun felt that these threats – often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court – were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact.

The marshal's service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun’s research, and Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ).

The book ''Hunters and Howlers: Threats &amp; Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials'' describes the method that evolved into this MOSAIC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By drawing as complete a mosaic of the threatened and each of his inappropriate communications as possible, de Becker’s system identifies those situations requiring a defensive reaction or a proactive response.  The problem is thus managed to the best and least intrusive protection of the victim. The whole approach is informed by an intelligent, comprehensive process of thinking. De Becker’s assessments are the best because he asks the most comprehensive questions, and he consistently asks them of every communication. To do fewer risks more.&lt;ref name="hunters"&gt;Calhoun, Frederick S. (February 1998).  Hunters and Howlers: Threats and Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials in the United States.  ''[[United States Marshals Service]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A variation of MAJ is now used by Sheriff’s Deputies, bailiffs, and others tasked to protect judges and other judicial officials.

===MOSAIC – domestic violence (DV-MOSAIC)===
DV - MOSAIC assesses situations involving domestic violence.  As of April 2010, DV - MOSAIC is available at no-cost to the public at [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].

A study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and published by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service found that when compared to two specific instruments, the Domestic Violence Screening Instrument (DSVI) and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID), DV - MOSAIC “performed best in predicting subsequent stalking or threats.”  The study also reported that MOSAIC tested highest on “sensitivity,” correctly classifying most of the women that were re-assaulted; had the strongest correlation between the victims’ perception of risk of re-assault and risk of serious harm; captured relevant information equally well with victims of various ethnicities; had scores that were significantly associated with abuse; and provided uniformity of assessment (called Inter-rater Reliability) such that ten different people of different abilities and styles would come up with the same preliminary rating.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Roehl, Janice Ph.D.; O’Sullivan, Chris Ph.D.; Webster, Daniel ScD; and Campbell Jacquelyn, Ph.D.  (May 2005).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment Validation Study].  ''[[U.S. Department of Justice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A synopsis of the findings is available at https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf.

The study has also been published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison,&lt;ref name="Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin - Madison Libraries [http://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/ocn789282109]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal of Interpersonal Violence,&lt;ref name="Violence"&gt;The Journal of Interpersonal Violence [http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/28/7/1537.abstract]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations Entity for Gender Equity,&lt;ref name="Gender Equity"&gt;United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women [http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1088-risk-assessment.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Violence Against Women Network.&lt;ref name= "Violence Women"&gt;The Violence Against Women Network. [http://www.vawnet.org/special-collections/DVHomicide.php]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

DV-MOSAIC is used by many police departments around the nation.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Johnson, Tracy.  (October 21, 1996).  Software Assess the Likelihood of Violence in Home. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“MOSAIC is proving successful. In the suburbs of Los Angeles where it is used, officials attribute much of the 70% decline in domestic violence to the system.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;ABC NEWS/Discovery [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Ressler]], a criminologist who worked in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit for 16 years, has referred federal agencies to de Becker. “It has a futuristic ability to predict crime and has a proven track record," Ressler said. "You can predict a crime and deal with a potential situation based on a reading from a database. It will help law enforcement deal with situations successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-21/local/me-56247_1_domestic-violence |title=Software Assesses Likelihood of Violence in Home |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Tracy |last=Johnson |date=October 21, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

===MOSAIC – workplace violence (MAT-W)===
MOSAIC – workplace violence assesses the three most likely sources of violence in the workplace: angry employees, angry former employees, and stalkers who pursue their targets at the workplace.

The development of this MOSAIC was guided by an Advisory Board of experts and practitioners from industry, government, and law enforcement.

This version of MOSAIC is used by professionals in security departments, legal departments, and human resources offices of large organizations, government agencies, and universities.

===MOSAIC for assessment of threats by students (MAST)===
The development of MOSAIC for threats by students (MAST) included an exploration into the pre-incident indicators of explosive school violence.  The process drew on more than two hundred experts and practitioners from the fields of education, counseling, psychology, parenting, [[threat assessment]], law enforcement, the judiciary, and students.

The MAST is used by school administrators, counselors, and security/law enforcement officers.

In 1997, Chief James Perrotti of the [[Yale University]] police stated that the department used MOSAIC for assessing threats made to Yale professors. He stated that MOSAIC allowed police to prioritize cases and better allocate their resources.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;Sachsman, Susanne (September 8, 1997). Prof Stalkers Beware: MOSAIC is here.  ''[Yale News]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Missouri Campus Task Force report to the Governor of Missouri on campus security and violence prevention included the recommendation that “Each institution should thoroughly evaluate the viability and appropriateness of using assessment tools (e.g. MOSAIC) designed to identify individuals with the potential for violent behavior.&lt;ref name="missouri"&gt;Missouri Campus Task Force.  (August 21, 2007).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/missouri_report.pdf Security Our Future: Making Colleges and Universities Safe Places to Learn and Grow].  Missouri Department of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education said about MOSAIC: “This is not something where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ This is bringing us to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Dr. Don"&gt;Dr. Don Ingwerson, Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==The Oprah Winfrey Show==
In April 2010, [[Oprah Winfrey]] dedicated an hour-long show to applying the MOSAIC method to domestic violence situations. It was announced on the show that Gavin de Becker was making MOSAIC available to anyone at no cost.  Tens of thousands of audience members accessed MOSAIC within the first two weeks, and this MOSAIC remains available to anyone today at no cost at [http://www.oprah.com www.oprah.com] or [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] (April 16, 2010). [[Gavin de Becker]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy about MOSAIC==
In an article on the method, psychologist Hill Walker, a professor at the University of Oregon who had studied behavioral disorders in schoolchildren for 34 years told Wired Magazine, "There are some serious validity issues here, some reputation-ruining implications.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Forrest, Brett (June 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.06/mustread.html?pg=5 UltraViolencePredictor 1.0.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;" The developers note that Hill Walker has never seen or used a MOSAIC system, and was commenting on the idea or concept, not the actual method. In a letter to the editor following publication of the article, de Becker wrote that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) “is the opposite of profiling in that it is always applied to an actual known individual, and it always explores actual behavior and circumstance.&lt;ref name="debecker"&gt;de Becker, Gavin (September 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/rants.html Rants &amp; Raves.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial, Professor [[Laurence Steinberg]] (who had never seen MOSAIC) questioned the value of the method for predicting violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the dozen or so students a year who might commit murder is like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Kansas 
.&lt;ref name="NYTSteinberg"&gt;Steinberg, Laurence.  (April 22, 2000).  Software Can't Make School Safe. ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Becker responded that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) is never applied to the general population of students, and rather just to those students who self-identify by making a threat.&lt;ref name="de Becker"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/05/opinion/l-threats-in-school-103098.html |title=Threats in School |publisher=New York Times |first=Gavin |last=de Becker |date=May 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NY Times published a letter by de Becker, commenting on Professor Steinberg's editorial.&lt;ref name="de Becker"/&gt;

==Additional Information and Comments Regarding MOSAIC==
* In 2007, the London Times reported that the city of Croyden had adopted the DV-MOSAIC model in conjunction with the co-located services approach developed by the Family Justice Center in San Diego.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;The London Times (2007) [http://themaddiecasefiles.com/topic2188.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, an article in Sheriff Magazine by Dr. Frederick Calhoun stated: “Although originally designed for assessing threats to Federal judicial officials, MOSAIC's assessments are relevant to all aspects of the judicial setting.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"&gt;Sheriff Magazine (2001) [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=189301]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 2000, officials from the CIA, Yale University Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the U.S. Marshals Service, the California Highway Patrol, and other experts participated in a comprehensive review of the MOSAIC used for assessment of threats to public figures, and an updated system emerged, now known as the MOSAIC for Assessment of Public-figure Pursuit (MAPP).
* In 2000, the State of California convened a group of experts to study the domestic violence MOSAIC, and suggested changes and enhancements. This led to the development of a special MOSAIC called CAL-MOSAIC which the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) provided at no cost to each of the State’s 600+ police departments.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;''Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training''[http://post.ca.gov/]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1999, the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts participated in a project to develop a MOSAIC specially designed for assessing threats made by students.  Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools, said at a press conference, "Our schools need to avoid overreacting to threats that aren't substantial, and this system can help them in this respect. We can't be afraid of new technology, we can't be afraid of new approaches. Violence is a fact of life across this country, and we need to equip our principals with the analytical tools to make accurate calls as to which services and intervention support to make available to their students.&lt;ref name="Vallas"&gt;Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 1998, MOSAIC was selected by the National Victim Center as one of the “Top Ten Most Promising Strategies and Practices in Using Technology to Benefit Victims.”
* U.S. Attorney General Meese and FBI Director Webster presented a special award to Gavin de Becker for “Outstanding work in developing a [[threat assessment]] model that has been of great assistance to law enforcement and criminal justice agencies.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;U.S Attorney General Meese &amp; FBI Director Webster  [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* Los Angeles County Law enforcement agencies adopted MOSAIC in 1997 to help police manage and reduce spousal abuse cases that might escalate to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-05/local/me-25642_1_domestic-violence |title= Software Aids Battle Against Home Violence |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Julie |last=Tamaki |date=February 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malaysia's Post General Election rally 2013''' or '''Himpunan Black Out 2013''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) was a series of rallies held throughout Malaysia after the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] to express discontent with the election result. The first rally was in [[Kelana Jaya]], [[Malaysia]] on 8 May 2013. The rally was held by various Malaysian opposition-friendly non-governmental organisations and opposition parties claiming that there had been irregularities in the polling. The main venue chosen for the rally was Kelana Jaya Stadium. Web sites and blogs favourable to the opposition claimed that the rally was attended by 120,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Live Report. [http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229564 "120,000 show of force at post-GE13 rally"], ''[[Malaysiakini]]'', Kelana Jaya, 8 May 2013.

==Accusing the Election Commission of fraudulent conduct==
The rally was initiated by [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who claimed that the election was fraudulent. The opposition won 3 states ([[Selangor]], [[Kelantan]] and [[Penang]]), but [[Barisan Nasional]] won the elections despite losing the popular vote, thereby gaining the mandate to lead [[Malaysia]] for another 5 years. In the rally [[Anwar Ibrahim]] urged opposition supporters to wear black as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;Razak Ahmad and Florence A. Samy. [http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20130506-420474.html "Malaysia Elections: BN wins with 133, wrests back Kedah"], ''[[Asiaone]]'', Petaling Jaya, 6 May 2013. Retrieved 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues raised==
[[Anwar Ibrahim]] and other [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) leaders present at the rally raised issues such as phantom voters, blackouts and the usage of indelible ink by the Malaysian Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-denies-bn-link-to-phantom-voter-claims |title=Najib denies BN link to phantom voter claims |last1=Chooi |first1=Clara |date=5 May 2013 |website=The Malaysian Insider |access-date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification |date=October 2015 |reason=source predates the rally, therefore does not describe discussion of these issues at the rally}}

=== Yield burning scandal ===
{{See also|Yield burning}}

In 1994, Lissack exposed a major yield burning scandal on [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="accuser"/&gt;  The issue was eventually settled by a number of firms for over $200 million,&lt;ref name=update&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DC123CF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 UPDATE/MICHAEL R. LISSACK; Wall Street Expatriate], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 14th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; to which Lissack was entitled to at least 15% per federal whistleblower laws. Lissack used some of these funds for charitable purposes including endowing a professorship in social responsibility and personal ethics at his alma mater, [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iberkshires.com/story/35532/Four-Professors-at-Williams-College-Receive-Named-Chairs.html | title=Four Professors at Williams College Receive Named Chairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16776">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[homotopy theory]], a  '''model category''' is a [[category theory|category]] with distinguished classes of [[morphism]]s ('arrows') called '[[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s', '[[fibration]]s' and '[[cofibration]]s'. These abstract from a conventional [[homotopy category]] of [[topological space]]s or of [[chain complex]]es ([[derived category]] theory), via the [[acyclic model]] theorem. The concept was introduced  by  {{harvs|txt|first=Daniel G. |last=Quillen|authorlink=Daniel  Quillen|year=1967}}.

In recent decades, the language of model categories has been used in some parts of [[algebraic K-theory|algebraic ''K''-theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]], where homotopy-theoretic approaches led to deep results.

==Motivation==

Model categories can provide a natural setting for [[homotopy theory]]: the category of topological spaces is a model category, with the homotopy corresponding to the usual theory. Similarly, objects that are thought of as spaces often admit a model category structure, such as the category of [[simplicial set]]s.

Another model category is the category of [[chain complex]]es of ''R''-modules for a commutative ring ''R''. Homotopy theory in this context is [[homological algebra]]. Homology can then be viewed as a type of homotopy, allowing generalizations of homology to other objects, such as groups and ''R''-algebras, one of the first major applications of the theory. Because of the above example regarding homology, the study of closed model categories is sometimes thought of as [[homotopical algebra]].

==Formal definition==

The definition given initially by Quillen was that of a closed model category, the assumptions of which seemed strong at the time, motivating others to weaken some of the assumptions to define a model category. In practice the distinction has not proven significant and most recent authors (e.g., Mark Hovey and Philip Hirschhorn) work with closed model categories and simply drop the adjective 'closed'.

The definition has been separated to that of a model structure on a category and then further categorical conditions on that category, the necessity of which may seem unmotivated at first but becomes important later. The following definition follows that given by Hovey.

A '''model structure''' on a category ''C'' consists of three distinguished classes of morphisms (equivalently subcategories): [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s, [[fibration]]s, and [[cofibration]]s, and two functorial factorizations &lt;math&gt;(\alpha , \beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (\gamma, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;  subject to the following axioms. Note that a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an '''acyclic''' (or '''trivial''') '''fibration'''&lt;ref&gt;Some readers find the term "trivial" ambiguous and so prefer to use "acyclic".&lt;/ref&gt; and a cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called an '''acyclic''' (or '''trivial''') '''cofibration''' (or sometimes called an '''anodyne morphism''').

;Axioms:

# ''Retracts'': if ''g'' is a morphism belonging to one of the distinguished classes, and ''f'' is a [[retract (category theory)|retract]] of ''g'' (as objects in the arrow category &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt;, where 2 is the 2-element ordered set), then ''f'' belongs to the same distinguished class. Explicitly, the requirement that ''f'' is a retract of ''g'' means that there exist ''i'', ''j'', ''r'', and ''s'', such that the following diagram commutes:
#:[[Image:Model category retract.png]]
# ''2 of 3'': if ''f'' and ''g'' are maps in ''C'' such that ''gf'' is defined and any two of these are weak equivalences then so is the third.
# ''Lifting'': acyclic cofibrations have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations, and cofibrations have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations. Explicitly, if the outer square of the following diagram commutes, where ''i'' is a cofibration and ''p'' is a fibration, and ''i'' or ''p'' is acyclic, then there exists ''h'' completing the diagram.
#:[[Image:Model category lifting.png]]
# ''Factorization'':
#* every morphism ''f'' in ''C'' can be written as &lt;math&gt;p\circ i&lt;/math&gt; for a fibration ''p'' and an acyclic cofibration ''i'';
#* every morphism ''f'' in ''C'' can be written as &lt;math&gt;p\circ i&lt;/math&gt; for an acyclic fibration ''p'' and a cofibration ''i''.

A '''model category''' is a category that has a model structure and all (small) [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[Limit (category theory)#Colimits|colimits]], i.e., a [[complete category|complete and cocomplete category]] with a model structure.

The axioms imply that any two of the three classes of maps determine the third (e.g., cofibrations and weak equivalences determine fibrations).

Also, the definition is self-dual: if ''C'' is a model category, then its [[opposite category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{op}&lt;/math&gt; also admits a model structure so that weak equivalences correspond to their opposites, fibrations opposites of cofibrations and cofibrations opposites of fibrations.

==Examples==

===Topological spaces===
The [[category of topological spaces]], '''Top''', admits a standard model category structure with the usual [[fibration|(Serre) fibrations]] and with weak equivalences as weak homotopy equivalences.  The cofibrations are not the usual notion found [[cofibration|here]], but rather the narrower class of maps that have the left lifting property with respect to the acyclic Serre fibrations.
Equivalently, they are the retracts of the relative cell complexes, as explained for example in Hovey's ''Model Categories''. This structure is not unique; in general there can be many model category structures on a given category. For the category of topological spaces, another such structure is given by [[Hurewicz fibration]]s and standard cofibrations, and the weak equivalences are the (strong) [[Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence|homotopy equivalences]].

===Chain complexes===
The category of (nonnegatively graded) [[chain complex]]es of ''R''-modules carries at least two model structures, which both feature prominently in homological algebra:
*weak equivalences are maps that induce [[isomorphism]]s in homology;
*cofibrations are maps that are [[monomorphism]]s in each degree with projective [[cokernel]]; and
*fibrations are maps that are [[epimorphism]]s in each nonzero degree

or
*weak equivalences are maps that induce [[isomorphism]]s in homology;
*fibrations are maps that are [[epimorphism]]s in each degree with injective [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]]; and
*cofibrations are maps that are [[monomorphism]]s in each nonzero degree.

This explains why Ext-groups of ''R''-modules can be computed by either resolving the source projectively or the target injectively. These are cofibrant or fibrant replacements in the respective model structures.

The category of arbitrary chain-complexes of ''R''-modules has a model structure that is defined by

* weak equivalences are [[chain homotopy equivalence]]s of chain-complexes;
* cofibrations are monomorphisms that are split as morphisms of underlying ''R''-modules; and
* fibrations are epimorphisms that are split as morphisms of underlying ''R''-modules.

===Further examples===
Other examples of categories admitting model structures include the category of all small categories, the category of [[simplicial set]]s or [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on any small [[Grothendieck site]], the category of topological spectra, and the categories of simplicial spectra or [[sheaf of spectra|presheaves of simplicial spectra]] on a small Grothendieck site.

Simplicial objects in a category are a frequent source of model categories; for instance, [[simplicial commutative ring]]s or simplicial ''R''-modules admit natural model structures. This follows because there is an adjunction between simplicial sets and simplicial commutative rings (given by the forgetful and free functors), and in nice cases one can lift model structures under an adjunction.

A ''simplicial model category'' is a [[Simplicially enriched category|simplicial category]] with a model structure that is compatible with the simplicial structure.&lt;ref&gt;Definition 2.1. of [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101162].&lt;/ref&gt;

Given any category ''C'' and a model category ''M'', under certain extra hypothesis the category of [[functor]]s Fun (''C'', ''M'') (also called ''C''-diagrams in ''M'') is also a model category. In fact, there are always ''two'' candidates for distinct model structures: in one, the so-called projective model structure, fibrations and weak equivalences are those maps of functors which are fibrations and weak equivalences when evaluated at each object of ''C''. Dually, the injective model structure is similar with cofibrations and weak equivalences instead. In both cases the third class of morphisms is given by a lifting condition (see below). In some cases, when the category ''C'' is a [[Reedy category]], there is a third model structure lying in between the projective and injective.

The process of forcing certain maps to become weak equivalences in a new model category structure on the same underlying category is known as [[Bousfield localization]]. For example, the category of simplicial [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] can be obtained as a Bousfield localization of the model category of simplicial [[presheaf|presheaves]].

Denis-Charles Cisinski has developed&lt;ref&gt;Cisinski, Denis-Charles. Les préfaisceaux comme modèles des types d'homotopie. (French) [Presheaves as models for homotopy types] Astérisque No. 308 (2006), xxiv+390 pp. {{isbn|978-2-85629-225-9}} {{MR|2294028}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general theory of model structures on presheaf categories (generalizing simplicial sets, which are presheaves on the [[simplex category]]).

If ''C'' is a model category, then so is the category Pro(''C'') of [[pro-object]]s in ''C''. However, a model structure on Pro(''C'') can also be constructed by imposing a weaker set of axioms to ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|
mr=3459031|author1=Barnea, Ilan|author2=Schlank, Tomer M.|title=A projective model structure on pro-simplicial sheaves, and the relative étale homotopy type. |journal= Adv. Math.|volume=291|year=2016|pages=784–858|arxiv=1109.5477|bibcode=2011arXiv1109.5477B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some constructions ==

Every closed model category has a [[terminal object]] by completeness and an [[initial object]] by cocompleteness, since these objects are the limit and colimit, respectively, of the empty diagram. Given an object ''X'' in the model category, if the unique map from the initial object to ''X'' is a cofibration, then ''X'' is said to be '''cofibrant'''. Analogously, if the unique map from ''X'' to the terminal object is a fibration then ''X'' is said to be '''fibrant'''.

If ''Z'' and ''X'' are objects of a model category such that ''Z'' is cofibrant and there is a weak equivalence from ''Z'' to ''X'' then ''Z'' is said to be a '''cofibrant replacement''' for ''X''. Similarly, if ''Z'' is fibrant and there is a weak equivalence from ''X'' to ''Z'' then ''Z'' is said to be a '''fibrant replacement''' for ''X''. In general, not all objects are fibrant or cofibrant, though this is sometimes the case. For example, all objects are cofibrant in the standard model category of simplicial sets and all objects are fibrant for the standard model category structure given above for topological spaces.

Left homotopy is defined with respect to [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cylinder+object cylinder objects] and right homotopy is defined with respect to [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/path+space+object path space objects]. These notions coincide when the domain is cofibrant and the codomain is fibrant. In that case, homotopy defines an equivalence relation on the hom sets in the model category giving rise to homotopy classes.

== Characterizations of fibrations and cofibrations by lifting properties ==

Cofibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to acyclic fibrations, and acyclic cofibrations are characterized as the maps which have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations. Similarly, fibrations can be characterized as the maps which have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to acyclic cofibrations, and acyclic fibrations are characterized as the maps which have the right lifting property with respect to cofibrations.

==Homotopy and the homotopy category==

The ''homotopy category'' of a model category ''C'' is the [[Localization of a category|localization]] of ''C'' with respect to the class of weak equivalences. This definition of homotopy category does not depend on the choice of fibrations and cofibrations. However, the classes of fibrations and cofibrations are useful in describing the homotopy category in a different way and in particular avoiding set-theoretic issues arising in general localizations of categories. More precisely, the "fundamental theorem of model categories" states that the homotopy category of ''C'' is equivalent to the category whose objects are the objects of ''C'' which are both fibrant and cofibrant, and whose morphisms are left homotopy classes of maps (equivalently, right homotopy classes of maps) as defined above. (See for instance Model Categories by Hovey, Thm 1.2.10)

Applying this to the category of topological spaces with the model structure given above, the resulting homotopy category is equivalent to the category of [[CW complexes]] and homotopy classes of continuous maps, whence the name.

===Quillen adjunctions===
A pair of [[adjoint functor]]s
:&lt;math&gt;F: C \leftrightarrows D : G&lt;/math&gt;
between two model categories ''C'' and ''D'' is called a [[Quillen adjunction]] if ''F'' preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations or, equivalently by the closed model axioms, such that G preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations. In this case ''F'' and ''G'' induce an adjunction
:&lt;math&gt;LF: Ho(C) \leftrightarrows Ho(D) : RG&lt;/math&gt;
between the homotopy categories. There is also an explicit criterion for the latter to be an equivalence (''F'' and ''G'' are called a ''Quillen equivalence'' then).

A typical example is the standard adjunction between [[simplicial set]]s and topological spaces:
:&lt;math&gt;|-|: \mathbf{sSet} \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Top} : Sing&lt;/math&gt;
involving the geometric realization of a simplicial set and the singular chains in some topological space. The categories '''sSet''' and '''Top''' are not equivalent, but their homotopy categories are. Therefore, simplicial sets are often used as models for topological spaces because of this equivalence of homotopy categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19188">In the mathematical field of [[real analysis]], the '''monotone convergence theorem''' is any of a number of related theorems proving the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of [[monotonic sequence]]s (sequences that are [[increasing]] or [[decreasing]]) that are also [[Bounded function|bounded]]. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a [[supremum]], then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an [[infimum]], it will converge to the infimum.

==Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers==

===Lemma 1===
If a sequence of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its [[supremum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
Let &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be such a sequence. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and bounded above. By the [[least-upper-bound property]] of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;c = \sup_n \{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is finite. Now, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_N &gt; c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;, since otherwise &lt;math&gt;c - \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts to the definition of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is increasing, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is its upper bound, for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|c - a_n| \leq |c - a_N| &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by definition, the limit of &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sup_n \{a_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lemma 2===
If a sequence of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its [[infimum]] is the limit.

===Proof===
The proof is similar to the proof for the case when the sequence is increasing and bounded above,

===Theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;\{ a_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is a monotone [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s (i.e., if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1 or ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' ≥ 1), then this sequence has a finite limit if and only if the sequence is [[bounded sequence|bounded]].&lt;ref&gt;A generalisation of this theorem was given by {{cite journal |first=John |last=Bibby |year=1974 |title=Axiomatisations of the average and a further generalisation of monotonic sequences |journal=[[Glasgow Mathematical Journal]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=63–65 |doi=10.1017/S0017089500002135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof===
* "If"-direction: The proof follows directly from the lemmas.
* "Only If"-direction: By [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|definition of limit]], every sequence &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with a finite limit &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily bounded.

==Convergence of a monotone series==

===Theorem===
If for all natural numbers ''j'' and ''k'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-negative real number and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1,''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, then&lt;ref&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=J. |last=Yeh |title=Real Analysis: Theory of Measure and Integration |location=Hackensack, NJ |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 |isbn=981-256-653-8 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j\to\infty} \sum_k a_{j,k} = \sum_k \lim_{j\to\infty} a_{j,k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that
#the columns are weakly increasing and bounded, and
#for each row, the [[series (mathematics)|series]] whose terms are given by this row has a convergent sum,
then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term ''k'' is given by the limit of column ''k'' (which is also its [[supremum]]). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent.

As an example, consider the infinite series of rows

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1+ \frac1 n\right)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk/n^k = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac1{k!} \times \frac nn \times \frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' approaches infinity (the limit of this series is [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]). Here the matrix entry in row ''n'' and column ''k'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk/n^k=\frac1{k!}\times\frac nn\times\frac{n-1}n\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}n;&lt;/math&gt;

the columns (fixed ''k'') are indeed weakly increasing with ''n'' and bounded (by 1/''k''!), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums &lt;math&gt;(1+1/n)^n&lt;/math&gt; by taking the sum of the column limits, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac1{k!}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem for Lebesgue integral==
The following result is due to [[Beppo Levi]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]]. In what follows, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of Borel sets on &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt; contains the set &lt;math&gt;\{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; and all Borel subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R_{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]], and &lt;math&gt;X\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a pointwise non-decreasing sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}^\infty_{k=1}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-[[Measurable function|measurable]] non-negative functions &lt;math&gt;f_k:X\to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for every &lt;math&gt;{k\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq f_k(x) \leq f_{k+1}(x)\leq\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Set the pointwise limit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for every  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; f(x):= \lim_{k\to\infty} f_k(x). &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable and

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_X f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark 1.''' The integrals may be finite or infinite.

'''Remark 2.''' The theorem remains true if its assumptions hold &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a [[null set]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; non-decreases for every &lt;math&gt;{x\in X\setminus N}.&lt;/math&gt; To see why this is true, we start with an observation that allowing the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ f_n \}&lt;/math&gt; to pointwise non-decrease almost everywhere causes its pointwise limit &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be undefined on some null set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. On that null set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may then be defined arbitrarily, e.g. as zero, or in any other way that preserves measurability. To see why this will not affect the outcome of the theorem, note that since &lt;math&gt;{\mu(N)=0},&lt;/math&gt; we have, for every &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_X f \,d\mu = \int_{X \setminus N} f \,d\mu, &lt;/math&gt;

provided that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"&gt;See for instance {{cite book |first=Erik |last=Schechter |title=Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-12-622760-8 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.38}} (These equalities follow directly from the definition of Lebesgue integral for a non-negative function).

'''Remark 3.''' Under assumptions of the theorem,
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) = \liminf_k f_k(x) = \limsup_k f_k(x) = \sup_k f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \textstyle \limsup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu = \sup_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
}}

(Note that the second chain of equalities follows from Remark 5).

'''Remark 4.''' The proof below does not use any properties of Lebesgue integral except those established here. The theorem, thus, can be used to prove other basic properties, such as linearity, pertaining to Lebesgue integration.

'''Remark 5 (monotonicity of Lebesgue integral).''' In the proof below, we apply the monotonic property of Lebesgue integral to non-negative functions only. Specifically (see Remark 4), let the functions &lt;math&gt;f,g : X \to [0,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable.

*If &lt;math&gt;f \leq g&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu \leq \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

*If &lt;math&gt; X_1,X_2 \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_1 \subseteq X_2, &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X_1} f\,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.''' Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(h)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq h&lt;/math&gt; everywhere on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt; 

'''1.''' Since &lt;math&gt;f \leq g,&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SF}(f) \subseteq \operatorname{SF}(g). &lt;/math&gt;

By definition of Lebesgue integral and the properties of supremum,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu = \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu \leq \sup_{s\in {\rm SF}(g)}\int_X s\,d\mu = \int_X g\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{X_1}&lt;/math&gt; be the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; It can be deduced from the definition of Lebesgue integral that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu = \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

if we notice that, for every &lt;math&gt;s \in {\rm SF}(f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; outside of &lt;math&gt;X_1.&lt;/math&gt; Combined with the previous property, the inequality &lt;math&gt; f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \leq f&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{X_1} f \,d\mu = \int_{X_2} f\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{X_1} \,d\mu \leq \int_{X_2} f \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
This proof does ''not'' rely on [[Fatou's lemma]]. However, we do explain how that lemma might be used.

For those not interested in independent proof, the intermediate results below may be skipped.
====Intermediate results====
=====Lebesgue integral as measure=====
'''Lemma 1.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be a measurable space. Consider a simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s:\Omega\to{\mathbb R_{\geq 0}}&lt;/math&gt;. For a subset &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(S)=\int_Ss\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

======Proof======
Monotonicity follows from Remark 5. Here, we will only prove countable additivity, leaving the rest up to the reader. Let &lt;math&gt;S=\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint. Due to simplicity,
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot {\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
for some finite non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in{\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; and pairwise disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\cup^n_{i=1}A_i=\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By definition of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nu(S)&amp;=\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu(S\cap A_i)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl((\cup^\infty_{j=1}S_j)\cap A_i\bigr)\\
      &amp;=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the sets &lt;math&gt;S_j\cap A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, the countable additivity of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;
gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\mu\bigl(\cup^\infty_{j=1}(S_j\cap A_i)\bigr)=\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i).
&lt;/math&gt;
Since all the summands are non-negative, the sum of the series, whether this sum is finite or infinite, cannot change if summation order does. For that reason,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot\sum^\infty_{j=1}\mu(S_j\cap A_i)&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\sum^n_{i=1}c_i\cdot
\mu(S_j\cap A_i)\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\int_{S_j} s\,d\mu\\
&amp;=\sum^\infty_{j=1}\nu(S_j),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

====="Continuity from below"=====
The following property is a direct consequence of the definition of measure.

'''Lemma 2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a measure, and &lt;math&gt;S=
\cup^\infty_{i=1}S_i&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
S_1\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S_i\subseteq S_{i+1}\subseteq\ldots\subseteq S
&lt;/math&gt;
is a non-decreasing chain with all its sets &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-measurable. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\lim_i\mu(S_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof of theorem====
'''Step 1.''' We begin by showing that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; (\Sigma, \operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}}) &lt;/math&gt;–measurable.&lt;ref name="SCHECHTER1997"/&gt;{{rp|at=section 21.3}}

'''Note.''' If we were using Fatou's lemma, the measurability would follow easily from Remark 3(a).

To do this ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[Sigma-algebra|sigma-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, because (closed) intervals generate the [[Borel sigma algebra]] on the reals. Since &lt;math&gt;[0,t]&lt;/math&gt; is a closed interval, and, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0\le f_k(x) \le f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;0\leq f(x)\leq t\quad \Leftrightarrow\quad \Bigl[\forall k\quad 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\Bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in X \mid 0\leq f(x)\leq t\} = \bigcap_k \{x\in X \mid 0\leq f_k(x)\leq t\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Being the inverse image of a [[Borel set]] under a &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, each set in the countable intersection is an element of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras are, by definition, closed under countable intersections, this shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable, and the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_X f \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt; is well defined (and possibly infinite).

'''Step 2.''' We will first show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_X f \,d\mu \geq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu. &lt;/math&gt;

The definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\{f_k\}&lt;/math&gt; imply that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. By monotonicity (or, more precisely, its narrower version established in Remark 5; see also Remark 4) of Lebesgue integral,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\int_X f_k\,d\mu,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f\,d\mu\geq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the limit on the right exists (finite or infinite) because, due to monotonicity (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), the sequence is non-decreasing.

'''End of Step 2.'''

We now prove the reverse inequality. We seek to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof using Fatou's lemma.''' Per Remark 3, the inequality we want to prove is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \liminf_k f_k(x) \,d\mu \leq \liminf_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
But the latter follows immediately from Fatou's lemma, and the proof is complete.

'''Independent proof.''' To prove the inequality ''without'' using Fatou's lemma, we need some extra machinery. Denote &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; the set of simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable functions &lt;math&gt;s:X\to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;0\leq s\leq f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3.''' Given a simple function &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;t\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\{x\in X\mid t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)\}\subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k\subseteq B^{s,t}_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Step 3a.''' To prove the first claim, let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle s=\sum^m_{i=1}c_i\cdot{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;, for some finite collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\cup^m_{i=1}A_i&lt;/math&gt;, some (finite) non-negative constants &lt;math&gt;c_i\in {\mathbb R}_{\geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}_{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; denoting the indicator function of the set &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For every &lt;math&gt; x\in A_i, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t\cdot s(x)\leq f_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; f_k(x) \in [t\cdot c_i, +\infty].&lt;/math&gt; Given that the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint,

:&lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k=\bigcup^m_{i=1}\Bigl(f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)\cap A_i\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the pre-image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}_k\Bigl([t\cdot c_i,+\infty]\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt; of the Borel set
&lt;math&gt;[t\cdot c_i,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt; under the measurable function &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is measurable, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, by definition, are closed under finite intersection and unions, the first claim follows.

'''Step 3b.''' To prove the second claim, note that, for each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_k(x)\leq f_{k+1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3c.''' To prove the third claim, we show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, if, to the contrary, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X\not\subseteq\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, then an element
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_0\in X\setminus\bigcup_k B^{s,t}_k=\bigcap_k(X\setminus B^{s,t}_k)&lt;/math&gt;
exists such that &lt;math&gt;f_k(x_0)&lt;t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_0)\leq t\cdot s(x_0)&lt;s(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
But by initial assumption, &lt;math&gt;s\leq f&lt;/math&gt;. This is a contradiction.

'''Step 4.''' For every simple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\operatorname{\mathcal B}_{\R_{\geq 0}})&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative function &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
To prove this, define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\nu(S)=\int_S s_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 1, &lt;math&gt;\nu(S)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. By "continuity from below" (Lemma 2),
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_n\int_{B^{s,t}_n}s_2\,d\mu=\lim_n\nu(B^{s,t}_n)=\nu(X)=\int_Xs_2\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 5.''' We now prove that, for every &lt;math&gt;s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, using the definition of &lt;math&gt;B^{s,t}_k&lt;/math&gt;, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of Lebesgue integral (see Remark 5 and Remark 4), we have
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B^{s,t}_k}t\cdot s\,d\mu\leq\int_{B^{s,t}_k} f_k\,d\mu\leq\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
for every &lt;math&gt;k\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. In accordance with Step 4, as &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality becomes
:&lt;math&gt;t\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;t\uparrow 1&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
as required.

'''Step 6.''' We are now able to prove the reverse inequality, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu \leq \lim_k \int_X f_k \,d\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Indeed, by non-negativity, &lt;math&gt;f_+ = f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_- = 0.&lt;/math&gt; For the calculation below, the non-negativity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is essential. Applying the definition of Lebesgue integral and the inequality established in Step 5, we have
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \,d\mu=\sup_{s\in\operatorname{SF}(f)}\int_X s\,d\mu\leq\lim_k\int_X f_k\,d\mu.&lt;/math&gt;
The proof is complete.

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

'''Negative priming''' is an [[implicit memory]] effect in which prior exposure to a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] unfavorably influences the response to the same stimulus. It falls under the category of [[priming (psychology)|priming]], which  refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a [[subconscious]] memory effect. Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored.&lt;ref name="rev" &gt;Mayr, S. &amp; A. Buchner (2007) Negative priming as a memory phenomenon—A review of 20 years of negative priming research. Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 215, 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a pen holder. The red pen becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when there is more than one nontarget item that is selected against&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, E. &amp; DeSchepper, B.G. (1992). An inhibition-based fan effect: Evidence for an active suppression mechanism in selective attention. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 46 (1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.

Negative priming is believed to play a crucial role in [[attention]] and [[Recall (memory)|memory retrieval]] processes. When stimuli are perceived through the [[senses]], all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own [[direct and indirect realism|internal representation]]. In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in [[short-term memory]]. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.

Broadly, negative priming is also known as the mechanism by which inhibitory control is applied to [[cognition]]. This refers only to the inhibition stimuli that can interfere with the current short-term goal of creating a response.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Dempster, Frank N. (Ed); Brainerd, Charles J. (Ed), (1995). Interference and inhibition in cognition. San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of inhibiting the interferences depends on the [[cognitive control]] mechanism as a higher number of distractors yields higher load on [[working memory]]. Increased load on working memory can in turn result in slower perceptual processing leading to delayed reaction. Therefore, negative priming effect depends on the amount of distractors, effectiveness of the cognitive control mechanism and the availability of the cognitive control resources.&lt;ref&gt;de Fockert, J. W., Mizon, G. A., &amp; D'Ubaldo, M. (2010). No Negative Priming Without Cognitive Control. Journal of Experimental Psychology–Human Perception and Performance, 36(6), 1333–1341.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and classic models==
There are a number of theories and models that try to explain the reason behind negative priming. They all try to reason negative priming's role in [[cognition]] and justify why it occurs. A few of the well-known models are presented below.

===Distractor inhibition model===
[[File:Distractor inhibition model.jpg|thumb|'''Distractor inhibition model''' with selective attention and encoding process.]]
'''Distractor inhibition model''' is the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect as the result of selective attention to a target [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate [[memory inhibition|residual inhibition]].&lt;ref name="does"&gt;Tipper, S.P. (2001). Does negative priming reflect inhibitory mechanisms? A review and integration of conflicting views. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Experimental Psychology, 54A, 321–343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tipper, S.P. (1985). The negative priming effect: Inhibitory priming by ignored objects. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Experimental Psychology, 37A, 571–590.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attention#Selective Attention|Selective attention]] is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitation]] to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the [[direct and indirect realism|internal representations]] of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This is referred to as the transient [[memory inhibition|residual inhibition]]. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater [[reaction time]].&lt;ref name= "does"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "HTM"&gt;Houghton, G., &amp; Tipper, S. P. (1994). A model of inhibitory mechanisms in selective attention. In D. Dagenbach &amp; T. H. Carr (Eds.), Inhibitory processes in attention memory and language (pp. 53–112). San Diego, CA, US: Academic Press, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few problems associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative priming effects have been found to be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition.&lt;ref name= "long"&gt;Grison, S., Tipper, S. P., &amp; Hewitt, O. (2005). Long-term negative priming: Support for retrieval of prior attentional processes. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section a-Human Experimental Psychology, 58(7), 1199–1224.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.

===Episodic retrieval model===
[[File:Episode retrieval model.jpg|thumb|'''Episode retrieval model''' with the retrieval of "do-not-respond" tag.]]
The '''episodic retrieval model''' is the current popular model and explains that negative priming occurs due to memory [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. This model theorizes that each encounter with a stimulus is encoded and stored separately as an individual episode. Each episode includes perceptual details of both the stimuli and the response developed for that stimulus. When a stimulus is encountered the second time, the previous episode regarding that stimulus along with its tags of perceptual details, role in selective attention, and response given are all retrieved automatically. When the repetitively ignored distractor stimulus is encountered as the target, a tag associated with the response to the stimulus is also retrieved. This response tag of a distractor will likely be "do-not-respond" tag as opposed to the "respond" tag of the target stimulus. [[Recall (memory)|Retrieval]] of the previous "do-not respond" tag of the stimulus conflicts with the current "respond" tag. This presents a problem of whether to respond or not. Resolving this conflict takes time and produces negative priming effect.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N1992"&gt;Neill, W.T., Valdes, L.A., Terry, K.M., &amp; Gorfein, D.S. (1992). Persistence of negative priming: II. Evidence for episodic trace retrieval. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 993–1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode retrieval model has gained more popularity over the last decade compared to the distractor inhibition model due to the issues with long-term negative priming. Episode retrieval varies from the distractor inhibition model because it claims that the negative priming occurs only when the memory of the stimuli is retrieved and not during the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] of the distractor stimuli. Recent findings lean towards this model but the model itself is not entirely complete. Its idea of association tags like the "do-not-respond" tag is vague and needs concrete evidence to support this model.

===Houghton–Tipper model===
[[File:Houghton-Tipper.jpg|thumb|'''Houghton–Tipper model''' with inhibition occurring during encoding and retrieval.]]
Due to the issues found with the distractor inhibition model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The '''Houghton–Tipper model''' revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] of distractors and the retrieval of that memory. The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves the memory of the stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="does"/&gt; Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.

===Feature mismatch hypothesis===
This theory proposes that negative priming effect is the result of [[interference theory|interference]] due to the target being located where the distractor was once located.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; When the target stimulus and distractor stimulus are repeatedly placed in the same location, we know their respective location and pay attention more to the location of the target than the target itself. Our response to the target is also faster because we have already identified where to pay attention. This is called [[Simon effect]], which refers our innate tendency to respond faster and more accurately when stimuli occur in the same location. This can be explained by neuroscience in terms of [[neural facilitation]] and short-term [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]. However, if the positions of the stimuli are not the same as before, it is no longer easy to attend to the target as it once was. The feature mismatch hypothesis states that inhibition occurs when there is a mismatch between the target and its location. 
This theory is explains the effects of location specific negative priming but lacks in its justification of negative priming when location is not involved.&lt;ref name="feature"&gt;Park, J., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1994). Negative priming for spatial locations: Identity mismatching, not distractor inhibition. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 20, 613–623.&lt;/ref&gt; It deviates from the distractor inhibition model to describe location specific negative priming but has more loop holes than the other models.

===Temporal discrimination model===
'''Temporal discrimination model''' attempts to blend in both the selective attention and memory retrieval aspects of negative priming in a less complex model. It is based on the assumption that negative priming is caused only at the moment of response to a stimulus that was previously considered distractor.&lt;ref name="temp"&gt;Milliken, B., Joordens, S., Merikle, P.M., &amp; Seiffert, A.E. (1998). Selective attention: A reevaluation of the implications of negative priming. Psychological Review, 105, 203–229.&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains negative priming as the delayed response due to confusion in classifying a stimulus as old or new. A new stimulus is immediately classified as new and undergoes [[information processing theory|perceptual processing]]. A repeated old stimulus is familiar and cues the automatic retrieval of the prior episode. A stimulus that has been repetitively ignored prior to becoming the target is neither entirely new nor old. This ambiguity slows down the processing of the stimuli. The temporal discrimination model points to this ambiguity as the cause of slowed categorization of the stimulus leading to negative priming effect. Like feature mismatch hypothesis, this model also claims that negative priming is not due to selective attention of the target or the inhibition of the distractor. This model argues that "negative priming is an emergent consequence of a discrimination process that is inherent to memory retrieval". Temporal discrimination model explains negative priming without reference to inhibition of distractors or the "do not respond" tag and by simple discrimination of "old", "new" and "in between" categories.&lt;ref name="temp"/&gt;

==Characteristics of negative priming in experiments==

===Experimental terminology===
Experiments on negative priming consist of two main components: prime and probe. '''Prime''' trial tries to mimic real life experiences of distractor stimuli in target selection but with more repetition to get quantifiable negative priming data. It comprises the initial presentation and the repetitive trials of the target and the distractor stimuli. It is set up such that a set of distractor stimuli are constantly ignored in the process of target selection. In the previous example provided, prime refers to the repeated perception of the blue pen as the distractor. '''Probe''' trial in an experiment refers to the actual testing for negative priming effects. In this trial, the repeated distractor of the prime trial is presented as the target. The [[reaction time]] of the response for the probe target (prime distractor) is measured to quantify the negative priming effect.

Some experiments may use additional '''[[interference theory|interferences]]''' such as changing the position of the stimuli or presenting completely irrelevant stimuli during either of these trials.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The magnitude of negative priming effects are found to be higher with these interferences. Interferences are used to investigate how the response to the distractor changes under conditions of a third interfering stimulus.

===Stimulus modality===

[[File:Stroop task1.jpg|thumb|Example of Stroop color–word task with control, prime and probe trials.]]
The primary two stimulus modalities used for negative priming research are visual and auditory stimulus materials. The stimulus presented varied from objects or symbols in visual field to human voices or artificial sounds. Stronger negative priming effects are found for auditory stimulus but the standardized effect sizes between the modalities did not vary.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; Evidence for negative priming has also been found across various modes of response including vocal naming, manual key press, and reaching.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Negative priming was observed for various types of judgment such as identification, categorization, matching, counting and localization. The tasks used to find evidence for negative priming includes Stroop color–word task, lexical decision task, identification, matching, and localization tasks. The Stroop color–word task utilizes the [[Stroop effect]] to observe the distractor suppression and negative priming. Identification tasks present a set of  images, sounds, words, symbols, or letters and require the subject to select the prime target based a particular feature that differentiates the target from the distractor. [[polysemy|Lexical]] decision utilizes [[semantic]] knowledge of the subject and tests the subject ability to remember the multiple meanings and uses of one word. For example, the word "bank" has multiple meanings and can be referred in different contexts such as "bank is a place where money is deposited" or "banks of a river".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Matching tasks require subjects to respond "same" or "different" by matching the target letters or shapes with the explicitly specified goal while ignoring the distractor. Localization tasks require some form of movement of subjects to respond to the location of the target stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Tipper, S. P., Meegan, D., &amp; Howard, L. A. (2002). Action-centered negative priming: Evidence for reactive inhibition. Visual Cognition, 9(4–5), 591–614.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of localization task is especially used to test the feature mismatch hypothesis as it provides evidence for negative priming during the mismatch of the location and target stimuli.

===RSI effects===
'''Response–stimulus interval (RSI)''' is another form of data that is used to quantify negative priming. RSI is the time difference between the response to prime target and the onset of probe trial. Negative priming effects are observed for delays of 20 millisecond to 8000 millisecond between the prime trial and the probe trial. Several experiments found that negative priming decays rapidly during this delay between prime and probe trials.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Many studies have tried to find a rate of this [[decay theory|decay]] but have not been successful.&lt;ref name="N1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inhib"&gt;Tipper, S. P., Weaver, B., Cameron, S., Brehaut, J. C., &amp; Bastedo, J. (1991). Inhibitory mechanisms of attention in identification and localization tasks: Time course and disruption. Journal of Experimental Psychology. Learning Memory And Cognition, 17(4), 681–692.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of both the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model use varying results of the RSI effects to justify the decay as a part of their model. More globally accepted research is needed to determine concrete RSI data and establish short-term and long-term negative priming limits.

==Neuroanatomy and imaging==
Neurological evidence of negative priming effects is being researched to help understand the [[physiological]] aspects and to develop more accurate models. The most common method to find such neurological evidence is by [[neuroimaging]] the brain using [[fMRI]] while subjects go through experiments of tasks that prompt negative priming effects. The two primary bases for neurological evidence are the internal representations of stimuli and memory retrieval. Most significantly activated regions of the brain are the left temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and the prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name= "ni"&gt;Steel, C., Haworth, E. J., Peters, E., Hemsley, D. R., Sharma, T., Gray, J. A., Pickering, A., et al. (2001). Neuroimaging correlates of negative priming. NeuroReport, 12(16), 3619–3624.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for internal representations are found in the left [[anterior]] [[temporal cortex]], which has been associated with abstract [[semantic memory|semantic]] [[knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representations]].&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L., Rogers, T.T., 2003. The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic cognition. Nature Reviews, Neuroscience, 4, 310–322.&lt;/ref&gt; Left anterolateral temporal cortex was found to be directly related to the magnitude of negative priming effect.&lt;ref&gt;de Zubicaray, G., McMahon, K., Eastburn, M., Pringle, A., Lorenz, L. (2006). Classic identity negative priming involves accessing semantic representations in the left anterior temporal cortex, NeuroImage, 33(1), 383–390.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|inferior]] [[parietal lobe]] is connected to the shifts in attention that occurs when attending to the distractors and the target. The inferior parietal cortex activated whenever attention shifted from the distractor to target stimulus or vice versa.&lt;ref name= "ni"/&gt; Another significant area of activation was found in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The superior, inferior, and medial frontal [[gyri]], and the medial prefrontal cortex exhibited activation during the negative priming tasks.&lt;ref name= "ocd"&gt;. Wright, C.I., Keuthen, N.J., Savage, C.R., Martis, B., Williams, D., Wedig, M., McMullin, K., Rauch, S.L. (2006). Brain correlates of negative and positive visuospatial priming in adults, NeuroImage, 30(3):983–991.&lt;/ref&gt; Activations in the frontal lobe has been associated with inhibitory network and selective attention. Similarly, evidences for semantic representations and temporal lobe activations are used to support the episode retrieval model. Additional investigations of the neurophysiological data of negative priming are necessary to further clarify the relationship between selective attention and memory in negative priming.

==Pathology==
Negative priming is identified as one of the cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory. [[neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric disorders]] may be due to problems with some of the above-mentioned areas of cognition. Currently, [[schizophrenia]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], and [[Tourette syndrome]] are being studied with reference to negative priming.&lt;ref name= "ocd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egner, T., &amp; Hirsch, J. (2005). Where memory meets attention: neural substrates of negative priming. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17(11), 1774–1784.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the paradigm of negative priming can lead to the use of negative priming tasks as diagnosing tools to identify the disorders. Knowledge about the physiological basis of negative priming can also help in designing therapies or treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.

==Conclusion==
Among the four theories, the feature mismatch hypothesis and the temporal discrimination model lack solid evidence and are inadequate. These two models differ slightly from the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model respectively and can be incorporated into the latter two. The distractor inhibition model was the dominant model until recent contradicting findings pointed to a retrieval mechanism in negative priming.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; The episode retrieval model is gaining more support for the memory based negative priming but lacks in its explanation of the association tags. Perhaps, further research exploring both these models may help to better understand the role of negative priming in attention, memory and cognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">The ''' New Man ''' is a [[utopia]]n concept that involves the creation of a new ideal human being or [[citizen]] replacing un-ideal human beings or citizens. The meaning of a New Man has widely varied and various alternatives have been suggested by a variety of religions and political ideologies, including [[Christianity]], [[communism]], [[classical liberalism]], [[fascism]], and [[utopian socialism]].

==Philosophical and religious versions==

===Christian New Man===
The doctrines of [[Paul the Apostle]] speak of [[Adam]] both as the fallen "Old Adam" and a "New Adam" as referring collectively to the fallen Old Man of humanity and a resurrected "New Man" (Ephesians 2:15, The Holy Bible) following [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung Hoon Kim, Chŏng-hun Kim. ''The significance of clothing imagery in the Pauline Corpus''. New York, New York, USA: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004. Pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzschean ''Übermensch''===
Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of an ''[[Übermensch]]'' ("Overman") was that of a New Man who would be a leader by example to humanity through an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[will to power]] that was [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and [[Irrationalism|irrationalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Stralen. ''Choices and conflict: essays on literature and existentialism''. Pp. Brussels, Belgium: Peter Lang, 2005. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche developed the concept in response to his view of the [[herd mentality]] of and inherent [[nihilism]] of Christianity, and the void in existential meaning that is realized with the [[death of God]]. The Übermensch emerges as the new meaning of the Earth, a norm-repudiating individual who overcomes himself and is the master in control of his impulses and passions.

==Political versions==

===Liberal New Man===
[[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Godwin]] believed that the spread of liberalism in [[France]] and the [[United States]] constituted the birth of a New Man and a new era.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopian Socialist New Man===
[[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]] such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] saw a future [[Golden Age]] led by a New Man who would reconstruct society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist New Man===
{{see also|New Soviet man}}
[[Marxism]], though heavily critical of [[utopianism]], postulates the development of a New Man and New Woman in a [[communist society]] following the values of a non-essential nature of the state and the importance of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated]] work for the affirmation of a person's humanity. Marxism does not see the New Man/Woman as a goal or prerequisite for achieving full communism, but rather as a product of the social conditions of pure communism. [[Che Guevara]]'s essay "Socialism and man in [[Cuba]]" and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' are two examples of the 'new man' archetype in socialist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm|title=Socialism and man in Cuba|first=Che|last=Guevara|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist New Man===
[[Fascism]] supports the creation of a New Man who is a figure of action, violence, and [[masculinity]], committed as a component of a disciplined mass that has shorn itself of [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006.

[[Transhumanism]] welcomes the creation of a literal ''new man'' by enhancements through cybernetics and other "human enhancements", and look to the [[Transhumanism#Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity|singularity]] as that point in time when the new man arrives, his birthday if you will.  Scholar [[Klaus Vondung]] argues that Transhumanism represents the final revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364|title=Revolutions: Finished and Unfinished, From Primal to Final|first1=Paul|last1=Caringella|first2=Wayne|last2=Cristaudo|first3=Glenn|last3=Hughes|date=21 February 2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have made similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5|title=New man in utopian and transhumanist perspective|first=Richard|last=Saage|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Futures Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3rABgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 Knowing New Biotechnologies: Social Aspects of Technological Convergence], p. 77-91&lt;/ref&gt;

It challenges the "New Man" ideologies listed here and deprecates the [[Viral phenomenon|meme]] of encouraging [[conformity]] via [[Normative social influence|societal pressure]].

'''#NotAllMen''' is a popular [[Internet meme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Ferdy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10924854/Is-there-a-misogynist-inside-every-man.html |title=Is there a misogynist inside every man? |website=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |location=London, England|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jezebel/&gt; It is a shortened [[hashtag]] version of the phrase '''not all men are like that''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mina|last=Malik-Hussain|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/columns/02-Jun-2014/clapping-with-both-hands|title=Clapping with Both Hands|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]||publisher=Nawa-i-Waqt Group of Publications|location=Karachi, Pakistan|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes abbreviated '''NAMALT'''.

A [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] article on the subject states that "Not all men" was previously stated as an object of frustration, but in early 2014 it became usually used as an object of mockery. Intended to counter [[generalization]]s about men’s behavior, the phrase has been criticized for deflecting conversations from uncomfortable topics, such as [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jess|last=Zimmerman |url=http://time.com/79357/not-all-men-a-brief-history-of-every-dudes-favorite-argument/ |title=Not All Men: A Brief History of Every Dude's Favorite Argument |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michel|last1=Martin|first2=Arthur|last2= Chu|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/30/317361633/jeopardy-champ-arthur-chu-on-nerds-entitlement-and-elliot-rodger|title=Jeopardy Champ Arthur Chu On Nerds, Entitlement And Elliot Rodger |work=[[NPR]]|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Vox (website)|Vox]] states that the phrase "not all men are like that," as a general defense of men in gendered criticisms of their behavior, has been around for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="vox.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelsey|last=McKinney|title=Here's why women have turned the "not all men" objection into a meme|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5720332/heres-why-women-have-turned-the-not-all-men-objection-into-a-meme|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It has been used as early as 1836 in author [[Charles Dickens]]' book ''The Pickwick Papers'', in which, in response to the statement "Men are such deceivers" by Miss Wardle, Mr. Tupman replies "They are, they are, but not all men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Dickens|authorlink=Charles Dickens|title=The Pickwick Papers|publisher=Hueber|location=Munich, Germany|date=1905|isbn=978-1718847675|title-link=The Pickwick Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Before 2013, "not all men" was not seen as a derailment tactic; the most common strategies cited by feminist bloggers were "'what about the men?' and 'patriarchy hurts men too'—pleas for inclusion, not for exemption".&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt; Jasmine Bailey says the "not all men" argument "seemingly began as a sincere way to counter feminist arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jasmine|last=Bailey|title=What’s up with the #YesAllWomen and #NotAllMen hashtags?|url=http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/whats-yesallwomen-and-notallmen-hashtags/nf7LF/|website=[[Springfield News-Sun]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|location=Springfield, Ohio|date=May 25, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; #NotAllMen, however, is often impugned by [[feminists]].  The #NotAllMen [[Twitter]] hashtag was tweeted as early as 2011. The first viral tweet with this phrase, which was not yet a hashtag, was a satirical tweet by Shafiqah Hudson in February 2013: "ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men."&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=sassycrass|author=Shafiquah Hudson|number=304432121223716864|title=ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men.|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical "Not-All-Man", barging into a conversation criticizing male behavior, was caricatured in a comic by artist Matt Lubchansky on April 14, 2014.&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Lubchansky|title=Save Me|website = Please Listen to Me|url=http://www.listen-tome.com/save-me/|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lubchansky’s comic was quickly retweeted and otherwise shared by several male celebrities including [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Matt Fraction]], and [[John Scalzi]].&lt;ref name="Jess Zimmerman"/&gt;

==2014 Isla Vista killings==
{{see also|2014 Isla Vista killings|YesAllWomen}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;NotAllMen was already a [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] created by the Twitter user Sassycrass before the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], but it gained additional traction after the event, because of the hatred against women expressed by the shooter, [[Elliot Rodger]]. In response to the hashtag #NotAllMen, an anonymous female Twitter user created the hashtag #YesAllWomen, to express that all women are affected by sexism and [[misogyny]], even though not all men are sexist. This newly created hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexual discrimination and attacks.&lt;ref&gt;For coverage of this topic, see the following sources:

==Bengaluru incident==

After reports of a mass molestation occurring at India’s Bengaluru New Year’s Eve celebration, #NotAllMen began trending on Twitter. This drew an angry reaction from women, with many Indian feminists and women strongly criticizing the hashtag while responding with their own hashtag #YesAllWomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Arielle|last=De Bono|url= http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/news-and-views/yesallwomen-resurfaces-in-india-in-the-wake-of-mass-molestation-20170104-gtm76i.html?deviceType=text | title = #YesAllWomen resurfaces in India in the wake of mass molestation|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|location=Sydney, Australia| date= 8 January 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annanya|last=Bhattacharya|url= https://qz.com/876967/notallmen-is-not-an-appropriate-response-to-a-mob-molesting-scores-of-women-in-indias-silicon-valley/ | title = #NotAllMen is not an appropriate response to a mob molesting scores of women in India’s Silicon Valley| website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz India]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|location=New York City|date= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andre|last=Borges|url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/andreborges/women-are-hitting-back-at-the-not-all-men-response-to-the-ma | title = People Are Furious At The "Not All Men" Response To The Mass Molestation In Bengaluru On NYE | website=[[Buzzfeed]]|date= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

As Kelsey McKinney of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] states, "The phrase has been reappropriated by feminists and turned into a meme meant to parody its pervasiveness and bad faith."&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt; #NotAllMen-related memes include references to [[Aquaman]], ''[[Adventure Time]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', and the [[Kool Aid Man]] crashing through a wall to exclaim "not all men".&lt;ref name="jezebel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Guide to 'Not All Men,' the Best Meme on the Internet|website= [[Jezebel.com]]|author=Erin Gloria Ryan |url=http://jezebel.com/your-guide-to-not-all-men-the-best-meme-on-the-interne-1573535818|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of the NotAllMen hashtag came from Hillary Di Menna of ''[[This (Canadian magazine)|This Magazine]]'', who claimed that: "Saying 'not all men' is not helpful. We need to listen and we need to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menna |first=Hillary Di |url=http://this.org/blog/2014/07/14/gender-block-slutwalk-toronto-2014/ |title=Gender Block: SlutWalk Toronto 2014 &amp;#124; This Magazine |publisher=This.org |date=2011-04-03 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slate Magazine]] writer Phil Plait wrote that the hashtag was {{Quote|not an unexpected response. However, it’s also not a helpful one. Why is it not helpful to say "not all men are like that"?  For lots of reasons. For one, women know this. They already know not every man is a rapist, or a murderer, or violent. They don’t need you to tell them. Second, it’s defensive. When people are defensive, they aren’t listening to the other person; they’re busy thinking of ways to defend themselves. I watched this happen on Twitter, over and again. Third, the people saying it aren’t furthering the conversation, they’re sidetracking it. The discussion isn’t about the men who aren’t a problem. (Though, I’ll note, it can be. I’ll get back to that.) Instead of being defensive and distracting from the topic at hand, try staying quiet for a while and actually listening to what the thousands upon thousands of women discussing this are saying. Fourth—and this is important, so listen carefully—when a woman is walking down the street, or on a blind date, or, yes, in an elevator alone, she doesn’t know which group you’re in. You might be the potential best guy ever in the history of history, but there’s no way for her to know that. A fraction of men out there are most definitely not in that group. Which are you? Inside your head you know, but outside your head it’s impossible to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/05/27/not_all_men_how_discussing_women_s_issues_gets_derailed.html |title=Not All Men: How Discussing Women’s Issues Gets Derailed; |publisher=Slate.com |date=2014-05-27 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In a differing opinion, [[India Times]] writer Sumeet Keswani writes that the statement "does not serve to derail the feminism movement; it seeks to draw the line between feminism and [[misandry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keswani|first1=Suweet|title=Why #NotAllMen is part of the feminist movement, not against it|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sumeet-keswani-blog/why-notallmen-is-part-of-the-feminist-movement-not-against-it/|website=indiatimes.com|publisher=India Times|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paolo Cirio''' is a [[conceptual artist]], [[hacktivist]] and [[cultural critic]].

Cirio's work embodies [[hacker ethics]], such as open access, privacy policies, and disrupting economic, legal, and political models. He received a number of legal threats for his Internet art performances with practices such as hacking, piracy, leaking sensitive information, identity theft, and cyber attacks.

Paolo Cirio is known for having exposed over 200,000 [[Cayman Islands]] offshore firms with the work ''Loophole for All''[https://paolocirio.net/work/loophole-for-all/] in 2013; the hacking of Facebook through publishing 1 million users on a dating website with ''Face to Facebook'' in 2011; the theft of 60000 financial news articles with ''Daily Paywall''[https://paolocirio.net/work/daily-paywall/] in 2014 and of e-books from Amazon.com with ''Amazon Noir''[https://paolocirio.net/work/amazon-noir/] in 2006; defrauding Google with ''GWEI''[https://paolocirio.net/work/gwei/] in 2005; and the obfuscation of 15 million U.S. criminal records with ''Obscurity''[https://paolocirio.net/work/obscurity/] in 2016. His early works include his cyber attacks against [[NATO]] and reporting on its military operations since 2001[http://paolocirio.net/work/nato_cyber_attack/]. 

==Career==
Paolo Cirio has won a number of awards, including [[Prix Ars Electronica|Golden Nica]] first prize at [[Ars Electronica]] in 2013; the [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] Fellowship in 2012; and [[Transmediale]] second prize 2008, among others.

Cirio has exhibited in international museums and institutions, he regularly gives public lectures and workshops at leading universities, and his artworks have been covered by hundreds of media outlets worldwide.

==2001 - 2004==
In 2002, Cirio's first international action was called Anti-NATO Day. As an act of [[Hacktivism]] he staged a [[virtual sit-in]] ([[DDoS]] attack) in the [[NATO]] website through a [[Flash Player]] script. The [[Canadian Department of National Defence]] investigated the action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=IWS INFOCON | first= | title=OCIPEP Daily Brief Number: DOB02-071 | publisher=The Information Warfare Site | url=http://www.mail-archive.com/infocon@infowarrior.org/msg00067.html | location= | date=30 May 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Eisenhower Institute]] used it as a case study to identify future vulnerabilities in space security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[Eisenhower Institute]] | first= | title=Space Security 2013 | publisher=[[Eisenhower Institute]] | location=Washington, D.C, | year=2004 | isbn=0920231365 | page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirio promoted the action through an [[anti-war]] web portal called StopTheNato.org, which he launched in 2001 and updated periodically until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Politics of Globalization. | publisher=SAGE | year=2009 | isbn=9788178299471 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cirio joined the Illegal Art Show network, which organized street art happenings in Italy in line with the [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]-philosophy. They occupied public spaces and invited artists to create artwork. Cirio created several [[street art]] pieces &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ullrich | first=Andreas | title=International Sticker Award | publisher=Wildsmile Studios | location=Berlin | year=2006 | isbn=978-3-89955-151-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organized three such events independently: two in Turin in 2004 and a third in London in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jelinek | first=Alana | title=This is Not Art | publisher=I.B.Tauris | year=2013 | isbn=9781848858572 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 - 2007==
In 2005, Cirio hacked Google's [[AdSense]] service by creating [[internet bots]] for a [[click fraud]] in order to buy Google's shares with its own money. In an attempt to stop the project, Google sent a cease and desist letter to the artists mentioning legal consequences for the project.[http://www.googlewilleatitself.com/pages/google/legalletter_e.html] Cirio worked on the project ''Google Will Eat Itself'' ''(GWEI)'' in conjunction with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen. The project questioned the information monopoly of [[Google]] and its revenue model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dewey | first = Caitlin | title = Google Will Eat Itself: A Q&amp;A with the creators of a subversive, oddly timeless piece of conceptual art | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2014-03-21 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/03/21/google-will-eat-itself-a-qa-with-the-creators-of-a-subversive-oddly-timeless-piece-of-conceptual-art/ | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 he eluded the protection from [[Amazon.com]] with [[internet bots]] using the front door of the [[Amazon.com#Content search|"search inside"]] service. He scraped complete texts of books, reassembled them into PDF files, and redistributed them for free. The company refused to comment on the action.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from the lecture delivered at the University Paris 8 on 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen, Cirio created the project ''Amazon Noir'' to criticize the abuse of [[copyright laws]] for the protection of digital content.

''Face to Facebook'', ''Amazon Noir'' and ''Google Will Eat Itself'' together form the ''Hacking Monopolism Trilogy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cantz | first=Hatje | title=ORIGIN | publisher=[[Ars Electronica]] | location=Linz | year=2011 | isbn=9783775731805 | page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cirio, Paolo and Alessandro Ludovicio. 2013. ''The hacking monopolism trilogy''. ISEA International. http://hdl.handle.net/2123/9673.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 - 2010==
Between 2008 and 2010, Cirio worked on experimental storytelling which involves actors and audiences for presenting real facts and issues through fictional stories across multiple media platforms. He called this technique of documentary fiction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Campanini | first=Cristiana | title=Antologia della webletteratura | publisher=Il Foglio Letterario | location=Italy | year=2010 | isbn=9788876062643 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Recombinant Fiction."  This socially engaged genre of [[transmedia storytelling]] has resulted in two projects: ''Drowning NYC'' (2010) and ''The Big Plot'' (2009).

In 2010, in reaction to the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], Cirio created the piece ''P2P Gift Credit Card - Gift Finance''. Cirio issued thousands of illicit VISA credit cards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lechner | first =Marie | title =Credit Revolver | page = 10 | publisher =[[Libération]] | date = 2011-05-07 | url = http://www.liberation.fr/medias/01012335927-paolo-cirio-credit-revolver | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to design a creative [[monetary policy]], named "Gift Finance", which is a participatory and interest-free [[basic income guarantee]] system. In the following years, he presented the projects in relation to the economic recession and the related [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests.

==2011 - 2012==
Since 2011, Cirio has been addressing the cultural shift and mainstream media attention toward popular perceptions of privacy and ownership of public and personal information, with the projects ''Street Ghosts'', ''Persecuting.US'', and ''Face to Facebook''. The methodology used to create these artworks was eventually formalized in a series called ''Anti-Social Sculptures''.

In 2011, Cirio created ''Face to Facebook'' with Alessandro Ludovico. For this piece, Cirio scraped one million [[Facebook]] profiles, filtered them with [[artificial intelligence]] for facial recognition software, and published 250,000 of them onto Lovely-Faces.com, a mock dating website designed by Cirio, with the profiles sorted according to facial expressions. This resulted in eleven lawsuit threats, five death threats, and four legal letters from Facebook[http://www.face-to-facebook.net/legal.php]. Within a few days, the project was covered by over a thousand media outlets [http://www.face-to-facebook.net/press-coverage.php] from around the world including [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Allsop | first = Laura | title = Art 'hacktivists' take on Facebook | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 2011-02-11 | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-11/world/artists.facebook.project_1_facebook-profile-pictures-publicly-available-information | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]], [[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]], and [[Apple Daily]].

With the ''Street Ghosts'' project in 2012, Cirio recontextualized photos of individuals found on [[Google Street View]], by printing and posting life-sized pictures of people in the exact locations where they were photographed. The posters were [[wheat paste|wheatpasted]] on the walls of public buildings without authorization. These interventions took place in public spaces of several major cities, including London, Berlin, and New York. 

In 2012, his web project ''Persecuting.US'' profiled the political affiliations of over one million Americans who used Twitter during the months leading up to the United States presidential election of 2012. Cirio appropriated the data and algorithmically determined users’ political affiliations to raise awareness on voter  profiling and polarization in social bubbles  that  can be targeted for political manipulation.

==2013 - 2014==
In 2013, Cirio investigated offshore financial systems with the project ''Loophole for All''. The project made public the list of all the companies registered in the [[Cayman Islands]] for the first time, exposing tax evasion practices by counterfeiting [[Certificate of Incorporation]] documents signed with his name. This information was published on the website [http://Loophole4All.com Loophole4All.com], engaging international participation through selling the real identities of anonymous Cayman companies for 99 cents. This provocation elicited reactions from Cayman authorities and global banks as well as legal threats by multinational companies, international law firms, and local Cayman businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Paolo Cirio |year=2015 |date= |title= Loophole4All.com by Paolo Cirio in Manchester at FutureEverything 2015 - Loophole for All | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMT-2yW6Dsk |format= |medium= |publisher=FutureEverything |location=Manchester |accessdate=2015-02-26 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three weeks of selling conceptual and subversive artworks in the form of limited editions of firms’ identities, [[PayPal]] suspended the account, claiming the sales activity was in violation of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|people=Laura Flanders | date=15 April 2013 |title=Tax Loopholes for All! |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/173826/tax-loopholes-all# |publisher=''The Nation''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|people=Yanyan Huang |date=7 January 2014 |title=Paolo Cirio Discovers a Tax Loophole for All |url=http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/paolo-cirio-loophole-for-all/ |publisher=''The Wild'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209040639/http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/paolo-cirio-loophole-for-all/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014 the project won the [[Prix Ars Electronica|Golden Nica]], first prize of [[Prix Ars Electronica]].

In 2014, Cirio created the ''Global Direct'' project, a creative [[political philosophy]] that the artist outlined for worldwide [[participatory democracy]] within the potentials offered by the Internet. To illustrate the conceptual work, the artist drew a series of fifteen [[Organizational chart]] to inspire values and functions for a global and participatory society. The fifteen diagrams of ''Global Direct'' were informed by the artist’s research into the [[social science]] of ancient, contemporary, and [[emergent democracy]].

In 2014 Cirio created ''Daily Paywall'' by hacking the [[paywall]] of The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Economist. Through his paid subscriptions and [[Scripting language]] hack, he obtained over 60,000 news articles published during the course of 2014. The [[pay-per-view]] content was republished for free on the website [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com] and the artist proposed to pay people to read featured financial news articles. Cirio conceived a provocative [[sharing economy]] model, where [[crowdsource]] practices were put in place to allow and incentivize people to access information on global economic matters. Using this system, readers were able to earn money for every quiz they correctly completed, and journalists were able to claim compensation for their work. Everyone could donate any amount to [[crowdfund]] the system. After a few days, the ISP hosting [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com] disabled the site after receiving complaints of international [[Copyright infringement]] from [[Pearson PLC]], the largest education and publisher company in the world and owner of the Financial Times and The Economist. Additionally The Wall Street Journal proceeded to terminate the artist’s subscription due to a violation of their Terms of Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Paolo Cirio |year=2015 |date= |title=FutureEverything 2015: Paolo Cirio | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYRubeOE8Sk |format= |medium= |publisher=FutureEverything |location=Manchester |accessdate=2015-04-26 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] sold both The Economist and the Financial Times and Cirio republished the whole content of [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com]. He entire artistic act was pre-scripted as a performance for illustrating critical issues on the [[Information economy]] that Cirio outlined within the launch of the project.

==2015 - 2016==
During the spring of 2015, Cirio conducted the street art campaign ''OVEREXPOSED'' concerning the aftermath of [[Edward Snowden]]’s [[global surveillance disclosures]]. He disseminated on public walls unauthorized photos of high-ranking U.S. intelligence officials of the [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and [[FBI]], who were accountable for political measures or advocacy for mass surveillance and espionage programs. The photos, mostly [[selfies]] from Facebook and Twitter accounts of civilians, were rendered with a particular technique called ''High Definition Stencils'' invented by the artist for the street art campaign that took place in NYC, London, Berlin and Paris between April and May 2015. The intervention generated media coverage and public interest internationally &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Italian ‘Banksy’ exposes ‘masterminds of spying’ in street art campaign  | page = 10 | publisher =[[Russia Today]] | date = 2015-07-12 | url = http://www.rt.com/news/273196-italy-artist-nsa-surveillance/ | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in Germany &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beitzer | first =Hannah | title =Geheimdienst-Chefs ganz privat - und plötzlich öffentlich | page = | publisher =[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]] | date = 2015-05-23 | url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/kunst-gegen-ueberwachung-geheimdienst-chefs-ganz-privat-und-ploetzlich-oeffentlich-1.2491926 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Cirio created the project ''Obscurity'' in which he obfuscated over 10 million online mugshots and the criminal records of victims of [[mass incarceration]] in United States. The project addressed the unregulated [[mug shot publishing industry]] that anonymous internet companies exploit in order to shame and blackmail people who have been arrested in the U.S. regardless of their charges and trial verdicts. Cirio targeted six mugshot websites and blurred millions of mugshots and shuffled names listed. In response he received support from mugshot extortion victims and was subject to a legal threat from Mugshots.com, an anonymous firm in [[Nevis]], and US Data ltd., a Texan firm owning a few mugshot websites. With ''Obscurity'', Cirio questioned the [[Right to Be Forgotten]] law, which has been opposed by major search engine companies in the U.S. Ultimately, to point out the accountability of search engines in exposing personal sensitive information, Cirio designed the campaign ''Right2Remove.us'' to introduce a privacy policy adapting the [[Right to Be Forgotten]] law to the United States. With the ''Right to Remove'' policy, Cirio suggested types of sensitive personal data that should be removed from online search results to protect specific categories of vulnerable individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3647">The '''Paradise of Fools''' is a literary and historical topic and theme found in many Christian works. A traditional train of thought held that it is the place where fools or idiots were sent after death: intellectually incompetent to be held responsible for their deeds, they cannot be punished for them in [[hell]], atone for them in [[purgatory]], or be rewarded for them in [[heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 669.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually to be read allegorically, though what precisely is allegorized differs from author to author,&lt;ref name=Treip&gt;Treip 134, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; and often its location is in the lunar sphere.

==Milton==
One of the most notable examples of the Paradise of Fools is found in Book 3 of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', where Milton, in the narrative of Satan's journey to Earth, reserves a space for future fools (Milton also calls it the "Limbo of Vanity"), specifically Catholic clergy and "fleeting wits".&lt;ref name=Treip/&gt; Milton's satirical allegory in turn was inspired by [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516); [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'', stated that the allegory "disgraced" Milton's epic.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestry of Milton's Paradise of Fools includes Canto XXXIV of ''Orlando'' and [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. As John Wooten argued, that canto in ''Orlando'' contains a summarizing critique of Dante's entire ''Comedy''—a descent into Hell, followed by an ascent to a mountain top (Dante's Earthly Paradise) and a flight to the moon: "with the greatest ironic debunking, the moon ... is Ariosto's allegorical substitute for the complex theology and metaphysics of Dante's ''Paradiso''".&lt;ref&gt;Wooten 745.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Milton's Paradise of Fools builds on Ariosto's mock version of Dante's ''Comedy'', but adds a specifically anti-Catholic aspect by making fun of hermits, friars, Dominicans, Franciscans—those equipped with "Reliques, Beads, / Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls". Central is the punishment of vanity; it is the place for "all things transitory and vain, when Sin / With vanity had fill'd the works of men: / Both all things vain, and all who in vain things / Built thir fond hopes of Glory or lasting fame" (III.446-49). Milton also "corrects" Ariosto; the Paradise of Fools is "Not in the neighboring Moon, as some have dream'd" (III.459)--a "mock correction", as Wooten calls it.&lt;ref&gt;Wooten 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Promession''' is an idea of how to dispose [[Disposal of human corpses|human remains]] by way of [[freeze drying]]. The concept of promession was developed by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[biologist]] Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, who derived the name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "promise" (''promessa'').&lt;ref name=holst&gt;{{cite news|last=Holst|first=Karen|title=Swedish green-burial firm to turn frozen corpses in compost|url=http://www.thelocal.se/33178/20110413/|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She founded [[Promessa Organic]]&amp;nbsp;[[Aktiebolag|AB]] in 1997 to commercially pursue her idea.&lt;ref name=undertaker&gt;{{cite news|last=McNally|first=Patrick|title=Promession: A Return to the Living Soil|url=http://www.dailyundertaker.com/2008/09/promession-return-to-living-soil.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Undertaker|date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was liquidated 2015 without being able to produce a functioning facility. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/orust/promessa-slutligen-i-konkurs-1.925619|title=Promessa slutligen i konkurs|work=Bohusläningen|access-date=2018-09-12|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of promession is questioned and not a functional method according to critics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=3818201|title=Ekologisk begravning - Studio Ett|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Promession involves five steps:
# [[Coffin]] separation: the body is placed into the chamber
# Cryogenic freezing: [[liquid nitrogen]] at −196 [[°C]] crystallizes the body
# Vibration: the body is disintegrated into particles within minutes
# Freeze drying: particles are freeze dried in a drying chamber, leaving approximately 30% of the original weight
# Metal separation: any metals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;tooth [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[Hip replacement|artificial hip]]s, etc.) are removed, either by magnetism or by sieving. The dry powder is placed in a [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] [[casket]] which is interred in the top [[Soil horizon|layers of soil]], where aerobic bacteria decompose the remains into [[humus]] in as little as 6–12 months.

== Criticism ==
Promession as a functional method is questioned. No facility for promession has been built or put into service. Critics argue that there is a physical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760982426|title=Hej då! : begravningsboken|last=1938-|first=Möller, Lotte,|date=2011|publisher=Arena|isbn=9789178433612|location=Malmö|oclc=760982426}}&lt;/ref&gt; impossibility to atomize a freeze dried human body in this way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20120525113929/http://www.ostran.se/nyheter/kalmar/promession_fungerar_inte|title=- Promession fungerar inte / Kalmar / NYHETER / ÖSTRAN / Östra Smålan…|date=2012-05-25|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''semimodule''' over a [[semiring]] ''R'' is like a [[module (mathematics)|module over a ring]] except that it is only a [[commutative monoid]] rather than an [[abelian group]].

==Definition==
Formally, a '''left''' ''R''-'''semimodule''' consists of an additively-written commutative monoid ''M'' and a map from &lt;math&gt;R \times M&lt;/math&gt; to ''M'' satisfying the following axioms:
# &lt;math&gt;r (m + n) = rm + rn&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(r + s) m = rm + sm&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(rs)m = r(sm)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;1m = m&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0_R m = r 0_M = 0_M&lt;/math&gt;.

A right ''R''-semimodule can be defined similarly. For modules over a ring, the last axiom follows from the others. This is not the case with semimodules.

==Examples==
If ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], then any ''R''-module is an ''R''-semimodule. Conversely, it follows from the second, fourth, and last axioms that (-1)''m'' is an additive inverse of ''m'' for all &lt;math&gt;m \in M&lt;/math&gt;, so any semimodule over a ring is in fact a module.
Any semiring is a left and right semimodule over itself in the same way that a ring is a left and right module over itself. Every commutative monoid is uniquely an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;-semimodule in the same way that an abelian group is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module.

[[Image:tetrahedron.png|thumb|A regular 3-simplex or [[tetrahedron]]]]
In [[geometry]], a '''simplex''' (plural: '''simplexes''' or '''simplices''') is a generalization of the notion of a [[triangle]] or [[tetrahedron]] to arbitrary [[dimensions]].
Specifically, a '''''k''-simplex''' is a ''k''-dimensional [[polytope]] which is the [[convex hull]] of its ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]].  
More formally, suppose the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points &lt;math&gt;u_0,\dots, u_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[affinely independent]], which means &lt;math&gt; u_1 - u_0,\dots, u_k-u_0 &lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]].
Then, the simplex determined by them is the set of points

:&lt;math&gt; C = \left\{\theta_0 u_0 + \dots +\theta_k u_k ~\bigg|~ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \theta_i=1 \mbox{ and } \theta_i \ge 0 \mbox{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, and a 4-simplex is a [[5-cell]].  A single [[point (geometry)|point]] may be considered a 0-simplex, and a [[line segment]] may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest [[convex set]] containing the given vertices.

A '''regular simplex'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Elte | first = E. L. | title = The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher = University of Groningen | location = Groningen | year = 1912}} Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope&lt;/ref&gt; is a simplex that is also a [[regular polytope]]. A regular ''n''-simplex may be constructed from a regular (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.

The '''standard simplex''' or '''probability simplex''' &lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the simplex formed from the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 standard unit vectors, or 

:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1} : x_0 + \dots + x_k = 1, x_i \ge 0, i=0, \dots, k \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[topology]] and [[combinatorics]], it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a [[simplicial complex]].  The associated combinatorial structure is called an [[abstract simplicial complex]], in which context the word “simplex” simply means any [[finite set]] of vertices.

==History==
The concept of a simplex was known to [[William Kingdon Clifford]], who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them "prime confines". 
[[Henri Poincaré]], writing about [[algebraic topology]] in 1900, called them "generalized tetrahedra".
In 1902 [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute]] described the concept first with the [[Latin]] superlative ''simplicissimum'' ("simplest") and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form ''simplex'' ("simple").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html|title=Simplex|work=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics|first=Jeff|last=Miller|accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Simplexes.jpg|alt=The four simplexes which can be fully represented in 3D space.|thumb|271x271px|The four simplexes which can be fully represented in 3D space.]]
* A 0-simplex is a [[point (mathematics)|point]].
* A 1-simplex is a [[line segment]].
* A 2-simplex is a [[triangle]].
* A 3-simplex is a [[tetrahedron]].
* A 4-simplex is a [[5-cell]].

== Elements ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Simplicial complex]] --&gt;
The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points that define an ''n''-simplex is called a '''face''' of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 defining points) is an ''m''-simplex, called an '''''m''-face''' of the ''n''-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the '''vertices''' (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the '''edges''', the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-faces are called the '''facets''', and the sole ''n''-face is the whole ''n''-simplex itself. In general, the number of ''m''-faces is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+1}{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the number of ''m''-faces of an ''n''-simplex may be found in column (''m'' + 1) of row (''n'' + 1) of [[Pascal's triangle]]. A simplex ''A'' is a '''coface''' of a simplex ''B'' if ''B'' is a face of ''A''. ''Face'' and ''facet'' can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a [[simplicial complex]]; see [[Simplicial complex#Definitions|simplical complex]] for more detail.

The '''regular simplex''' family is the first of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the other two being the [[cross-polytope]] family, labeled as ''β&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[hypercube]]s, labeled as ''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellation of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The number of 1-faces (edges) of the ''n''-simplex is the ''n''-th [[triangle number]], the number of 2-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)th [[tetrahedron number]], the number of 3-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)th 5-cell number, and so on.

An (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an ''n''-simplex and a point,&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An (''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an ''m''-simplex and an ''n''-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[isosceles triangle]] is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[equilateral triangle]] is 3&amp;middot;(&amp;nbsp;) or&amp;nbsp;{3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )∨( ) or {3}∨( ). A [[regular tetrahedron]] is 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) or {3,3} and so on.

In some conventions,&lt;ref&gt;Kozlov, Dimitry, ''Combinatorial Algebraic Topology'', 2008, Springer-Verlag (Series: Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics)&lt;/ref&gt; the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex.  The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.  This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as [[simplicial homology]]) than to the study of polytopes.

== The standard simplex ==
[[Image:2D-simplex.svg|150px|thumb|right|The standard 2-simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]
The '''standard ''n''-simplex''' (or '''unit ''n''-simplex''') is the subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n = \left\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}~\big|~\sum_{i = 0}^n t_i = 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The simplex Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; lies in the [[affine hyperplane]] obtained by removing the restriction ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 in the above definition.

The ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices of the standard ''n''-simplex are the points ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, where
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0),
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0),
:&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, 0, ..., 1).
There is a canonical map from the standard ''n''-simplex to an arbitrary ''n''-simplex with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) given by
:&lt;math&gt;(t_0,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 0}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] of a point in the ''n''-simplex.  Such a general simplex is often called an '''affine ''n''-simplex''', to emphasize that the canonical map is an [[affine transformation]]. It is also sometimes called an '''oriented affine ''n''-simplex''' to emphasize that the canonical map may be [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] or reversing.

More generally, there is a canonical map from the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex (with ''n'' vertices) onto any [[polytope]] with ''n'' vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):
:&lt;math&gt;(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 1}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as [[generalized barycentric coordinates]], and express every polytope as the ''image'' of a simplex: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{n-1} \twoheadrightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;

A commonly used function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the interior of the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex is the [[softmax function]], or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the [[standard logistic function]].

=== Examples ===

* Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the point {{nowrap|1= 1 in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[regular tetrahedron]] with vertices (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Increasing coordinates===
An alternative coordinate system is given by taking the [[indefinite sum]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= 0\\
s_1 &amp;= s_0 + t_0 = t_0\\
s_2 &amp;= s_1 + t_1 = t_0 + t_1\\
s_3 &amp;= s_2 + t_2 = t_0 + t_1 + t_2\\
&amp;\dots\\
s_n &amp;= s_{n-1} + t_{n-1} = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_{n-1}\\
s_{n+1} &amp;= s_n + t_n = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_n = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This yields the alternative presentation by ''order,'' namely as nondecreasing ''n''-tuples between 0 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_*^n = \left\{(s_1,\ldots,s_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid 0 = s_0 \leq s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \dots \leq s_n \leq s_{n+1} = 1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, this is an ''n''-dimensional subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, &lt;math&gt;t_i=0,&lt;/math&gt; here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, &lt;math&gt;s_i=s_{i+1},&lt;/math&gt; while the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] corresponds to the inequalities becoming ''strict'' (increasing sequences).

A key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the "ordered simplex" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) [[fundamental domain]] for the action of the symmetric group on the ''n''-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the ''n''! elements of the symmetric group divides the ''n''-cube into &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume &lt;math&gt;1/n!&lt;/math&gt; Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are &lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2/2,x^3/3!,\dots,x^n/n!&lt;/math&gt;

A further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.

===Projection onto the standard simplex===
Especially in numerical applications of [[probability theory]] a [[Graphical projection|projection]] onto the standard simplex is of interest. Given &lt;math&gt;\, (p_i)_i&lt;/math&gt; with possibly negative entries, the closest point &lt;math&gt;\left(t_i\right)_i&lt;/math&gt; on the simplex has coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;t_i= \max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_i\max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; can be easily calculated from sorting &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1101.6081|title=Projection Onto A Simplex |author=Yunmei Chen, Xiaojing Ye  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sorting approach takes &lt;math&gt;O( n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity, which can be improved to &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity via [[Selection algorithm|median-finding]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacUlan | first1 = N. | last2 = De Paula | first2 = G. G. | doi = 10.1016/0167-6377(89)90064-3 | title = A linear-time median-finding algorithm for projecting a vector on the simplex of n | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 219 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; ball.

===Corner of cube===
Finally, a simple variant is to replace "summing to 1" with "summing to at most 1"; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_c^n = \left\{(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n~\big|~\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i \leq 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This yields an ''n''-simplex as a corner of the ''n''-cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the [[simplex method]], which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with ''n'' facets.

==Cartesian coordinates for regular ''n''-dimensional simplex in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==
The coordinates of the vertices of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties,
# For a regular simplex, the distances of its vertices to its center are equal.
# The angle subtended by any two vertices of an ''n''-dimensional simplex through its center is &lt;math&gt;\arccos\left(\tfrac{-1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

These can be used as follows. Let vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) represent the vertices of an ''n''-simplex center the origin, all [[unit vector]]s so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the [[dot product]] between any pair of the vectors is &lt;math&gt;-1/n&lt;/math&gt;. This can be used to calculate positions for them.

For example in three dimensions the vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron. Write these as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Choose the first vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first component zero, so by the first property it must be (1, 0, 0) and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By the second property the dot product of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with all other vectors is -{{frac|1|3}}, so each of their ''x'' components must equal this, and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next choose ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first two elements zero. The second element is the only unknown. It can be calculated from the first property using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (choose any of the two square roots), and so the second vector can be completed:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The second property can be used to calculate the remaining ''y'' components, by taking the dot product of  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with each and solving to give

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From which the ''z'' components can be calculated, using the Pythagorean theorem again to satisfy the first property, the two possible square roots giving the two results

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This process can be carried out in any dimension, using ''n'' + 1 vectors, applying the first and second properties alternately to determine all the values.

== Geometric properties ==

=== Volume ===
The [[volume]] of an ''n''-simplex in ''n''-dimensional space with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \left|{1\over n!} \det
 \begin{pmatrix}
  v_1-v_0, &amp; v_2-v_0,&amp; \dots, &amp; v_n-v_0
 \end{pmatrix}\right|
&lt;/math&gt;

where each column of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[determinant]] is the difference between the [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] representing two vertices.&lt;ref&gt;A derivation of a very similar formula can be found in {{cite journal | last1 =  Stein | first1 = P. | year = 1966 | title = A Note on the Volume of a Simplex | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 299–301 | publisher =  | jstor = 2315353 | doi =   10.2307/2315353 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the [[Distance geometry#Cayley–Menger determinants|Cayley–Menger determinant]]. It can also compute the volume of a simplex embedded in a higher-dimensional space, e.g., a triangle in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Colins, Karen D. "Cayley-Menger Determinant." From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cayley-MengerDeterminant.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the 1/''n''! it is the formula for the volume of an ''n''-[[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]]. 
This can be understood as follows: Assume that ''P'' is an ''n''-parallelotope constructed on a basis &lt;math&gt;(v_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, call a list of vertices &lt;math&gt;v_0,\ v_1, \ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt; a ''n''-path if 
:&lt;math&gt;v_1 = v_0 + e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_2 = v_1 + e_{\sigma(2)},\ldots, v_n = v_{n-1}+e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; 
(so there are ''n''!&amp;nbsp;''n''-paths and &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:

If ''P'' is the unit ''n''-hypercube, then the union of the ''n''-simplexes formed by the convex hull of each ''n''-path is ''P'', and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Every ''n''-path corresponding to a permutation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the image of the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_1,\ v_0+e_1+e_2,\ldots v_0+e_1+\cdots + e_n&lt;/math&gt; by the affine isometry that sends &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt;, and whose linear part matches &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_{\sigma(i)}&lt;/math&gt; for all&amp;nbsp;''i''. hence every two ''n''-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; this explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+e_{\sigma(2)}\ldots v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+\cdots + e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0 + (x_1+\cdots +x_n) e_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + (x_{n-1}+x_n) e_{\sigma(n-1)} + x_n e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0&lt; x_i &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1+\cdots + x_n &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt; Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit ''n''-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by "&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \leq&lt;/math&gt;". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the volume of such a simplex is 

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac 1 {n!}.&lt;/math&gt;  

If ''P'' is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no more true, in dimension&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the ''n''-parallelotop is the image of the unit ''n''-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a ''n''-path is:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac{\det(e_1, \ldots, e_n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, given an ''n''-simplex &lt;math&gt;(v_0,\ v_1,\ v_2,\ldots v_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;, it can be supposed that the vectors &lt;math&gt;e_1 = v_1-v_0,\ e_2 = v_2-v_1,\ldots e_n=v_n-v_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Considering the parallelotope constructed from &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.

Finally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that 
:&lt;math&gt;\det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_0,\ldots v_n-v_0) = \det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_1,\ldots, v_n-v_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

From this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard ''n''-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
{1 \over (n+1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of a regular ''n''-simplex with unit side length is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{n!\sqrt{2^n}}
&lt;/math&gt;

as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, to get the volume under the ''n''-simplex as a function of its vertex distance ''x'' from the origin, differentiating with respect to ''x'', at &lt;math&gt;x=1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where the ''n''-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length &lt;math&gt;dx/\sqrt{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; of the increment, &lt;math&gt;(dx/(n+1),\ldots, dx/(n+1))&lt;/math&gt;, along the normal vector.

The [[dihedral angle]] of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1/''n''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | date = October 2002 | pages = 756–758 | title = An Elementary Calculation of the Dihedral Angle of the Regular ''n''-Simplex | first1 = Harold R. | last1 = Parks | author1-link = Harold R.

Wills | jstor = 3072403 | doi=10.2307/3072403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Oregon State University | date = June 2009 | title = Connections between combinatorics of permutations and algorithms and geometry | author1 = Harold R. Parks | author2 = Dean C. Wills | url = http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/11929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while its central angle is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1/''n'').

===Simplices with an "orthogonal corner"===
An "orthogonal corner" means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent [[Face (geometry)|faces]] are pairwise orthogonal. Such simplices are generalizations of right triangles and for them there exists an ''n''-dimensional version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

The sum of the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n |A_k|^2 = |A_0|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; A_1 \ldots A_n &lt;/math&gt; are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; A_0 &lt;/math&gt;, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.

For a 2-simplex the theorem is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is [[de Gua's theorem]] for a tetrahedron 
with an orthogonal corner.

===Relation to the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube===
The [[Hasse diagram]] of the face lattice of an ''n''-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[hypercube]]'s edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the ''n''-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.

The ''n''-simplex is also the [[vertex figure]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube. It is also the [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[orthoplex]].

===Topology===
[[Topology|Topologically]], an ''n''-simplex is [[topologically equivalent|equivalent]] to an [[ball (mathematics)|''n''-ball]]. Every ''n''-simplex is an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold with corners]].

===Probability===
{{Main article|Categorical distribution}}

In probability theory, the points of the standard ''n''-simplex in (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the [[categorical distribution]] on ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 possible outcomes.

===Compounds===
Since all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;

* Two triangles form a [[hexagram]] {6/2}.
* Two tetrahedra form a [[compound of two tetrahedra]] or [[stellated octahedron]].
* Two 5-cells form a [[compound of two 5-cells]] in four dimensions.

== Algebraic topology&lt;!--'Singular n-simplex' redirects here--&gt; ==
In [[algebraic topology]], simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of [[topological space]]s called [[simplicial complex]]es. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] called [[simplicial homology]].

A finite set of ''k''-simplexes embedded in an [[open subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called an '''affine ''k''-chain'''. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.

Note that each facet of an ''n''-simplex is an affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex, and thus the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of an ''n''-simplex is an affine ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1-chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=[v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n]&lt;/math&gt;

with the &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; denoting the vertices, then the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''σ'' is the chain

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n].&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator,  that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2\sigma = \partial ( ~ \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n]~ ) =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero:  &lt;math&gt; \partial ^2 \rho =0 &lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a [[manifold]] by means of smooth, differentiable map &lt;math&gt;f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the [[embedding]].  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\sum\nolimits_i a_i \sigma_i) = \sum\nolimits_i a_i f(\sigma_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity.  For the boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;, one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial f(\rho) = f (\partial \rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the [[function (mathematics)|map operation]] (by definition of a map).

A continuous map &lt;math&gt;f:\sigma\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; to a [[topological space]] ''X'' is frequently referred to as a '''singular ''n''-simplex'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. (A map is generally called "singular" if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)&lt;ref&gt;John M. Lee, ''Introduction to Topological Manifolds'', Springer, 2006, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic geometry ==
Since classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations, but not inequalities, the ''algebraic standard n-simplex'' is commonly defined as the subset of affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^n := \left\{x \in \mathbb{A}^{n+1} ~\Big|~ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i - 1 = 0\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

which equals the [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]-theoretic description &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n(R) = \operatorname{Spec}(R[\Delta^n])&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n] := R[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]\left/\left(\sum x_i -1\right)\right.&lt;/math&gt;

the ring of regular functions on the algebraic ''n''-simplex (for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;).

By using the same definitions as for the classical ''n''-simplex, the ''n''-simplices for different dimensions ''n'' assemble into one [[simplicial object]], while the rings &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n]&lt;/math&gt; assemble into one cosimplicial object &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^\bullet]&lt;/math&gt; (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).

The algebraic ''n''-simplices are used in higher [[K-theory]] and in the definition of higher [[Chow group]]s.

== Applications ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Simplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a [[ternary plot]].

In [[applied statistics#industrial|industrial statistics]], simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such [[mixture]]s, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using [[response surface methodology]], and then a local maximum can be computed using a [[nonlinear programming]] method, such as [[sequential quadratic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[operations research]], [[linear programming]] problems can be solved by the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig]].

In [[geometric design]] and [[computer graphics]],  many methods first perform simplicial [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]]s of the domain and then  [[interpolation|fit interpolating]] [[polynomial and rational function modeling|polynomials]] to each simplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vondran | first = Gary L. |date=April 1998 | title = Radial and Pruned Tetrahedral Interpolation Techniques | journal = HP Technical Report | volume = HPL-98-95 | pages = 1–32 | url = http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-95.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the hydrides of most elements in the [[p-block]] can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. [[Neon]] does not react with hydrogen and as such is [[Monatomic gas|a point]], [[fluorine]] bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, [[oxygen]] bonds with two hydrogen in a [[Bent molecular geometry|bent]] fashion resembling a triangle, [[nitrogen]] reacts to form a [[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|tetrahedron]], and [[carbon]] will form [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|a structure]] resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen is replaced by [[halogen]] atoms.

'''Stochastic electrodynamics''' ('''SED''') is an extension of the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], with the electromagnetic [[Zero-point energy|zero-point field]] (ZPF) playing a central role as the guiding [[pilot-wave]].

Given the posited emergent nature of quantum laws in SED, it has been argued that they form a kind of "quantum equilibrium" that has an analogous status to that of thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics. In principle therefore, SED allows other "[[quantum non-equilibrium]]" distributions, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local ([[Faster-than-light|superluminal]]) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.&lt;ref name="Valentini2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentini|first1=Antony|title=Beyond the quantum|journal=Physics World|volume=22|issue=11|year=2009|pages=32–37|issn=0953-8585|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/22/11/36|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2758v1.pdf|arxiv=1001.2758|bibcode=2009PhyW...22k..32V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musser|first1=George|title=Cosmological Data Hint at a Level of Physics Underlying Quantum Mechanics|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/cosmological-data-hint-at-a-level-of-physics-underlying-quantum-mechanics-guest-post/|website=blogs.scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that [[inertia]] is one such emergent law.&lt;ref name="HaischRueda1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haisch|first1=Bernhard|last2=Rueda|first2=Alfonso|last3=Puthoff|first3=H.

==Classical background field==

The background field is introduced as a [[Lorentz force]] in the (classical) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation (see: [[Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force]]), where the classical statistics of the electric and magnetic fields and quadratic combinations thereof are chosen to match the vacuum expectation values of the equivalent operators in QED. The field is generally represented as a discrete sum of [[Fourier series|Fourier components]] each with amplitude and phase that are independent classical random variables, distributed so that the statistics of the fields are isotropic and unchanged under boosts. This prescription is such that each Fourier mode at frequency (f) is expected to have an energy of hf/2, equaling that of the ground state of the vacuum modes of QED. Unless [[cutoff frequency|cut off]], the total field has an infinite energy density, with a spectral energy density (per unit frequency per unit volume) [2h/c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]f&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; where h is [[Planck's constant]]. Consequently, the background field is a classical version of the electromagnetic ZPF of QED, though in SED literature the field is commonly referred to simply as 'the ZPF' without making that distinction. It should be noted that any finite cutoff frequency of the field itself would be incompatible with Lorentz invariance.  For this reason, some researchers prefer to think of cutoff frequency in terms of the response of particles to the field rather than as a property the field itself.

==Brief history==
{{Quantum mechanics|Interpretations}}
Stochastic electrodynamics is a term for a collection of research efforts of many different styles based on the [[ansatz]] that there exists a [[Lorentz invariant]] random [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The basic ideas have been around for a long time; but Marshall (1963) and Brafford seem to have been the originators of the more concentrated efforts starting in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marshall, T.

A separate thread has been the investigation of an earlier proposal by [[Walther Nernst]] attempting to use the SED notion of a classical ZPF to explain ''inertial mass'' as due to a vacuum reaction.

In 2000, Trevor Marshall derived an experimental prediction of SED dubbed "spontaneous parametric up-conversion" (SPUC) as a dual process to the well-known [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] (SPDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Marshall |first=Trevor W. |author-link= |eprint=quant-ph/0203042 |title=Nonlocality - The party may be over |date=9 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPUC was tested in 2009 and 2010 with positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Jinyu |last2=Zhang |first2=Shian |last3=Jia |first3=Tianqing |last4=Wang |first4=Zugeng |last5=Sun |first5=Zhenrong |title=Femtosecond spontaneous parametric upconversion and downconversion in a quadratic nonlinear medium |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B |date=2009 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=549–553 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.26.000549 |bibcode = 2009JOSAB..26..549S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.

In 2010, Cavalleri ''et al.'' introduced SEDS ('pure' SED, as they call it, plus spin) as a fundamental improvement which they claim potentially overcomes all the known drawbacks to SED. They also claim SEDS resolves four observed effects that are so far unexplained by QED, i.e., 1) the physical origin of the ZPF, and its natural upper cutoff; 2) an anomaly in experimental studies of the [[Neutrino#Mass|neutrino rest mass]]; 3) the origin and quantitative treatment of 1/f noise; and 4) the high-energy tail (~ 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; eV) of [[cosmic rays]].

Inconclusive but encouraging experiments were carried out in 2012 by Dmitriyeva and Moddel in which emissions in "... infrared was clearly observed" which they could not explain using "...conventional thermodynamic models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Olga Dmitriyeva and Garret Moddel |year=2012 |title=Test of zero-point energy emission from gases flowing through Casimir cavities  |journal=Physics Procedia |volume=38 |pages=8–17 |doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.007 |bibcode = 2012PhPro..38....8D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Auñon et al. showed that Casimir and Van der Waals interactions are a particular case of stochastic forces from electromagnetic sources when the broad Planck's spectrum is chosen and the wavefields are non-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Juan Miguel Auñon, Cheng Wei Qiu and Manuel Nieto-Vesperinas |year=2013 |title=Tailoring photonic forces on a magnetodielectric nanoparticle with a fluctuating optical source |journal=Physical Review A |volume=88 |page=043817 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.88.043817|bibcode = 2013PhRvA..88d3817A |url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/95567/1/Tailoring%20photonic%20forces.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing fluctuating partially coherent light emitters with a tailored spectral energy distribution in the optical range, this establishes the link between stochastic electrodynamics and [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Leonard Mandel and Emil Wolf |title=Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1995|isbn=9780521417112}}&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth putting forward a way to optically create and control both such zero-point fields as well as Lifshitz forces &lt;ref&gt;E.

In addition, this opens the path to build many more stochastic forces on employing narrow-band light sources for bodies with frequency-dependent responses.

In a 2014 dissertation Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Henriques measured the energy shift in the atomic levels of Xe atoms as they passed through nano-porous Casimir membranes. Some evidence of anomalous radiation were observed, however, he was not able to distinguish this radiation conclusively from the background due to said shortcomings in the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/jspui/bitstream/10316/28082/1/ZPF_extraction_last.pdf |year=2014 |title=Study of atomic energy shifts induced by Casimir cavities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of SED==
SED has been used in attempts to provide a ''classical'' explanation for effects previously considered to require quantum mechanics (here restricted to the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] and QED) for their explanation. It has also been used to motivate a classical ZPF-based underpinning for gravity and inertia. There is no universal agreement on the successes and failures of SED, either in its congruence with standard theories of quantum mechanics, QED, and gravity, or in its compliance with observation. The following SED-based explanations are relatively uncontroversial and are free of criticism at the time of writing:
*The [[Casimir effect]]&lt;ref&gt;QED-based calculations commonly implicitly adopt the SED ansatz to compute Casimir forces. See for example {{cite book|authors=C. Itzykson and J-B. Zuber |title=Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-486-44568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero point energy==
According to Haisch and Rueda, inertia arises as an ''electromagnetic drag force'' on accelerating particles, produced by interaction with the zero-point field.  In their 1998 Ann. Phys. paper (see citations), they speak of a "Rindler flux", presumably meaning the Unruh effect, and claim to have computed a nonzero ''"z.p.f. momentum"''.  This computation rests upon their claim to compute a nonzero ''"z.p.f. Poynting vector"''.

These proposals for [[zero-point energy]] suggest a source of low or no cost [[perpetual motion|free energy]] from the vacuum as well as the hope of developing a [[reactionless drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. A. Robertson, P. A. Murad and E.

'''Street harassment''' is a form of [[sexual harassment]] that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking,
[[wolf-whistling]]s, '''catcalling''', exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying Via Social Media|journal=[[Journal of School Violence]]|last1=Whittaker|first1=Elizabeth|author2=Robin M. Kowalski|date=2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–29|doi=10.1080/15388220.2014.949377}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the founder of the non-profit organization ''Stop Street Harassment'', it can also consist of physically harmless behavior, such as "kissing noises" and "non-sexually explicit comments," to "more threatening behavior" like stalking, flashing, sexual assault, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stop Street Harassment: Making Public Places Safe and Welcoming for Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|publisher=Praeger|year=2010|isbn=978-0313384967|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients include people of all genders, but women are much more commonly victims of harassment by men. According to ''Harvard Law Review'' (1993), street harassment is considered harassment done primarily by male strangers to females in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Cynthia Grant|date=January 1993|title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=106|pages=519|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers from Cornell University and [[Hollaback!]] conducted the largest international cross-cultural study on street harassment. The data suggests that the majority of females have their first street harassment experience during puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihollaback.org/cornell-international-survey-on-street-harassment/|title=Street Harassment: The Largest International Cross-Cultural Study|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=hollaback!|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of South Asia, public sexual harassment of women is called "[[eve teasing]]". The Spanish term ''piropos'' most widely used in Mexico holds a similar effect. Studies show that what is considered street harassment is similar around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kissling|first=Elizabeth|date=1991|title=Street harassment: The Language of Sexual Terrorism|jstor=42888749|journal=Discourse and Society|volume=2|issue=4|pages=457–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many perpetrators of these actions would not characterize them as harassment, though most recipients would. Harassment can also be disproportionately directed at those with what is perceived by passers-by as a non-typical [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is street harassment?|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/what-is-street-harassment/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking photos of strangers without permission, as [[street photography]] and [[photojournalism]] practitioners do, is not considered street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kearl|first1=Holly|title=Stop Global Street Harassment: Growing Activism Around the World|date=August 2015|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is no definitive beginning of street harassment, but discussion regarding the subject began in 1944 with the rape of [[Recy Taylor]]. Rosa Parks was commissioned to investigate the crime in which Taylor, a black woman, was kidnapped and gang raped in Abbeville, Alabama. Parks responded by starting what was later dubbed the "strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dailey|first=Jane|date=2011|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance—A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, by Danielle L. McGuire|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=2|issue=2|pages=490–491|doi=10.1093/jahist/jar290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement called Take Back the Night gained traction. This movement, still strongly represented today, is an international protest against sexual violence against women. Take Back the Night has become a non-profit organization that aims to end all forms of sexual violence, including street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://takebackthenight.org/about-us/|title=About – Take Back the Night|website=takebackthenight.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the "Wall Street Ogle-In" took place. Led by [[Karla Jay]], women marched on Wall Street with signs addressing street harassment. As a role reversal, the women catcalled the men they passed in hopes of raising awareness of the unpleasant nature of the street harassment women experience daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blogs/when-womens-lib-vindicated-wall-streets-original-joan-holloway.htm|title=How Wall Street's Original Joan Holloway Inspired Second-Wave Feminist Protests|date=2015-08-25|work=Stuff Mom Never Told You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Deirdre Davis wrote an academic article that helped clarify what street harassment is by explaining its five characteristics: 1) it takes place in a public space, 2) it most commonly occurs between men and women, 3) saying "thank you" to a harasser provokes further harassment, 4) comments often pertain to what cannot be seen on the woman's body, and 5) the harasser's comments, though disguised as compliments, are objectifying and derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Deirdre,|date=1994-01-01|title=The Harm That Has No Name: Street Harassment, Embodiment, and African American Women|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/83b9f21g|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the blog ''Stop Street Harassment'' became a non-profit that is "dedicated to documenting and ending gender-based street harassment worldwide" by hosting events and keeping people informed about action they can take to end street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|title=About |publisher=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=2018-04-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
There is a high prevalence for street harassment to become sexual violence. Worldwide, statistics show that 80% of women endure at least frequent street harassment, 45% feel that they cannot go alone to public spaces, 50% have to cross the street to find alternate routes to their destinations, 26% claim that they are in a relationship in order to avoid harassment, 80% feel the need to be constantly alert when traversing local streets and 19% have had to switch careers to escape the area in which harassment occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meza-De-Luna|first1=M.|last2=García-Falconi|first2=S.|title=Adolescent Street Harassment in Querétaro, Mexico|journal=Affilia|date=2014|volume=30 |issue=2|pages=158–169|doi=10.1177/0886109914541117}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not only transnational, but also transcultural and affects people of all identities, races, and ages—everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennox|first1=R.|last2=Jurdi-Hage|first2=R.|title=Beyond the empirical and the discursive: The methodological implications of critical realism for street harassment research|journal=Womens Studies International Forum|volume=60|pages=23–28|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2016.11.010|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government sponsored a large survey in 1993 called the Violence Against Women Survey. In the sample of over 12,000 women, 85% said they were victims of harassment by a stranger.&lt;ref name="JRCD" /&gt; In a 2002 survey of [[Beijing]] residents, 58% cited public buses as a common location for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harassment rampant on public transportation|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Shanghai Star|date=11 April 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121955/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0411/cn8-4.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Australia shows that almost 90% of women have experienced verbal or physical harassment in public one or more times in their lives. In Afghanistan, research done in the same year indicates that the prevalence of harassment was 93%. Canadian and Egyptian studies show that the rate of incidence is approximately 85% of women experiencing street harassment in the past year. In U.S.-based research, it was reported that women experienced stranger harassment on a monthly basis (41%), while a large minority reported experiencing harassment once every few days (31%). These statistics are given to show a sense of the phenomenon as widely construed, not taken as representative of the same phenomenon comparable across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fileborn|first1=B|last2=Vera-Gray|first2=F|title='I Want to be Able to Walk the Street Without Fear': Transforming Justice for Street Harassment|journal=Feminist Legal Studies|volume=25 |issue=2|page=203|doi=10.1007/s10691-017-9350-3|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
A representative survey of 2,000 Americans was commissioned in 2014 by activist group Stop Street Harassment and conducted by [[GfK]]. 65% of women and 25% of men reported having been the victims of street harassment in their lives. 41% of women and 16% of men said they had been physically harassed in some way, such as by being followed, [[exhibitionism|flashed]], or groped.&lt;ref name="SSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsafe and Harassed in Public Spaces|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2014-National-SSH-Street-Harassment-Report.pdf|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014|date=Spring 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators are lone men in 70% of cases for female victims and 48% of cases for male victims; 20% of men who were harassed were the victims of a lone woman.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;  For men, the most common harassment was homophobic or transphobic slurs, followed by unwanted following, then catcalling and comments on body parts.  For women, the most common harassment was catcalling, followed by comments on body parts, unwanted touching or brushing up against, and then sexual slurs like "bitch" or "slut".&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

For women, most harassment is performed by a total stranger. This comes from a 1990s study from the American Midwest. It was found that numerous women have experienced street harassment on numerous occasions. Another 50% were physically harassed or followed by such strangers. Half of those surveyed revealed this harassment occurred by their 17th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=badf8f6d-512b-410d-a384-25507577cf5e%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=linus.b3207216&amp;db=cat00322a|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

66% of LGBT respondents in a 2012&lt;!-- note: the data relied upon in this report is from 2012, not 2014 --&gt; [[European Union]] survey said that they avoid [[holding hands]] in public for fear of harassment and assault. 50% said they avoid certain places or locations, and the places they listed as most unsafe to be open about their sexual orientations were "public transport" and "street, square, car parking lot, or other public space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU LGBT survey – European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey – Main results|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-eu-lgbt-survey-main-results_tk3113640enc_1.pdf|publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency]]|accessdate=31 October 2014|pages=87–89|format=pdf|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Stop Street Harassment national survey, LGBT men are 17% more likely to experience physically aggressive harassment and 20% more likely to encounter verbal harassment than heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/lgbt=men=experience=high=rates=of=street=harassment|title=LGBT Men Experience High Rates of Street Harassment|date=June 4, 2014|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|last=Miller|first=Hayley}}{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate survey, verbal harassment was cited as the most common form of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/.|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=American Progress|archive-url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|archive-date=19 July 2011|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were also a significant number of people who were harassed by being denied service or being physically harassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2011/07/19/9927/gay-and-transgender-discrimination-outside-the-workplace/|title=Gay and Transgender Discrimination Outside the Workplace|last=Burns|first=Crosby|date=19 July 2011|website=Center for American Progress|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample survey of 331 LGBTQ men in 2014 indicated the phenomena occurs worldwide. 90% of them claimed to be harassed in public spaces for their perceived differences. It was mainly their lack of traditionally masculine features that singled them out for abuse. This abuse was mainly aimed at how they did not fit typical gender roles while in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Stop Global Street Harassment|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=2015|website=Google Books|archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_tPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Kearl,+Holly.+Stop+Global+Street+Harassment:+Growing+Activism+around+the+World.+ABC-CLIO,+LLC,+2015.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qd9MCpzHfM&amp;sig=UkMwnWhOerK7yStLjbA6OEwlZ1E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbgdn02bPaAhUJslQKHbuSDfgQ6AEITTAL#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2015|dead-url=No|access-date=11 April 2018|isbn=9781440840210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health effects ===
A study in 2011 was aimed at recording the health effects of street harassment on women and girls. It was found that they were mentally stressed after experiencing street harassment. Poor mental health has been found to be linked to street harassment in addition to paranoia that certain spaces are not safe. The main way the women and girls put a stop to this was reducing the amount of time they spent on the street. However, this negatively impacted their ability to hold down a job or go to where they could receive healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=c3ba0215-5301-45f4-ab6b-d20f2035e2d3%40sessionmgr104|title=Experiences of street harassment and associations with perceptions of social cohesion among women in Mexico City|last=A Campos|first=Paola|date=1 January 2017|website=One Search|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 article, based on Canada's Violence Against Women Survey, showed that past exposure to harassment from strangers is an important factor in women's perceptions of their safety in public. Harassment from a stranger, as opposed to an acquaintance, is more likely to induce fear of sexual victimization.&lt;ref name="JRCD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macmillan|first1=Ross|last2=Nieorbisz|first2=Annette|last3=Welsh|first3=Sandy|title=Experiencing the Streets: Harassment and Perceptions of Safety among Women|journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency|date=1 August 2000|volume=37|issue=3|pages=306–322|doi=10.1177/0022427800037003003|url=http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/37/3/306.abstract|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 reported that "the experience of street harassment is directly related to a greater preoccupation with physical appearance and body shame, and is indirectly related to heightened fears of rape. ... Stranger harassment reduces feelings of safety while walking alone at night, using public transportation, walking alone in a parking garage, and while home alone at night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudoir|first1=Stephenie R.|last2=Quinn|first2=Diane M.|title=Bystander Sexism in the Intergroup Context: The Impact of Cat-calls on Women's Reactions Towards Men|journal=Sex Roles|date=3 March 2010|volume=62|issue=9|pages=623–634|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9735-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
In some cases, men may enjoy the thrill of doing something illegal or taboo, and some may experience sexual gratification from groping, flirting, or sexual humiliation.  Negative remarks can also be the result of [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]].{{citation_needed|reason=I realize this is considered common knowledge in feminist spaces, but someone should at least try to document it properly. Especially since the source cited in the following paragraph argues to the contrary.|date=August 2018}}

Australian reporter Eleanor Gordon-Smith recorded interactions in the 2010s in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales]], and found that men who catcalled women enjoyed getting attention, flirting, and the public performance. The men were also under the impression that the women who were the subject of their remarks and gestures enjoyed the attention and believed they were helping the women have a good time or were giving a compliment about physical appearance that would be appreciated. The vast majority of women in the area, in contrast, found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault. Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life"&gt;[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/603/once-more-with-feeling ''This American Life'' Episode 603: Once More, With Feeling Act One: Hollaback Girl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==
[[YouGov]] conducted a poll of about 1,000 Americans in August 2014. In their findings, 72% said it was never appropriate to make a "catcall", 18% said it was sometimes appropriate to catcall, and 2% said it was always acceptable. The majority (55%) labelled catcalling "harassment", while 20% called it "complimentary". Americans in the 18–29 age range were the most likely to categorize catcalling as complimentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Peter|title=Catcalling: Never OK and not a compliment|url=https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/08/15/catcalling/|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of women in the Kings Cross area study found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; In a more representative sample, a 2014 U.S. survey found that 68% of harassed women and 49% of harassed men were "very or somewhat concerned" the situation would escalate.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt; Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.&lt;ref name="this_life" /&gt; The U.S. survey found 31% of women responded by going out with other people instead of alone, and 4% of all victims made a major life change to avoid harassment, like moving or quitting a job.&lt;ref name="SSH" /&gt;

== Representation in media ==
The mainstream media, including any printed, televised, social media or other online information sources, commonly represent sexual and street harassment using overly simplified narratives and delegitimizing language. There exists a tendency in media portrayals of the issue that harassment occurs as a reflection of individual aberration, usually highlighting aspects of misconduct by one party against another.&lt;ref name="Women 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=Paula|last2=Charlesworth|first2=Sara|title=Framing Sexual Assault through Media Representations|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=March 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=95–103|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2012.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While humanities and feminist scholarship identify any degree of sexual harassment as a manifestation of gendered oppression and discrimination in society, seldom do mainstream media sources report that harassment derives from systemic gender inequality or introduce dialogue in the context of broader issues.&lt;ref name="Women 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Review 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easteal et. al,|first1=Paula|title=Review: Enduring Themes and Silences in Media Portrayals of Violence against Women|journal=Women Studies International Forum|date=January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|pages=103–113|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that mainstream media shapes the public opinion of harassment is by incorporating conservative messages to their audiences, specifically through the use of invalidating rhetoric. As with other forms of oppression against women, the language presented by media sources commonly undermines the validity of street harassment complaints.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt; The particular overuse of the words, "alleged," "supposed," "expected," immediately create a sense of uncertainty toward claims of harassment and assault, therefore imposing a sense of responsibility and/or guilt on to the victim.&lt;ref name="Review 2014" /&gt;

While the internet, social media specifically, allows a new platform for activism against street harassment, it has become a source of frequent verbal harassment against users. Harassment that victims may face in real life on the streets translates to the online public forum of Twitter. In a case study following a hashtag originating in November 2011, #mencallmethings, primarily female Twitter users posted and discussed examples of the harassment they received online from men.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Megarry|first1=Jessica|title=Online Incivility or Sexual Harassment? Conceptualizing Women's Experiences in the Digital Age|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=November 2014|volume=47|issue=1, part A|pages=46–55|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of this trending hashtag, tweets that were meant to educate, share stories, and create a sense of togetherness between victims often received backlash from the male Twitter user population, demonstrating that on an unmonitored media source women's voices on harassment are again silenced.&lt;ref name="Conceptualizing Women 2014" /&gt;

While internet "trolling" (defined as aggressive online behavior) is prevalent across several internet circles, the manifestation of gendered society which normalizes street harassment, result in a specific type of Internet aggression that feminist scholars label as "gendertrolling."&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantilla|first1=Karla|title=Gendertrolling: Misogyny Adapts to New Media|journal=Feminist Studies|date=20|issue=2013|page=53|url=electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsglr&amp;AN=edsgcl.350577349&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gendertrolling is thought to be a more threatening form of social media presence, one that aligns with the responses to the #mencallmethings posts. What allows gendertrolling to become destructive to its victims are the prescriptive signs of gender-based insults, hate speech, credible threats, unusual intensity, scope, longevity of attacks, and reaction to women speaking out, all which are similar features of street harassment.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com" /&gt;

==Activism==
Public activism against street harassment has grown since the late 2000s. A group called Stop Street Harassment began as a blog in 2008 and became incorporated as a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(3)|non-profit organization]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/|publisher=Stop Street Harassment|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides tips for dealing with street harassment in safe and assertive ways, as well as provide opportunities to "take community action". In 2010, Stop Street Harassment started the annual "International Anti-Street Harassment Week". During the third week in April, people from around the globe participated in "marches, rallies, workshops, and sidewalk chalkings" in an effort to gain attention for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/meetusonthestreet/|title=International Anti-Street Harassment Week|publisher=Stop Street Harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group called [[Hollaback!]] was founded in 2010.

Activists have made use of [[viral video]]s to publicize the frequency of unsolicited comments that women receive in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=Sarene|title=Jessica Williams Continues Her War Against Catcalls on 'The Daily Show'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/03/jessica-williams-continues-her-war-against-catcalls-on-the-daily-show/|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hajela |first1=Deepti |title=Viral Video Documents New York Street Harassment |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |date=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031005238/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/viral-video-documents-york-street-harassment-26568112 |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One American [[street art]]ist used [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for a campaign called "Stop Telling Women to Smile." The artist posts portraits of herself and other young women accompanied with messages against street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Felicia R.|title=An Artist Demands Civility on the Street With Grit and Buckets of Paste|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/arts/design/tatyana-fazlalizadeh-takes-her-public-art-project-to-georgia.html|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=New York Times|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Minneapolis]] woman created a set of printable "Cards Against Harassment" (in homage to the game ''[[Cards Against Humanity]]'') that she distributes to street harassers. The cards are meant to explain to street harassers why their comments are unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Estey|title=Cards Against Harassment address street harassers directly|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood/2014/0724/Cards-Against-Harassment-address-street-harassers-directly|accessdate=4 November 2014|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Cities Global Initiative created by UN-Habitat in 1996 is an approach to address harassment in public places through partnerships with cities’ communities, local organizations, and municipal governments. Actions taken to address this include improved street designs and lighting in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), a subcategory under UN Women, is committed to empowering women and advocating for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw|title=Commission on the Status of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Women|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, it included multiple clauses into their "[http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Agreed Conclusions]" that focused on sexual harassment in public places in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2013/05/2013-un-csw/|title=2013 UN Comission on the Status of Women|last=Kearl|first=Holly|date=28 May 2013|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study in ''The'' ''British Journal of Criminology'' examines the extent to which online sites serve as a form of informal justice for street harassment victims. The results show that individuals experience “validation” or “affirmation” after self-disclosing their experiences online and may receive acknowledgement or support by doing so. Notably, some individuals feel re-victimized or experience re-traumatization. It was found that online justice is limited, but in particular for street harassment, it is possible that victims achieve some form of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fileborn|first=Bianca|date=November 2017|title=Justice 2.0: Street harassment victims' use of social media and online activism as sites of informal justice|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/57/6/1482/2698882|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=57|pages=1482–1501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
In some jurisdiction there are laws that make some forms of street harassment illegal. Peru has had anti-street harassment laws since March 2015.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21651849-crackdown-public-displays-machismo-criminalising-catcallers|title=Criminalising the catcallers|work=The Economist|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quezon City]] in the [[Philippines]], which has a high rate of street harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Fritzie|title=The streets that haunt Filipino women|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/124993-sexual-harassment-women-streets|accessdate=June 2, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented an ordinance against street harassment, such as cat-calling and wolf-whistling, on May 16, 2016. Penalties for acts of street harassment include [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] of [[Philippine peso|Php]] 1,000 to Php 5,000 and a 1-month jail term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sauler|first1=Erika|title=In QC, wolf whistles can land you to jail|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/788539/in-qc-wolf-whistles-can-land-you-in-jail|accessdate=June 2, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the United States, laws regarding street harassment are under the jurisdiction of individual states. In Illinois there are laws that relate to street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KYR-Illinois.pdf|title=Illinois|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Street Harassment|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a potential precursor to physical assault and even murder, offensive speech and [[hate speech]] are protected under the [[First Amendment]]. Although a perpetrator is legally allowed to shout obscenities, other acts such as public indecency and sexual assault are blatant violations of the law. Offensive speech and hate speech as forms of street harassment are frequently used as evidence against repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Laura S.|date=2015-03-01|title=Street Harassment: Current and Promising Avenues for Researchers and Activists|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=3|pages=196–211|doi=10.1111/soc4.12248|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public's rejection of criminalizing offensive speech and hate speech in view of the First Amendment poses a challenge for the legal system. Contrary to popular belief, it is not just those who are unaffected by street harassment that hold this ideal; victims and survivors of offensive speech and hate speech are reluctant to advocate against this First Amendment right. Adversely, the public is hesitant to rely on the law in their daily lives as they prefer autonomy, regardless of how grave the situation may be.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Laura Beth|date=2000|title=Situating Legal Consciousness: Experiences and Attitudes of Ordinary Citizens about Law and Street Harassment|jstor=3115131|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1055–1090|doi=10.2307/3115131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is there a sense of powerlessness when being victimized during street harassment, but also during the legal process. More often than not, plaintiffs are unprepared for litigation and the courtroom as they are inexperienced, to no fault of their own. Quite frequently, plaintiffs are victims of legal aggression via their street harassment perpetrator. Perpetrators will file a frivolous lawsuit in response to their victim's charges. In addition to this, it is difficult to acquire government aid, as seen in the 1994 case when the EEOC received 11,000 harassment complaints and prosecuted fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stambaugh|first=Phoebe Morgan|date=1997|title=The Power of Law and the Sexual Harassment Complaints of Women|jstor=4316504|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=9|issue=2|pages=23–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of interviews conducted by Laura Beth Nielson in 2000, regarding the attitudes of the public in relation to the law and street harassment, four paradigms were offered. The freedom of speech paradigm is based on the ideal of allegiance to the First Amendment's supposed ideology. The autonomy paradigm is based on the desire for self-governance. The impracticality paradigm is based on the impossibility of regulation in regards to offensive speech and hate speech. Lastly, the distrust of authority paradigm is based on the lack of faith in legal officials to enforce laws. These four paradigms exemplify the reasoning behind the lack of criminalization for street harassment.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2000 1055–1090"/&gt;

The '''xartcollection''' was created in 1968 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] by [[Sandro Bocola]] and three partners: Heinz Bütler, Rolf Fehlbaum and Erwin Meierhofer.

Xartcollection’s concept was to industrially produce three-dimensional “Multiples” in limited and signed editions. The company’s philosophy was to make [[contemporary Art]] available to a large public and its “Multiples” where sold worldwide in art galleries, design- and furniture stores namely at “Wohnbedarf”[http://www.wohnbedarf.ch/] in Switzerland.

Internationally renowned artists such as [[Max Bill]], [[Getulio Alviani]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)]], [[Joe Tilson (artist)|Joe Tilson]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)]] and others participated in this project. Most of xartcollection's "Multiples" were produced by the firm of Reif, Relo-Kunststoffe in [[Lörrach]], [[Germany]]. 
In 1971 xartcollection also created "Xart Walls"[http://www.sandrobocola.com/eng/html/bio_layer.htm] which industrially produced [[wallpapers]] designed by known artists such as [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]]. The "Xart Walls" where manufactured by the firm "Marburg Wallcoverings" in [[Kirchhain]], Germany.

Despite its international reputation the company went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35142">The '''unconscious mind''' (or '''the unconscious''') consists of the processes in the [[mind]] which occur automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memories, interests, and motivations.&lt;ref name="Westen1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westen |first1=Drew |year=1999 |title=The Scientific Status of Unconscious Processes: Is Freud Really Dead? |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1061–1106 |doi=10.1177/000306519904700404 |url=http://apa.sagepub.com/content/47/4/1061 |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though these processes exist well under the surface of [[Conscious mind|conscious]] awareness they are theorized to exert an impact on behavior. The term was coined by the 18th-century German [[Romantic philosophy|Romantic philosopher]] [[Friedrich Schelling]] and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bynum |author2=Browne |author3=Porter |authorlink3=Roy Porter |title=The Macmillan Dictionary of the History of Science |location=London |year=1981 |page=292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004: {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}), pp. 1001–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical evidence suggests that unconscious phenomena include repressed feelings, automatic skills, subliminal perceptions, thoughts, habits, and automatic reactions,&lt;ref name="Westen1999" /&gt; and possibly also [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]], hidden phobias and desires.

The concept was popularized by the Austrian neurologist and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]. In [[psychoanalytic theory]], unconscious processes are understood to be directly represented in [[dream]]s, as well as in [[Freudian slip|slips of the tongue]] and [[joke]]s.

Thus the unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking).

It has been argued that [[consciousness]] is influenced by other parts of the [[mind]]. These include unconsciousness as a [[habit (psychology)|personal habit]], [[self-awareness|being unaware]], and [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]. Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include [[awake]]ning, [[implicit memory]], [[subliminal message]]s, [[trance]]s, [[hypnagogia]], and [[hypnosis]]. While [[sleep]], [[sleepwalking]], [[dream]]ing, [[delirium]], and [[coma]]s may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.

Some critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stannard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

==Historical overview==
The term "unconscious" ({{lang-de|Unbewusste}}) was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his ''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]'', [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Schelling,+Friedrich+Wilhelm+Joseph/System+des+transzendenten+Idealismus/6.+Hauptabschnitt.+Deduktion+eines+allgemeinen+Organs+der+Philosophie,+oder+Haupts%C3%A4tze+der+Philosophie+der+Kunst+nach+Grunds%C3%A4tzen+des+transzendentalen+Idealismus/%C2%A7+3.+Folges%C3%A4tze ch. 6, § 3]) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'').&lt;ref name=Macmillan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt; Some rare earlier instances of the term "unconsciousness" (''{{lang|De|Unbewußtseyn}}'') can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher [[Ernst Platner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Platner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4748AAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Unbewu%C3%9Ftseyn ''Philosophische Aphorismen nebst einigen Anleitungen zur philosophischen Geschichte''], Vol. 1 (Leipzig: Schwickertscher Verlag, 1793 [1776]), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angus Nicholls and Martin Liebscher, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Thinking_the_Unconscious.html?id=MCJzE-SxDUgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought''] (2010), Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influences on thinking that originate from outside of an individual's consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was also instigated in antiquity and has been explored across a wide variety of [[cross-cultural communication|cultures]]. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the [[Vedas]], found today in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. N. 1990.

[[Paracelsus]] is credited as the first to make mention of an unconscious aspect of cognition in his work ''Von den Krankheiten'' (translates as "About illnesses", 1567), and his clinical methodology created a cogent system that is regarded by some as the beginning of modern scientific psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, Ernest., ''Origins of Modern Psychiatry'', Thomas 1967 ASIN: B000NR852U, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] explored the role of the unconscious&lt;ref&gt;The Design Within: Psychoanalytic Approaches to Shakespeare: Edited by M.

He remarks on Schopenhauer's psychological doctrines several times, crediting him for example with recognizing parapraxes, and urges that Schopenhauer "was definitely among the ancestors of modern dynamic psychiatry." (1970, p. 205). He also cites with approval Foerster's interesting claim that "no one should deal with psychoanalysis before having thoroughly studied Schopenhauer." (1970, p. 542). In general, he views Schopenhauer as the first and most important of the many nineteenth-century philosophers of the unconscious, and concludes that "there cannot be the slightest doubt that Freud's thought echoes theirs." (1970, p. 542). }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;.Friedrich Nietzsche, preface to the second edition of "[[The Gay Science|The Gay science]]" 1886&lt;/ref&gt; used the word unconscious.

In 1880, Edmond Colsenet supports at the Sorbonne, a philosophy thesis on the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;"Un débat sur l'inconscient avant Freud: la réception de Eduard von Hartmann chez les psychologues et philosophes français". de Serge Nicolas et Laurent Fedi, L'Harmattan, 2008, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Elie Rabier and [[Alfred Fouillee]] perform syntheses of the unconscious "at a time when Freud was not interested in the concept".&lt;ref&gt;"Un débat sur l'inconscient avant Freud: la réception de Eduard von Hartmann chez les psychologues et philosophes français". de Serge Nicolas et Laurent Fedi, L'Harmattan, Paris, 2008, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

Psychologist Jacques Van Rillaer points out that, "the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, [[William James]], in his monumental treatise on psychology (''[[The Principles of Psychology]]''), examined the way [[Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|von Hartmann]], [[Pierre Janet|Janet]], [[Alfred Binet|Binet]] and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious'".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Catherine (edited by). ''Le livre noir de la psychanalyse: Vivre, penser et aller mieux sans Freud''. Paris: Les Arènes, 2005, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of psychology Mark Altschule observes that, "It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance."&lt;ref&gt;Altschule, Mark. ''Origins of Concepts in Human Behavior''. New York: Wiley, 1977, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Rilliaer could have also mentioned that [[Eduard von Hartmann]] published a book dedicated to this topic, ''Philosophy of the Unconscious,'' in 1869 -- long before anybody else.

Furthermore, 19th century German psychologists, [[Gustav Fechner]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]], had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an ''unconscious'' level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form."&lt;ref&gt;Wozniak, Robert H. ''Mind and Body: Rene Déscartes to William James''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Freud's view===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|right|240px|An iceberg is often (though misleadingly) used to provide a visual representation of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] theory that most of the human mind operates unconsciously.]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. It plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]].

Freud divided the mind into the conscious mind (or the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) and the unconscious mind. The latter was then further divided into the [[id, ego and superego|id]] (or [[instinct]]s and drive) and the [[superego]] (or [[conscience]]). In this theory, the unconscious refers to the mental processes of which individuals make themselves unaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geraskov, Emil Asenov |title=The internal contradiction and the unconscious sources of activity |journal=Journal of Psychology |date=November 1, 1994 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |quote=This article is an attempt to give new meaning to well-known experimental studies, analysis of which may allow us to discover unconscious behavior that has so far remained unnoticed by researchers. Those studies confirm many of the statements by Freud, but they also reveal new aspects of the unconscious psychic. The first global psychological concept of the internal contradiction as an unconscious factor influencing human behavior was developed by Sigmund Freud. In his opinion, this contradiction is expressed in the struggle between the biological instincts and the self. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190957/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud proposed a vertical and [[hierarchical]] architecture of human consciousness: the [[conscious mind]], the [[preconscious]], and the unconscious [[mind]]—each lying beneath the other. He believed that significant psychic events take place "below the surface" in the unconscious mind,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[dream]]ing: Freud called dream symbols the "royal road to the unconscious"&lt;/ref&gt; like hidden messages from the unconscious. He [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] such events as having both symbolic and actual significance.

In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what a person is averse to knowing consciously. Freud viewed the unconscious as a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]]. In a sense, this view places the conscious self as an adversary to its unconscious, warring to keep the unconscious hidden. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary [[introspection]], but are supposed to be capable of being "tapped" and "interpreted" by special methods and techniques such as meditation, [[free association (psychology)|free association]] (a method largely introduced by Freud), dream analysis, and [[speech communication|verbal]] slips (commonly known as a [[Freudian slip]]), examined and conducted during [[psychoanalysis]]. Seeing as these unconscious thoughts are normally cryptic, psychoanalysts are considered experts in interpreting their messages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freud based his concept of the unconscious on a variety of observations. For example, he considered "slips of the tongue" to be related to the unconscious in that they often appeared to show a person's true feelings on a subject. For example, "I decided to take a summer curse". This example shows a slip of the word "course" where the speaker accidentally used the word curse which would show that they have negative feelings about having to do this. Freud noticed that also his patient's dreams expressed important feelings they were unaware of. After these observations, he came to the conclusion that psychological disturbances are largely caused by personal conflicts existing at the unconscious level. His psychoanalytic theory acts to explain personality, motivation and mental disorders by focusing on unconscious determinants of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wnr7vEjB7NAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=After+these+observations,+he+came+to+the+conclusion+that+psychological+disturbances+are+largely+caused+by+personal+conflicts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NO9hC_TkTb&amp;sig=x-vc5BDhhYll9BZjtd-pCfqhmCo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zqjUdmeG-Kn4AT-9IC4CQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20these%20observations%2C%20he%20came%20to%20the%20conclusion%20that%20psychological%20disturbances%20are%20largely%20caused%20by%20personal%20conflicts&amp;f=false | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=6 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud later used his notion of the unconscious in order to explain certain kinds of [[neurosis|neurotic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jung, Carl|title=Man and His Symbols |date=1964 |quote=Sigmund Freud was the pioneer who first tried to explore empirically the unconscious background of consciousness. He worked on the general assumption that dreams are not a matter of chance but are associated with conscious thoughts and problems. This assumption was not in the least arbitrary. It was based upon the conclusion of eminent neurologists (for instance, Pierre Janet) that neurotic symptoms are related to some conscious experience. They even appear to be split-off areas of the conscious mind, which, at another time and under different conditions, can be conscious.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the unconscious was substantially transformed by later psychiatrists, among them [[Carl Jung]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].

In his 1932/1933 conferences, Freud "proposes to abandon the notion of the unconscious that ambiguous judge".&lt;ref&gt;'Une histoire des sciences humaines'', sous la direction de J.-F. Dortier, éditions Sciences humaines, 2006, {{ISBN|9782912601360}} - part : 1900-1950 "Le temps des fondations" ; chapter about Freud&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung's view===
{{Main|Carl Jung|Collective unconscious}}
Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss [[psychiatrist]], developed the concept further. He agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud's notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and [[archetypal]] experiences. Archetypes are not memories but images with universal meanings that are apparent in the culture's use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;"collective unconscious (psychology) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia." Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125572/collective-unconscious&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person shares the collective unconscious with the entire human species, as Jung puts it: [the] "whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (1971). Hero with a thousand faces. New York, NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;"Jung, Carl Gustav." The Columbia encyclopedia. 6th. ed. Columbia: Columbia University Press, 2000. 1490. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.

[[Franz Brentano]] rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]'', although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Vitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitz, Paul C. |title=Sigmund Freud's Christian Unconscious |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=59-62;107ff |isbn=0-89862-673-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] offers a critique of Freud's theory of the unconscious in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] argues that Sartre's argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] contends that, "The term 'the unconscious' is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as ''the'' unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, ''of which we are unconscious''. If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. ''Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx &amp; Freud''. London: Sphere Books, 1980, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]] has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as 'repressed consciousness,' while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of "thoughts" that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are ''in principle never accessible'' to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not "nonconscious" processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a "thought" in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, "think" it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of "something" as a "thought" either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. ''The Rediscovery of the Mind''. MIT Press, 1994, pp. 151-173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the Freudian unconscious include [[David Stannard]],&lt;ref name="Stannard"&gt;See "The Problem of Logic", Chapter 3 of ''Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'', published by Oxford University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]],&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;See "Exploring the Unconscious: Self-Analysis and Oedipus", Chapter 11 of ''Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis'', published by The Orwell Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Watters]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See "A Profession in Crisis", Chapter 1 of ''Therapy's Delusions: The Myth of the Unconscious and the Exploitation of Today's Walking Worried'', published by Scribner, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ofshe]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Eric Thomas Weber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber ET | year = 2012 | title = James's Critiques of the Freudian Unconscious – 25 Years Earlier | url = http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | format = PDF | journal = William James Studies | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 94–119 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003719/http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the lack of evidence for many Freudian hypotheses, some scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones.

In modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as "implicit" or "automatic" have come into currency. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, Draine SC, Abrams RL |title=Three cognitive markers of unconscious semantic activation |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5282 |pages=1699–702 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8781230 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/273/5282/1699.long |doi=10.1126/science.273.5282.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaillard R, Del Cul A, Naccache L, Vinckier F, Cohen L, Dehaene S |title=Nonconscious semantic processing of emotional words modulates conscious access |journal=Proc.

==Dreams==

===Freud===
In terms of the unconscious, the purpose of dreams, as stated by [[Freud]], is to fulfill repressed wishes through the process of dreaming, since they cannot be fulfilled in real life. For example, if someone were to rob a store and to feel guilty about it, they might dream about a scenario in which their actions were justified and renders them blameless. Freud asserted that the wish-fulfilling aspect of the dream may be disguised due to the difficulty in distinguishing between manifest content and latent content. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|manifest content]] consists of the plot of a dream at the surface level. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|latent content]] refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events in the plot. The latent content of the dream is what supports the idea of wish fulfillment. It represents the intimate information in the dreamer's current issues and childhood conflict.&lt;ref name=Weiten166&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=166–167 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing theories===
In response to Freud's theory on dreams, other psychologists have come up with theories to counter his argument. Theorist Rosalind Cartwright proposed that dreams provide people with the opportunity to act out and work through everyday problems and emotional issues in a non-real setting with no consequences. According to her [[cognitive]] problem solving view, a large amount of continuity exists between our waking thought and the thoughts that exist in dreams. Proponents of this view believe that dreams allow participation in creative thinking and alternate ways to handle situations when dealing with personal issues because dreams are not restrained by logic or realism.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

In addition to this, [[Allan Hobson]] and colleagues came up with the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces [[beta brain wave]]s during [[REM sleep]] that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

==Contemporary cognitive psychology==

===Research===
While, historically, the psychoanalytic research tradition was the first to focus on the phenomenon of unconscious mental activity, there is an extensive body of conclusive research and knowledge in contemporary [[cognitive psychology]] devoted to the mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness.

Most of that (cognitive) research on unconscious processes has been done in the mainstream, academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. As opposed to the psychoanalytic tradition, driven by the relatively speculative (in the sense of being hard to empirically verify) theoretical concepts such as the [[Oedipus complex]] or [[Electra complex]], the cognitive tradition of research on unconscious processes is based on relatively few theoretical assumptions and is very empirically oriented (i.e., it is mostly data driven). Cognitive research has revealed that automatically, and clearly outside of conscious awareness, individuals register and acquire more information than what they can experience through their conscious thoughts. (See Augusto, 2010, for a recent comprehensive survey.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Augusto, L.M. |title=Unconscious knowledge: A survey |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=116–141 |year=2010 |url=http://www.ac-psych.org/?id=2&amp;rok=2010 |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious processing of information about frequency===
For example, an extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasher L, Zacks RT |title=Automatic processing of fundamental information: the case of frequency of occurrence |journal=Am Psychol |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1372–88 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6395744 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.12.1372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (i.e., outside of conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly "automatically," regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age,&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;Connolly, Deborah Ann (1993). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/636/ A developmental evaluation of frequency information in lists, scripts, and stories]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; education, intelligence, or personality, thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of [[procedural knowledge]] and experience, in general.

[[Image:WaterYam.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Water Yam'', First Edition, 1963]]
'''''Water Yam''''' is an [[artist's book]]&lt;ref&gt;'As a book, Water Yam has a very open structure....' The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary 2004, p311&lt;/ref&gt; by the American artist [[George Brecht]]. Originally published in Germany, June 1963&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams 1989, p216&lt;/ref&gt; in a box designed by [[George Maciunas]] and typeset by [[Tomas Schmit]], it has been re-published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online"&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html Dada and Radical Art Online]&lt;/ref&gt; the internationalist [[avant-garde]] art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a ''Fluxbox'' or ''Fluxkit'', contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as ''[[Event score|event-score]]s'', or ''fluxscores''. Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and perception. Or, in the words of the artist, “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.” The event-score was as much a critique of conventional artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against individual alienation.&lt;ref name="Dada and Radical Art Online" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work is considered an important precursor to [[conceptual art]].

==The scores==
[[Image:ThreeLampEvents.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Three Lamp Event'', part of ''Lantern Extract'', a mail art project within the ''Yam Festival'', 1962,]]
Early editions of ''Water Yam'' collected around 70 event-scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book ''Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie'', and [[white-on-black]] invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'.

Many of the scores had been used in [[mail art]] events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or [[hectograph]]ed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on [[Bullet (typography)|bullet points]] (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes.

The scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as ''Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass'' • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as ''Chair Event'' • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as ''Thursday'' • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous ''Drip Music''; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as ''Keyhole'' •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card.

==Origins of event-scores==
{{See also|Fluxus#Event score}}

===John Cage and the experimental composition classes===
Brecht met the artist [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in 1957, and through Watts, [[Allan Kaprow]]. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of [[Howard Johnson's]], New Jersey. After a meeting with [[John Cage]] organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms,&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow, quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt; the three men started to attend Cage's experimental music composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation.... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg." Allan Kaprow&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kaprow in conversation with Sidney Simon, early 70's. Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest [[Happening]]s, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd "never felt so controlled before."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764245/pg_2 Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois]&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Brecht  to pare the scores down to [[haiku]]-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed.

As well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] theories on art, which he'd written about at length in ''Chance-Imagery'', a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the [[Something Else Press]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the "event" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have said, to "make it strange" and "de-automatize our perception."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 ''Toward Events: An Arrangement'' clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience....works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p34&lt;/ref&gt; The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an epiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the Spring of 1960 ... waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a truly 'event' piece could be drawn from the situation." George Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht, The Origin of Events, 1970 Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p236&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival, 1963===
''Yam'' was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.'&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68"&gt;George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p68&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest ''Yam'' events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and [[George Segal|George Segal's]] farm. 
The ''Yam Festival'' was held on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey on 19 May 1963 to actions and happenings by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Wolf Vostell]].
The festival was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom. [[Wolf Vostell]] made here his happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/ ''Yam Festival'', 1963, Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In all of its formats and strategies Brecht's and Watt's ''Yam Festival'' operated as an alternative to the gallery system, producing "art" that could not be bought." Julia Robinson&lt;ref name="George Brecht Events p68" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Artists participating in the festival included [[Alison Knowles]], Allan Kaprow, [[John Cage]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ay-O]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Ray Johnson]]. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. ''Yam'' evolved parallel to George Maciunas' ''Fluxfests'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Oxford Art Online, Fluxus essay by Michael Corris, Subscription Only]&lt;/ref&gt; set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music (''Festum Fluxorum''), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, [[Raoul Hausmann]] and [[Nam June Paik]]. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous ''Drip Event'', were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Emmett Williams]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

===Maciunas in Germany===
[[Image:DripPiece-Maciunas.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Brecht's ''Drip Music'', performed by George Maciunas, Amsterdam, 1963]]
Clearly aware of the ''Yam Festival'', Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|US army]] stationed at [[Eppstein#Ehlhalten|Ehlhalten]] near [[Wiesbaden]],&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Schmitt, Maciunas' assistant in 1963 quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p276&lt;/ref&gt; and placed them in a box with a fine example of his [[graphic design]] pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works'&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day.The use of multiple [[font]]s derived from his interest in experimental [[typography]] by [[Dada]] figures such as [[Hugo Ball]] and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. 

Published in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first ''Fluxkit'', and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's ''Yam Festival'', and Maciunas' ''FluxFests''.

==Later versions==
It has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English ''Parrot Impressions'', 1972, or the ''Lebeer Hossmann'' edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word ''Fluxus'' anywhere in or on the work. Ironically, for an object conceived as an "inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited edition (designed) to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist’s ego."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028714?q=fluxus&amp;hbutton_search.x=0&amp;hbutton_search.y=0&amp;hbutton_search=search&amp;source=oao_gao&amp;source=oao_t118&amp;source=oao_t234&amp;source=oao_t4&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit Fluxus]". Grove Art Online, subscription only.&lt;/ref&gt; and originally sold for $4,&lt;ref&gt;Price listed in the Fluxus Preview Review, July 1963, quoted in the Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; early copies are now worth in excess of $1800.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findartinfo.com/search/listprices.asp?keyword=137847&lt;/ref&gt;
