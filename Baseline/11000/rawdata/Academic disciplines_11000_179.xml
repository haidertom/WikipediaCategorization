      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">[[File:Sound-transmission.png|300px|thumb|Example of airborne and structure-borne transmission of sound, where Lp is sound pressure level, A is attenuation, P is acoustical pressure, S is the area of the wall [m²], and τ is the transmission coefficient]]
'''Acoustic transmission''' is the transmission of sounds through and between materials, including air, wall, and musical instruments.

The degree to which sound is transferred between two materials depends on how well their [[acoustical impedance]]s match. 

==In musical instrument design==
[[Musical instrument]]s are generally designed to radiate sound effectively. A high-impedance part of the instrument, such as a string, transmits vibrations through a bridge (intermediate impedance) to a sound board (lower impedance). The soundboard then moves the still lower-impedance air. Without bridge and soundboard, the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air, and is too quiet to be performed with. An electric guitar has no soundboard; it uses a microphone pick-up and artificial amplification. Without amplification, electric guitars are very quiet.

==Stethoscope==
[[Stethoscope]]s roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body, so they transmit sounds from a patient's chest to the doctor's ear much more effectively than the air does. Putting an ear to someone's chest would have a similar effect.

==In building design==
Acoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another. Typically these are:
#Airborne transmission - a noise source in one room sends air pressure waves which induce vibration to one side of a wall or element of structure setting it moving such that the other face of the wall vibrates in an adjacent room. [[Structural isolation]] therefore becomes an important consideration in the [[Soundproofing|acoustic design]] of buildings. Highly sensitive areas of buildings, for example recording studios, may be almost entirely isolated from the rest of a structure by constructing the studios as effective boxes supported by springs. Air tightness also becomes an important control technique. A tightly sealed door might have reasonable sound reduction properties, but if it is left open only a few millimeters its effectiveness is reduced to practically nothing. The most important acoustic control method is adding mass into the structure, such as a heavy dividing wall, which will usually reduce airborne sound transmission better than a light one.
#Impact transmission - a noise source in one room results from an impact of an object onto a separating surface, such as a floor and transmits the sound to an adjacent room. A typical example would be the sound of footsteps in a room being heard in a room below. Acoustic control measures usually include attempts to isolate the source of the impact, or cushioning it. For example carpets will perform significantly better than hard floors.
#Flanking transmission - a more complex form of noise transmission, where the resultant vibrations from a noise source are transmitted to other rooms of the building usually by elements of structure within the building. For example, in a steel framed building, once the frame itself is set into motion the effective transmission can be pronounced.

'''Bark''' is the outermost layers of [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[root]]s of [[woody plant]]s.  Plants with bark include [[tree]]s, woody [[vine]]s, and [[shrub]]s. Bark refers to all the tissues outside the [[vascular cambium]] and is a nontechnical term.&lt;ref name=Raven1981&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray F. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Helena | year = 1981 | title = Biology of Plants | page = 641 | isbn = 0-87901-132-7 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, N.Y. | oclc = 222047616}}&lt;/ref&gt; It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older [[Plant stem|stem]]s is living tissue, includes the innermost area of the '''periderm'''. The outer bark in older stems includes the dead tissue on the surface of the stems, along with parts of the innermost periderm and all the tissues on the outer side of the periderm. The outer bark on trees which lies external to the last formed periderm is also called the '''rhytidome'''.

Products derived from bark include: bark shingle siding and wall coverings, spices and other flavorings, [[tanbark]] for tannin, [[resin]], [[latex]], medicines, poisons, various [[hallucinogen]]ic chemicals and [[Cork (material)|cork]]. Bark has been used to make cloth, canoes, and ropes and used as a surface for paintings and map making.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Luke. 1996. ''Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land. Oxford Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plants are also grown for their attractive or interesting bark colorations and surface textures or their bark is used as landscape [[mulch]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandved, Kjell Bloch, Ghillean T. Prance, and Anne E. Prance. 1993. ''Bark: the Formation, Characteristics, and Uses of Bark around the World''. Portland, Or: Timber Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaucher, Hugues, and James E. Eckenwalder. 2003. ''Tree Bark: a Color Guide''. Portland: Timber&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanic description==
What is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues.  Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the [[cork cambium]] which is a layer of [[meristem]]atically active [[cell (biology)|cells]] which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium. Together, the phellem (cork), phellogen (cork cambium) and phelloderm constitute the periderm.&lt;ref name="Dickison, WC 2000"&gt;Dickison, WC. 2000. Integrative Plant Anatomy, Academic Press, San Diego, 186–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork cell walls contain [[suberin]], a waxy substance which protects the stem against water loss, the invasion of insects into the stem, and prevents infections by bacteria and fungal spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.puc.edu/Faculty/Gilbert_Muth/botglosp.htm |title=Botany Glossary "P" |publisher=.puc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the [[vascular cambium]], are the only parts of a woody stem where [[cell division]] occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary [[xylem]] to the inside and secondary [[phloem]] to the outside. Phloem is a [[nutrient]]-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with [[parenchyma]] and fibers. The [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] is the primary tissue of [[Plant stem|stem]]s and roots. In stems the cortex is between the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] layer and the phloem, in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the [[pericycle]].

[[File:Tree secondary components diagram.png|thumb|500px|right|Tree cross section diagram]]
From the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem, the layers include:&lt;ref name=Pereira2007&gt;{{Citation | last = Pereira | first =  Helena | year = 2007 | title = Cork | page = 8 | isbn = 0-444-52967-5 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | oclc = 162131397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pine bark tecpan guatemala.JPG|thumb|Bark of a pine tree in [[Tecpán Guatemala|Tecpán]], Guatemala.]]

In young stems, which lack what is commonly called bark, the tissues are, from the outside to the inside:

# [[Epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]], which may be replaced by periderm
# Cortex
# Primary and secondary phloem
# Vascular cambium
# Secondary and primary xylem.

As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world.  In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork.  Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients.  This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and other stems.

==Periderm==
Often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which is composed of cork (phellem), the [[cork cambium]] (phellogen), and the phelloderm. The periderm forms from the phellogen which serves as a lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have [[suberin]] in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, as is the case with woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Artschwager | first1 = E | year = 1924 | title = Studies on the potato tuber | url = | journal = J. Agr. Res. | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 809–835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Barker | first2 = W.G. | year = 1979 | title = Early tuber development from explanted stolon nodes of Solanum tuberosum var. Kennebec | url = | journal = Bot. Gaz. | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 398–406 | doi=10.1086/337104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In woody plants the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year. As the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis, called the cork cambium, these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork. A limited number of cell layers may form interior to the cork cambium, called the phelloderm.
As the stem grows, the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm, namely the epidermis, cortex and older secondary phloem die.&lt;ref name=Mauseth2003&gt;{{citation| last = Mauseth | first =  James D.| year = 2003| title = Botany: an Introduction to Plant Biology| ISBN=0-7637-2134-4| page = 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the periderm are [[lenticel]]s, which form during the production of the first periderm layer.  Since there are living cells within the cambium layers that need to exchange gases during metabolism, these lenticels, because they have numerous intercellular spaces, allow gaseous exchange with the outside atmosphere. As the bark develops, new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers.

==Rhytidome==
[[File:BarkAndWire-0308.jpg|thumb|right|Living tree bark enveloping [[barbed wire]]]]
The rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark, being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees. It is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of [[suberin|suberized]] periderm, cortical and phloem tissue.&lt;ref name="Dickison, WC 2000"/&gt; The rhytidome is especially well developed in older stems and roots of trees. In shrubs, older bark is quickly [[Exfoliation (botany)|exfoliated]] and thick rhytidome accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=185 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thickest and most distinctive at the trunk or [[Trunk (botany)|bole]] (the area from the ground to where the main branching starts) of the tree.

==Chemical composition==
Bark tissues make up by weight between 10–20% of woody vascular plants and consists of various [[biopolymer]]s, [[tannin]]s, [[lignin]], [[suberin]], suberan and [[polysaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name="bark decay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vane | first1 = C. H. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2006 | title = Bark decay by the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes: Polysaccharide loss, lignin resistance and the unmasking of suberin | url = | journal = International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 14–23 | doi=10.1016/j.ibiod.2005.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of the bark tissue is made of lignin which forms an important part of a plant providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides, such as cellulose.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;

Condensed [[tannin]], which are in fairly high concentration in bark tissue, is thought to inhibit decomposition.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt; It could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood. 
It has been proposed that, in the cork layer (the phellogen), suberin acts as a barrier to microbial degradation and so protects the internal structure of the plant.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolattukudy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kolattukudy | first1 = P.E. | year = 1984 | title = Biochemistry and function of cutin and suberin | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Botany | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 2918–2933 | doi=10.1139/b84-391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the [[lignin]] in bark wall during decay by the white-rot fungi ''Lentinula edodes'' ([[Shiitake mushroom]]) using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR revealed that the lignin polymers contained more Guaiacyl [[lignin]] units than Syringyl units compared to the interior of the plant.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt; Guaiacyl units are less susceptible to degradation as, compared to syringyl, they contain fewer aryl-aryl bonds, can form a condensed lignin structure and have a lower [[redox potential]].&lt;ref name="Degradation of lignin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vane | first1 = C.

Cork, sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech, is the outermost layer of a woody stem, derived from the [[cork cambium]]. It serves as protection against damage from [[parasite]]s, [[Herbivory|herbivorous]] animals and diseases, as well as dehydration and fire. Cork can contain [[antiseptic]]s like [[tannin]]s, that protect against fungal and bacterial attacks that would cause [[Decomposition|decay]].

[[File:Detaching inner bark of pine.jpg|right|thumb|Bark of [[pine]] was used as emergency food in Finland during [[famine]], last time during and after [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] in 1918.]]

In some plants, the bark is substantially thicker, providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges. In the cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]'') the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a [[cork (material)|cork product]] without killing the tree;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Aronson J. |editor2=Pereira J.S. |editor3=Pausas J.G. |year= 2009 |title=Cork Oak Woodlands on the Edge: conservation, adaptive management, and restoration |publisher=Island Press |location= Washington DC |url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/corkoak.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this species the bark may get very thick (e.g. more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm has been reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paulo Fernandes |url=http://jgpausas.blogs.uv.es/2011/01/03/bark-thickness/ |title=j.g. pausas' blog " Bark thickness: a world record? |doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.010 |publisher=Jgpausas.blogs.uv.es |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some barks can be removed in long sheets; the smooth surfaced bark of [[birch]] trees has been used as a covering in the making of canoes, as the drainage layer in roofs, for shoes, backpacks etc. The most famous example of using birch bark for canoes is the birch canoes of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Adney, Tappan, and Howard Irving Chapelle. 1964.'' The Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner bark ([[phloem]]) of some trees is edible; in Scandinavia, [[bark bread]] is made from [[rye]] to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of [[scots pine]] or [[birch]] is added. The [[Sami people|Sami]] people of far northern Europe used large sheets of ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'' bark that were removed in the spring, prepared and stored for use as a staple food resource and the inner bark was eaten fresh, dried or roasted.&lt;ref name=Zackrisson200&gt;{{citation | last1 = Zackrisson | first1 = O. | last2 = Östlund | first2 = L. | last3 = Korhonen | first3 = O. | last4 = Bergman | first4 = I. | year = 200 | title = The ancient use of Pinus sylvestris L.

=== Mechanical bark processing ===
Bark contains strong fibres known as [[bast fibre|bast]], and there is a long tradition in northern Europe of using bark from [[coppice]]d young branches of the small-leaved lime (''[[Tilia cordata]]'') to produce [[Rope|cordage]] and [[rope]], used for example in the [[rigging]] of [[Viking age]] [[longship]]s.&lt;ref name=Myking&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myking | first1 = T. | last2 = Hertzberg | first2 = A. | last3 = Skrøppa | first3 = T. | year = 2005 | title = History, manufacture and properties of lime bast cordage in northern Europe | url = | journal = Forestry | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 65–71 | doi = 10.1093/forestry/cpi006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the commercial products made from bark are [[cork (material)|cork]], [[cinnamon]], [[quinine]]&lt;ref&gt;Duran-Reynals, Marie Louise de Ayala. 1946. ''The Fever Bark Tree; the Pageant of Quinine''. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; (from the bark of [[Cinchona]])&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Clements R. 1880. ''Peruvian Bark. A Popular Account of the Introduction of Chinchona Cultivation into British India''. London: J. Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aspirin]] (from the bark of [[willow]] trees). The bark of some trees notably oak (''Quercus robur'') is a source of [[tannic acid]], which is used in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. Bark chips generated as a [[by-product]] of [[lumber]] production are often used in bark [[mulch]] in western North America. Bark is important to the horticultural industry since in shredded form it is used for plants that do not thrive in ordinary soil, such as [[epiphyte]]s.

=== Bark chip extraction ===
;Wood Adhesives from Bark-Derived Phenols: Wood Bark has [[lignin]] content and when it is pyrolyzed (subjected to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen), it yields a liquid [[bio-oil]] product rich in [[natural phenol]] derivatives. The phenol derivatives are isolated and recovered for application as a replacement for fossil-based phenols in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins used in [[Oriented Strand Board]] (OSB) and plywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/fy04/wood_adhesives.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411073832/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/fy04/wood_adhesives.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bark removal==
Cut logs are inflamed either just before cutting or before curing.  Such logs and even trunks and branches found in their natural state of decay in forests, where the bark has fallen off, are said to be decorticated.

A number of living organisms live in or on bark, including insects,&lt;ref&gt;Lieutier, François. 2004. ''Bark and Wood Boring Insects in Living Trees in Europe, a Synthesis''. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; fungi and other plants like mosses, algae and other vascular plants. Many of these organisms are pathogens or parasites but some also have symbiotic relationships.

== Bark repair ==

The degree to which trees are able to repair gross physical damage to their bark is very variable. Some are able to produce a callus growth which heals over the wound rapidly, but leaves a clear scar, whilst others such as oaks do not produce an extensive callus repair. [[Frost crack]] and [[Sun scald (flora)|sun scald]] are examples of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree, depending on the severity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">The '''Basin Focal Projects''' (BFPs) are a set of ''[[CGIAR]] Challenge Program on Water and Food'' projects aimed at identifying and catalyzing the implementation of strategic interventions to enhance human and ecological well-being through increases in [[river basin]] and local level water productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waterandfood.org/ |title=CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food website |access-date=2018-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627163014/https://waterandfood.org/ |archive-date=2018-06-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpwfbfp.pbworks.com Basin Focal Projects Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Projects provide strategic research that links project and basin activities with the global demand for improved agricultural water productivity. They do this by analyzing conditions in ten river basins under six work packages.

*Phase I projects commissioned in 2005 include basins of the [[Mekong]], [[Karkheh]], [[Volta River|Volta]] and the [[Sao Francisco]].These four projects have reached completion. They produced valuable insights about the specific nature of the food and water crisis in basins.
*Phase II projects commissioned in 2008 include basins of [[Indus|Indo]]-[[Ganges]], [[Andes|Andean]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfpandes.org Andean Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt; system of basins, [[Nile]], [[Niger]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfpniger.eu Niger Project Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326142147/http://www.bfpniger.eu/ |date=March 26, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow River]] and the [[Limpopo]] and run through 2009.

Research projects are led by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]], Australia (CSIRO), [[University of California, Davis]] (UC-Davis), [[Institut de recherche pour le développement]] (IRD), [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), Agricultural Research Council of South Africa (ARC) and are supported by FANRPAN,  [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and [[King's College London]] (KCL).

==Methodology==

BFP analyses are grouped into six work packages: 
*water poverty,
*water availability,
*water productivity,
*institutional analysis,
*intervention analysis and
*knowledge management.

Problems of water, food and poverty are explored by asking the following kinds of questions:

*To what extent is water scarce?
*To what extent is [[water scarcity]] and access a cause of poverty?
*Who gets access to water and who does not?
*How are such decisions made?
*How efficiently is water used?
*How can it be used more efficiently?
*How can water related interventions (policy changes, institutional innovations, new technologies) help improve food security, livelihood resilience and ecosystem services?
*What are the consequences (for different water users and uses at different scales) of introducing different kinds of changes?

'''Byzantine fault tolerance''' ('''BFT''') is the dependability of a [[fault-tolerant computer system]], particularly [[distributed computing]] systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. In a "Byzantine failure", a component such as a [[Server (computing)|server]] can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. 

It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]] regarding which component has failed in the first place. The term is derived from the [[#Byzantine Generals' Problem|Byzantine Generals' Problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 382&amp;ndash;401 | year = 1982 | url = https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf | dead-url = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180613015025/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf | archivedate = 13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable. Byzantine fault tolerance has been also referred to with the phrases '''interactive consistency''' or '''source congruency''', '''error avalanche''', '''Byzantine agreement problem''', '''Byzantine generals problem''', and '''Byzantine failure'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lamspeople.epfl.ch/kirrmann/Pubs/FaultTolerance/Fault_Tolerance_Tutorial_HK.pdf#page=94

==Background==
A Byzantine fault is any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Driscoll| first1=K.| last2=Hall| first2=B.| last3=Paulitsch| first3=M.| last4=Zumsteg| first4=P. |last5=Sivencrona| first5=H.| title=The Real Byzantine Generals| year=2004| pages=6.D.4–61-11| doi=10.1109/DASC.2004.1390734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Byzantine failure is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]].&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Driscoll| first1=Kevin| last2=Hall| first2=Brendan| last3=Sivencrona| first3=Håkan| last4=Zumsteg| first4=Phil
| title=Byzantine Fault Tolerance, from Theory to Reality| volume=2788| year=2003| pages=235–248| issn=0302-9743| doi=10.1007/978-3-540-39878-3_19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of Byzantine fault tolerance is to be able to defend against failures of system components with or without symptoms that prevent other components of the system from reaching an agreement among themselves, where such an agreement is needed for the correct operation of the system.

Remaining correctly operational components of a Byzantine fault tolerant system will be able to continue providing the system's service as originally intended, assuming there are sufficiently many accurately operating components to maintain the service.

Byzantine failures are considered the most general and most difficult class of failures among the [[Failure cause|failure modes]]. The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas fail-stop failure mode simply means that the only way to fail is a [[Node (computer science)|node]] crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions, which means that the failed node can generate arbitrary data, pretending to be a correct one. Thus, Byzantine failures can confuse failure detection systems, which makes fault tolerance difficult. Despite the analogy, a Byzantine failure is not necessarily a [[security]] problem involving hostile human interference: it can arise purely from electrical faults.

The terms fault and failure are used here according to the standard definitions&lt;ref name="AvizienisLaprie2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Avizienis
| first1=A.| last2=Laprie| first2=J.-C.| last3=Randell| first3=Brian| author-link3=Brian Randell| last4=Landwehr| first4=C.| title=Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing| journal=IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing| volume=1| issue=1| year=2004| pages=11–33| issn=1545-5971
| doi=10.1109/TDSC.2004.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally created by a joint committee on "Fundamental Concepts and Terminology" formed by the [[IEEE]] Computer Society's Technical Committee on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance and [[IFIP]] Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance| url = http://www.dependability.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of these definitions is also described in the [[Dependability]] Wikipedia page.

==Byzantine Generals' Problem==
''Byzantine'' refers to the Byzantine Generals' Problem, an agreement problem (described by [[Leslie Lamport]], Robert Shostak and Marshall Pease in their 1982 paper, "The Byzantine Generals Problem")&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper /&gt; in which a group of generals, each commanding a portion of the [[Byzantine army]], encircle a city.  These generals wish to formulate a plan for attacking the city.  In its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat.  Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat.  The important thing is that every general agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a [[rout]], and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

The problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively.  For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest.  Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers).  The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.

Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the loyal (non-faulty) generals have a majority agreement on their strategy.  There can be a default vote value given to missing messages.  For example, missing messages can be given the value &amp;lt;Null&amp;gt;.  Further, if the agreement is that the &amp;lt;Null&amp;gt; votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat).&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamport | first1 = L. | authorlink1 = Leslie Lamport| last2 = Shostak | first2 = R. | last3 = Pease | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/357172.357176 | title = The Byzantine Generals Problem | journal = ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 387&amp;ndash;389 | year=1982 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104645/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf | archivedate = 7 February 2017 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical mapping of this story onto computer systems is that the computers are the generals and their digital communication system links are the messengers. Although the problem is formulated in the analogy as a decision-making and security problem, in electronics, it cannot be solved simply by [[cryptographic]] [[digital signature]]s, because failures such as incorrect voltages can propagate through the encryption process. Thus, a component may appear functioning to one component and faulty to another, which prevents forming a consensus whether the component is faulty or not.

==Examples of Byzantine failures==
Several examples of Byzantine failures that have occurred are given in two equivalent journal papers.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003" /&gt; These and other examples are described on the [[NASA]] DASHlink web pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These web pages also describe some phenomenology that can cause Byzantine faults.

Byzantine errors were observed infrequently and at irregular points during endurance testing for the newly constructed [[Virginia-class submarine|''Virginia'' class submarines]], at least through 2005 (when the issues were publicly reported).&lt;ref name="WalterEllis2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walter|first1=C.|last2=Ellis|first2=P.|last3=LaValley|first3=B.|title=The Reliable Platform Service: A Property-Based Fault Tolerant Service Architecture|year=2005|pages=34–43|doi=10.1109/HASE.2005.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem faces honeybee swarms. They have to find a new home, and the many scouts and wider participants have to reach consensus about which of perhaps several candidate homes to fly to. And then they all have to fly there, with their queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/587249075|title=Honeybee democracy|last=D.|first=Seeley, Thomas|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691147215|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=587249075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early solutions==
Several solutions were described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in 1982.&lt;ref name=BGP_Paper/&gt; They began by noting that the Generals' Problem can be reduced to solving a "Commander and Lieutenants" problem where loyal Lieutenants must all act in unison and that their action must correspond to what the Commander ordered in the case that the Commander is loyal.
* One solution considers scenarios in which messages may be forged, but which will be ''Byzantine-fault-tolerant'' as long as the number of traitorous generals does not equal or exceed one third of the generals. The impossibility of dealing with one-third or more traitors ultimately reduces to proving that the one Commander and two Lieutenants problem cannot be solved, if the Commander is traitorous. To see this, suppose we have a traitorous Commander A, and two Lieutenants, B and C:  when A tells B to attack and C to retreat, and B and C send messages to each other, forwarding A's message, neither B nor C can figure out who is the traitor, since it is not necessarily A—another Lieutenant could have forged the message purportedly from A. It can be shown that if ''n'' is the number of generals in total, and ''t'' is the number of traitors in that ''n'', then there are solutions to the problem only when ''n'' &amp;gt; 3''t'' and the communication is synchronous (bounded delay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* A second solution requires unforgeable message signatures.  For [[Critical system#Security critical|security-critical systems]], [[digital signature]]s (in modern computer systems, this may be achieved in practice using [[public-key cryptography]]) can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of an arbitrary number of traitorous generals.  However, for [[safety-critical system]]s (where "security" addresses intelligent threats while "safety" addresses the inherent dangers of an activity or mission), simple error detecting codes, such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]], provide weaker but often sufficient coverage at a much lower cost.  This is true for both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Furthermore, sometimes security measures weaken safety and vice versa--Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well.&lt;ref name="PaulitschMorris2005"&gt;{{cite journal

This is illustrated by the ''Schrödinger CRC'' scenario where a CRC-protected message with a single Byzantine faulty bit presents different data to different observers and each observer sees a valid CRC.&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DriscollHall2003" /&gt;
* Also presented is a variation on the first two solutions allowing Byzantine-fault-tolerant behavior in some situations where not all generals can communicate directly with each other.

Several system architectures were designed c. 1980 that implemented Byzantine fault tolerance.  These include: Draper's FTMP,&lt;ref name="HopkinsLala1987"&gt;

==Software==
UpRight&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/upright/ UpRight]. Google Code repository for the UpRight replication library.&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source library for constructing services that tolerate both crashes ("up") and Byzantine behaviors ("right") that incorporates many of these protocols' innovations.

In addition to PBFT and UpRight, there is the BFT-SMaRt library,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bft-smart.github.io/library/ BFT-SMaRt]. Google Code
repository for the BFT-SMaRt replication library.&lt;/ref&gt; a high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication library developed in Java. This library implements a protocol very similar to PBFT's, plus complementary protocols which offer state transfer and on-the-fly reconfiguration of hosts. BFT-SMaRt is the most recent effort to implement state machine replication, still being actively maintained.

[[Archistar]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/Archistar/archistar-core Archistar]. github repository for the Archistar project.&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes a slim BFT layer&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/Archistar/archistar-bft Archistar-bft BFT state-machine]. github repository for the Archistar project.&lt;/ref&gt; for communication. It prototypes a secure multi-cloud storage system using Java licensed under LGPLv2. Focus lies on simplicity and readability, it aims to be the foundation for further research projects.

Askemos&lt;ref&gt;[http://ball.askemos.org/ Askemos/BALL] project home page&lt;/ref&gt;  is a concurrent, garbage-collected, persistent programming platform atop of replicated state machines which tolerates Byzantine faults. It prototypes an execution environment facilitating [[Smart contracts]].

Tendermint&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint Tendermint] github repository for the Tendermint project&lt;/ref&gt; is general purpose software for BFT state machine replication. Using a socket protocol, it enables state machines to be written in any programming language, and provides
means for the state machine to influence elements of the consensus, such as the list of active processes. Tendermint is implemented in the style of a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]], which amortizes the overhead of BFT and allows for faster recovery from failure.

==Product implementations==
One example of BFT in use is [[bitcoin]], a peer-to-peer digital cash system{{Citation needed|reason=Is there a proof that blockchain is BFT? |date=August 2018}}. The [[bitcoin network]] works in parallel to generate a [[blockchain]] with [[proof-of-work]] allowing the system to overcome Byzantine failures and reach a coherent global view of the system's state.

and the Boeing 787 flight control systems use Byzantine fault tolerance;  because these are real-time systems, their Byzantine fault tolerance solutions must have very low latency.  For example, SAFEbus can achieve Byzantine fault tolerance within the order of a microsecond of added latency.

Some spacecraft flight systems such as that of the [[SpaceX Dragon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/540368/ ELC: SpaceX lessons learned [LWN.net&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; consider Byzantine fault tolerance in their design.

Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms use components that repeat an incoming message (or just its signature) to other recipients of that incoming message.  All these mechanisms make the assumption that the act of repeating a message blocks the propagation of Byzantine symptoms.  For systems that have a high degree of safety or security criticality, these assumptions must be proven to be true to an acceptable level of [[fault coverage]].  When providing proof through testing, one difficulty is creating a sufficiently wide range of signals with Byzantine symptoms.&lt;ref name="NanyaGoosen1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nanya|first1=T.|last2=Goosen|first2=H.A.|title=The Byzantine hardware fault model|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems|volume=8|issue=11|year=1989|pages=1226–1231|issn=0278-0070|doi=10.1109/43.41508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such testing likely will require specialized fault injectors.&lt;ref name="MartinsGandhi2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martins|first1=Rolando|last2=Gandhi|first2=Rajeev|last3=Narasimhan|first3=Priya|last4=Pertet|first4=Soila|last5=Casimiro|first5=António|last6=Kreutz|first6=Diego|last7=Veríssimo|first7=Paulo|title=Experiences with Fault-Injection in a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Protocol|volume=8275|year=2013|pages=41–61|issn=0302-9743|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45065-5_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

'''The C-Band All Sky Survey''' ('''C-BASS''') is a [[radio astronomy]] project that aims to map the entire sky in the [[C band (IEEE)|C Band]] (5&amp;nbsp;GHz). It is to be conducted on two [[radio telescope]]s, one operating in the [[Karoo]] in [[South Africa]], and the other one in [[California]].

==Project description==
[[File:C-BASS South at Klerefontein 4.jpg|thumb|The southern C-BASS telescope in the final stages of commissioning in the Karoo.]]
The survey is a collaboration between the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Manchester]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], the [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (HartRAO), and the [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. The observations are being made with two telescopes; one based at the [[Owens Valley Radio Observatory]] (OVRO) in [[California]], United States, and the other near [[Klerefontein]] in the [[Karoo desert]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="skaMedRel"&gt;[http://www.ska.ac.za/releases/20130327.php Square Kilometer Array Media Release], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an all sky survey two ground-based telescopes are required, one in the southern and one in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="skaMedRel" /&gt; C-BASS North is a 6.1m [[Gregorian telescope]], the dish was donated to the project by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and it has started performing survey observations. C-BASS South is a 7.6-m [[Cassegrain telescope]] with a dish donated by [[Telkom (South Africa)]]. It is currently in the final stages of commissioning at [[Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory]] and is forecast to begin survey observations in 2014 when it is deployed in the Karoo. The secondary mirrors on both telescopes are supported by cones of radio-transparent foam to minimize the contamination from ground pick up and to avoid scattering the incoming polarized radiation.&lt;ref name="skaMedRel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="firstLook" /&gt;

==Scientific goals==
The survey will map not only the intensity but also the orientation of the incoming electromagnetic waves ([[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]) at every point on the sky with an [[angular resolution]] of 0.73 degrees. The angular resolution represents the smallest details that can be distinguished in the images. It is the first survey to map the sky at a frequency of 5&amp;nbsp;GHz—low enough to be [[synchrotron radiation]] dominated but high enough to be relatively unaffected by [[Faraday rotation]]. At this frequency most of the signal is coming from emissions from high-energy electrons spiraling around magnetic fields in the galaxy. This radiation is highly polarized and a major foreground distorting the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) signal.&lt;ref name="antennaDesign"&gt;{{cite journal
|arxiv=1111.2702

|pages=117–124|bibcode = 2013ITAP...61..117H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary scientific goal of the project is to aid in the subtraction of [[foreground radiation]], mainly from our own galaxy, from measurements of the CMB in order to improve the exactness of the CMB measurements. The CMB is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]], this polarization can help shed light on [[inflation theory]] and [[gravity waves]] in the [[early universe]]. Secondary goals include studying the [[magnetic field]]s within the [[Milky Way]], the WMAP Haze and [[spinning dust]].&lt;ref name="firstLook"&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1008.4082 | title=The C-Band All-Sky Survey: Instrument design status and First-look data | last1=King, | first1=O.G. | year=2010 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1117/12.858011 | journal=Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cabin pressurization''' is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

==Need for cabin pressurization==
[[File:Pxctl.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|The pressurization controls on a [[Boeing 737-800]]]]

Pressurization becomes increasingly necessary at altitudes above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]] to protect crew and passengers from the risk of a number of physiological problems caused by the low outside air pressure above that altitude. For private aircraft operating in the US, crew members are required to use oxygen masks if the cabin altitude stays above 12,500&amp;nbsp;ft for more than 30 minutes, or if the cabin altitude reaches 14,000&amp;nbsp;ft at any time. At altitudes above 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft, passengers are required to be provided oxygen masks as well. On commercial aircraft, the cabin altitude must be maintained at 8,000&amp;nbsp;ft or less. Pressurization of the cargo hold is also required to prevent damage to pressure-sensitive goods that might leak, expand, burst or be crushed on re-pressurization. The principal physiological problems are listed below.

; [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]]
: The lower [[partial pressure]] of oxygen at altitude reduces the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] oxygen tension in the lungs and subsequently in the brain, leading to sluggish thinking, dimmed vision, loss of consciousness, and ultimately death. In some individuals, particularly those with heart or lung disease, symptoms may begin as low as {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, although most passengers can tolerate altitudes of {{convert|8000|ft|m}} without ill effect. At this altitude, there is about 25% less oxygen than there is at sea level.&lt;ref name="02_calc"&gt;{{cite web | author=K. Baillie and A. Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/air_pressure.php | accessdate=2006-08-13}} – Online interactive altitude oxygen calculator&lt;/ref&gt;
: Hypoxia may be addressed by the administration of supplemental oxygen, either through an [[oxygen mask]] or through a [[nasal cannula]]. Without pressurization, sufficient oxygen can be delivered up to an altitude of about {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. This is because a person who is used to living at sea level needs about 0.20&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|bar]] [[Partial pressure of oxygen|partial oxygen pressure]] to function normally and that pressure can be maintained up to about {{convert|40000|ft|m}} by increasing the [[mole fraction]] of oxygen in the air that is being breathed. At {{convert|40000|ft|m}}, the ambient air pressure falls to about 0.2 bar, at which maintaining a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 bar requires breathing 100% oxygen using an [[oxygen mask]].
: Emergency oxygen supply masks in the passenger compartment of airliners do not need to be [[oxygen masks|pressure-demand masks]] because most flights stay below {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Above that altitude the partial pressure of oxygen will fall below 0.2 bar even at 100% oxygen and some degree of cabin pressurization or rapid descent will be essential to avoid the risk of hypoxia.
; [[Altitude sickness]]
: [[Hyperventilation]], the body's most common response to hypoxia, does help to partially restore the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, but it also causes [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to out-gas, raising the blood pH and inducing [[alkalosis]]. Passengers may experience fatigue, [[nausea]], headaches, sleeplessness, and (on extended flights) even [[pulmonary oedema]]. These are the same symptoms that mountain climbers experience, but the limited duration of powered flight makes the development of pulmonary oedema unlikely. Altitude sickness may be controlled by a full [[pressure suit]] with helmet and faceplate, which completely envelops the body in a pressurized environment; however, this is impractical for commercial passengers.
; [[Decompression sickness]]
: The low partial pressure of gases, principally nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but including all other gases, may cause dissolved gases in the bloodstream to precipitate out, resulting in ''gas embolism'', or bubbles in the bloodstream. The mechanism is the same as that of compressed-air divers on ascent from depth. Symptoms may include the early symptoms of "the bends"—tiredness, forgetfulness, headache, stroke, thrombosis, and subcutaneous itching—but rarely the full symptoms thereof. Decompression sickness may also be controlled by a full-pressure suit as for altitude sickness.
; [[Barotrauma]]
: As the aircraft climbs or descends, passengers may experience discomfort or acute pain as gases trapped within their bodies expand or contract. The most common problems occur with air trapped in the [[middle ear]] (aerotitus) or paranasal sinuses by a blocked [[Eustachian tube]] or sinuses. Pain may also be experienced in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] or even the teeth ([[barodontalgia]]). Usually these are not severe enough to cause actual trauma but can result in soreness in the ear that persists after the flight and can exacerbate or precipitate pre-existing medical conditions, such as [[pneumothorax]].

==Cabin altitude==
[[File:CabinAltitudeQF744.jpg|thumb|An empty bottle, sealed at 37,000ft, is crushed on descent to sea level, compared with one in its original state.]]
The pressure inside the cabin is technically referred to as the ''equivalent effective cabin altitude'' or more commonly as the ''cabin altitude''. This is defined as the equivalent altitude above [[sea level|mean sea level]] having the same [[atmospheric pressure]] according to a standard atmospheric model such as the [[International Standard Atmosphere]]. Thus a cabin altitude of zero would have the pressure found at mean sea level, which is taken to be {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|sigfig=5}}.&lt;ref name="aeromech.usyd.edu.au"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Auld | first = D.

===Aircraft===
In [[airliner]]s, cabin altitude during flight is kept above sea level in order to reduce stress on the pressurized part of the [[fuselage]]; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin. In a typical commercial passenger flight, the cabin altitude is programmed to rise gradually from the altitude of the airport of origin to a regulatory maximum of {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This cabin altitude is maintained while the aircraft is cruising at its maximum altitude and then reduced gradually during descent until the cabin pressure matches the ambient air pressure at the destination.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Keeping the cabin altitude below {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}} generally prevents significant [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]], [[altitude sickness]], [[decompression sickness]], and [[barotrauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.iata.org/publications/Documents/medical-manual.pdf |title=Medical Manual 9th Edition| ISBN =978-92-9229-445-8 |publisher=International Air Transport Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulations in the U.S. mandate that under normal operating conditions, the cabin altitude may not exceed this limit at the maximum operating altitude of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1790988|title=Commercial aircraft cabin altitude|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=100|issue=2|page=64|author=Bagshaw M|year=2007|doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.2.64-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandatory maximum cabin altitude does not eliminate all physiological problems; passengers with conditions such as [[pneumothorax]] are advised not to fly until fully healed, and people suffering from a cold or other infection may still experience pain in the ears and sinuses.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The rate of change of cabin altitude strongly affects comfort as humans are sensitive to pressure changes in the [[inner ear]] and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinuses]] and this has to be managed carefully. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers flying within the "no fly" period after a dive are at risk of [[decompression sickness]] because the accumulated nitrogen in their bodies can form bubbles when exposed to reduced cabin pressure.

The cabin altitude of the [[Boeing 767]] is typically about {{convert|7000|ft|m}} when cruising at {{convert|37000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/cabinair/ecs.pdf|title=Commercial Airliner Environmental Control System: Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air Quality|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524110211/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/cabinair/ecs.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typical for older jet airliners.

Before 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were type-certificated to fly up to {{convert|45000|ft|m|abbr=on}} without having to meet high-altitude special conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|title=Final Policy FAR Part 25 Sec. 25.841 07/05/1996&amp;#124;Attachment 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25-87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin pressure specifications for new-type aircraft designs. Aircraft certified to operate above {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} "must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system".&lt;ref name="FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_25-841.html|title=FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a decompression that results from "any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable", the plane must be designed such that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for more than 2 minutes, nor to an altitude exceeding {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} at any time.&lt;ref name="FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841"/&gt; In practice, that new [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] amendment imposes an operational [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.&lt;ref name="Exemption No. 8695"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/9929ce16709cad0f8625713f00551e74/$FILE/8695.doc|title=Exemption No. 8695|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|location=Renton, Washington|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|title=PS-ANM-03-112-16|accessdate=2009-09-23|author=Steve Happenny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft manufacturers can apply for a relaxation of this rule if the circumstances warrant it. In 2004, [[Airbus]] acquired an FAA exemption to allow the cabin altitude of the A380 to reach {{Convert|43,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed {{Convert|40,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one minute. This allows the A380 to operate at a higher altitude than other newly designed civilian aircraft.&lt;ref name="Exemption No. 8695"/&gt;

===Spacecraft===
Russian engineers used an air-like nitrogen/oxygen mixture, kept at a cabin altitude near zero at all times, in their 1961 [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]], 1964 [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]], and 1967 to present [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a heavier [[space vehicle]] design, because the spacecraft cabin structure must withstand the stress of 14.7 pounds per square inch (1 bar) against the vacuum of space, and also because an inert nitrogen mass must be carried. Care must also be taken to avoid [[decompression sickness]] when cosmonauts perform [[extravehicular activity]], as current soft [[space suit]]s are pressurized with pure oxygen at relatively low pressure in order to provide reasonable flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the United States used a pure oxygen atmosphere for its 1961 [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], 1965 [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and 1967 [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]] spacecraft, mainly in order to avoid decompression sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Catchpole|first=John|title=Project Mercury – NASA's First Manned Space Programme|year=2001|publisher=Springer Praxis|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=1-85233-406-1|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |date=Spring 1998 |title ='Fire in the Cockpit!' |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury used a cabin altitude of {{convert|24800|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.5|psi|bar}});&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Gemini used an altitude of {{convert|25700|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}});&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and Apollo used {{convert|27,000|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.0|psi|bar|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 278, 284&lt;/ref&gt; in space. This allowed for a lighter space vehicle design. Before launch, the pressure was kept at slightly higher than sea level at a constant {{convert|5.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}} above ambient for Gemini, and {{convert|2|psi|bar|abbr=on}} above sea level at launch for Apollo), and transitioned to the space cabin altitude during ascent. However, the high pressure pure oxygen atmosphere proved to be a fatal fire hazard in Apollo, contributing to the deaths of the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]] during a 1967 ground test. After this, [[NASA]] revised its procedure to use a 40% nitrogen/60% oxygen mix at zero cabin altitude at launch, but kept the low-pressure pure oxygen in space.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the [[Apollo program]], the United States used air-like cabin atmospheres{{clarify|date=December 2015}} for [[Skylab]], the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], and the [[International Space Station]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Mechanics==
Pressurization is achieved by the design of an airtight fuselage engineered to be pressurized with a source of compressed air and controlled by an [[environmental control system]] (ECS). The most common source of compressed air for pressurization is [[bleed air]] extracted from the compressor stage of a [[gas turbine]] engine, from a low or intermediate stage and also from an additional high stage; the exact stage can vary depending on engine type. By the time the cold outside air has reached the bleed air valves, it is at a very high pressure and has been heated to around {{convert|200|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The control and selection of high or low bleed sources is fully automatic and is governed by the needs of various pneumatic systems at various stages of flight.&lt;ref name="Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinfiles.com/?CFrequest=file;03032001100119 |title=Commercial Airliner Environmental Control System: Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air |dead-url=yes |format=PDF |year=1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331055732/http://www.cabinfiles.com/?CFrequest=file%3B03032001100119 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of the bleed air that is directed to the ECS is then expanded to bring it to cabin pressure, which cools it. A final, suitable temperature is then achieved by adding back heat from the hot compressed air via a [[heat exchanger]] and [[air cycle machine]] known as the packs system. In some larger airliners, hot trim air can be added downstream of air conditioned air coming from the packs if it is needed to warm a section of the cabin that is colder than others.

[[File:Outflow.jpg|thumb|left|Outflow and pressure relief valve on a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]]]
At least two engines provide compressed bleed air for all the plane's pneumatic systems, to provide full [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. Compressed air is also obtained from the [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU), if fitted, in the event of an emergency and for cabin air supply on the ground before the main engines are started. Most modern commercial aircraft today have fully redundant, duplicated electronic controllers for maintaining pressurization along with a manual back-up control system.

All exhaust air is dumped to atmosphere via an outflow valve, usually at the rear of the fuselage. This valve controls the cabin pressure and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the cabin pressure valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper cabin pressure altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between {{convert|7.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|9.4|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="Differential Pressure Characteristics of Aircraft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrcabinpressure.com/aircraft.htm|title=Differential Pressure Characteristics of Aircraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|39000|ft|m}}, the cabin pressure would be automatically maintained at about {{convert|6900|ft|m}} ({{convert|450|ft|m}} lower than Mexico City), which is about {{convert|11.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} of atmosphere pressure.&lt;ref name="Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air"/&gt;

Some aircraft, such as the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], have re-introduced electric compressors previously used on piston-engined airliners to provide pressurization.&lt;ref name="AERO_QTR_406_787_from_the_ground_up"&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_06/AERO_Q406_article4.pdf "Boeing 787 from the Ground Up"]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of electric compressors increases the electrical generation load on the engines and introduces a number of stages of energy transfer; therefore, it is unclear whether this increases the overall efficiency of the aircraft air handling system. It does, however, remove the danger of [[Fume event|chemical contamination of the cabin]], simplify engine design, avert the need to run high pressure pipework around the aircraft, and provide greater design flexibility.

==Unplanned decompression==
{{Main|Uncontrolled decompression}}
[[File:Passenger oxygen mask dsc06035.jpg|thumb|upright|Passenger oxygen mask deployment]]

Unplanned loss of cabin pressure at altitude is rare but has resulted in a [[Uncontrolled decompression#Notable decompression accidents and incidents|number of fatal accidents]]. Failures range from sudden, catastrophic loss of airframe integrity (explosive decompression) to slow leaks or equipment malfunctions that allow cabin pressure to drop undetected to levels that can lead to unconsciousness or severe performance degradation of the aircrew.

Any failure of cabin pressurization above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} requires an emergency descent to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} or the closest to that while maintaining the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), and the deployment of an [[oxygen mask]] for each seat. The oxygen systems have sufficient oxygen for all on board and give the pilots adequate time to descend to below {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Without emergency oxygen, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may lead to loss of consciousness and a subsequent loss of control of the aircraft. The [[time of useful consciousness]] varies according to altitude. As the pressure falls the cabin air temperature may also plummet to the ambient outside temperature with a danger of [[hypothermia]] or [[frostbite]].

In [[jet fighter]] aircraft, the small size of the [[cockpit]] means that any decompression will be very rapid and would not allow the pilot time to put on an oxygen mask. Therefore, fighter jet pilots and aircrew are required to wear oxygen masks at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goflightmedicine.com/hypoxia/ |title=Hypoxia |last1=Jedick MD/MBA |first1=Rocky |last2= |first2= |date=28 April 2013 |website=goflightmedicine.com |publisher=Go Flight Medicine |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1971, the crew of [[Soyuz 11]], Soviet cosmonauts [[Georgy Dobrovolsky]], [[Vladislav Volkov]], and [[Viktor Patsayev]] were killed after the cabin vent valve accidentally opened before atmospheric re-entry.

==History==
The aircraft that pioneered pressurized cabin systems include:
* [[Packard-Le Père LUSAC-11]], (1920, a modified French design, not actually pressurized but with an enclosed, oxygen enriched cockpit)
* [[Engineering Division USD-9A]], a modified [[Airco DH.9A]] (1921 – the first aircraft to fly with the addition of a pressurized cockpit module)
* [[Junkers Ju 49]] (1931 – a German experimental aircraft purpose-built to test the concept of cabin pressurization)

* [[Chizhevski BOK-1]] (1936 – a Russian experimental aircraft)
* [[Lockheed XC-35]] (1937 – an American pressurized aircraft. Rather than a pressure capsule enclosing the cockpit, the [[monocoque]] fuselage skin was the pressure vessel.)
* [[Renard R.35]] (1938 – the first pressurized piston airliner, which crashed on first flight)
* [[Boeing 307]] (1938 – the first pressurized airliner to enter commercial service)
* [[Lockheed Constellation]] (1943 – the first pressurized airliner in wide service)
* [[Avro Tudor]] (1946 – first British pressurized airliner)
* [[de Havilland Comet]] (British, Comet 1 1949 – the first jetliner, Comet 4 1958 – resolving the Comet 1 problems)
* [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and [[Concorde]] (1968 USSR and 1969 Anglo-French respectively – first to operate at very high altitude)
* [[SyberJet SJ30]] (2005) First civilian business jet to certify 12.0 psi pressurization system allowing for a sea level cabin at {{convert|41000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

In the late 1910s, attempts were being made to achieve higher and higher altitudes. In 1920, flights well over {{convert|37000|ft|m|abbr=on}} were first achieved by test pilot Lt. [[John A. Macready]] in a [[Packard-Le Père LUSAC-11]] biplane at [[McCook Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelisse, Diana G.|title=Splended Vision, Unswerving Purpose; Developing Air Power for the United States Air Force During the First Century of Powered Flight|location=Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio|publisher=U.S. Air Force Publications|year=2002|isbn=0-16-067599-5|pages=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was possible by releasing stored oxygen into the cockpit, which was released directly into an enclosed cabin and not to an oxygen mask, which was developed later.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; With this system flights nearing {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} were possible, but the lack of atmospheric pressure at that altitude caused the pilot's heart to enlarge visibly, and many pilots reported health problems from such high altitude flights.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; Some early airliners had oxygen masks for the passengers for routine flights.

In 1921, a Wright-Dayton USD-9A reconnaissance biplane was modified with the addition of a completely enclosed air-tight chamber that could be pressurized with air forced into it by small external turbines.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The chamber had a hatch only {{convert|22|in|m|abbr=on}} in diameter that would be sealed by the pilot at {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The chamber contained only one instrument, an altimeter, while the conventional cockpit instruments were all mounted outside the chamber, visible through five small portholes.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The first attempt to operate the aircraft was again made by Lt. John A. McCready, who discovered that the turbine was forcing air into the chamber faster than the small release valve provided could release it.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; As a result, the chamber quickly over pressurized, and the flight was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; A second attempt had to be abandoned when the pilot discovered at {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} that he was too short to close the chamber hatch.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The first successful flight was finally made by test pilot Lt. Harrold Harris, making it the world's first flight by a pressurized aircraft.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt;

The first airliner with a pressurized cabin was the [[Boeing 307]] Stratoliner, built in 1938, prior to [[World War II]], though only ten were produced. The 307's "pressure compartment was from the nose of the aircraft to a pressure [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] in the aft just forward of the horizontal stabilizer."&lt;ref&gt;William A. Schoneberger and Robert R. H. Scholl, ''Out of Thin Air: Garrett's First 50 Years'', Phoenix: Garrett Corporation, 1985 ({{ISBN|0-9617029-0-7}}), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B-8 winter helmet &amp; A-14 oxygen mask (1944).jpg|thumb|World War II era flying helmet and oxygen mask]]
World War II was a catalyst for aircraft development. Initially, the piston aircraft of World War II, though they often flew at very high altitudes, were not pressurized and relied on oxygen masks.&lt;ref&gt;Some extremely high flying aircraft such as the [[Westland Welkin]] used partial pressurization to reduce the effort of using an oxygen mask.&lt;/ref&gt; This became impractical with the development of larger bombers where crew were required to move about the cabin and this led to the first bomber with cabin pressurization (though restricted to crew areas), the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. The control system for this was designed by [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett AiResearch Manufacturing Company]], drawing in part on licensing of patents held by Boeing for the Stratoliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seymour L. Chapin |title=Garrett and Pressurized Flight: A Business Built on Thin Air |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=35 |issue= 3|pages=329–43 |date=August 1966 |doi=10.2307/3636792|jstor=3636792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war piston airliners such as the [[Lockheed Constellation]] (1943) extended the technology to civilian service. The piston engined airliners generally relied on electrical compressors to provide pressurized cabin air. Engine supercharging and cabin pressurization enabled planes like the [[Douglas DC-6]], the [[Douglas DC-7]], and the Constellation to have certified service ceilings from {{convert|24000|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|28400|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Designing a pressurized fuselage to cope with that altitude range was within the engineering and metallurgical knowledge of that time. The introduction of jet airliners required a significant increase in cruise altitudes to the {{convert|30000|-|41000|ft|m|abbr=on}} range, where jet engines are more fuel efficient. That increase in cruise altitudes required far more rigorous engineering of the fuselage, and in the beginning not all the engineering problems were fully understood.

The world’s first commercial jet airliner was the British [[de Havilland Comet]] (1949) designed with a service ceiling of {{convert|36000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It was the first time that a large diameter, pressurized fuselage with windows had been built and flown at this altitude. Initially, the design was very successful but [[South African Airways Flight 201#Official investigation|two catastrophic airframe failures in 1954]] resulting in the total loss of the aircraft, passengers and crew grounded what was then the entire world jet airliner fleet. Extensive investigation and groundbreaking engineering analysis of the wreckage led to a number of very significant engineering advances that solved the basic problems of pressurized fuselage design at altitude. The critical problem proved to be a combination of an inadequate understanding of the effect of progressive [[metal fatigue]] as the fuselage undergoes repeated stress cycles coupled with a misunderstanding of how aircraft skin stresses are redistributed around openings in the fuselage such as windows and rivet holes.

The critical engineering principles concerning metal fatigue learned from the Comet 1 program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behaviour of Skin Fatigue Cracks at the Corners of Windows in a Comet Fuselage|author=R.J. Atkinson, W.J. Winkworth and G.M. Norris|journal=Aeronautrical Research Council Reports and Memoranda|year=1962|citeseerx=10.1.1.226.7667}}&lt;/ref&gt; were applied directly to the design of the [[Boeing 707]] (1957) and all subsequent jet airliners. One immediately noticeable legacy of the Comet disasters is the oval windows on every jet airliner; the metal fatigue cracks that destroyed the Comets were initiated by the small radius corners on the Comet 1’s almost square windows. The Comet fuselage was redesigned and the Comet 4 (1958) went on to become a successful airliner, pioneering the first transatlantic jet service, but the program never really recovered from these disasters and was overtaken by the Boeing 707.

The [[Concorde]] had to deal with particularly high pressure differentials because it flew at unusually high altitude (up to {{convert|60000|ft|m}}) and maintained a cabin altitude of {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepburn|first1=A.N.|title=Human Factors in the Concord|journal=Occupational Medicine|date=1967|volume=17|issue=2|pages=47–51|doi=10.1093/occmed/17.2.47|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the aircraft significantly heavier and contributed to the high cost of a flight. The Concorde also had smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft in order to slow the rate of decompression if a window failed.&lt;ref name = 'nunn'&gt;{{cite book |title=Nunn's applied respiratory physiology |first = John Francis |last = Nunn |publisher=Butterworth-Heineman |isbn = 0-7506-1336-X |year = 1993 |page = 341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cruising altitude also required the use of high pressure oxygen and [[Diving regulator#Demand valve|demand valves]] at the emergency masks unlike the [[Oxygen mask|continuous-flow masks]] used in conventional airliners.

The designed operating cabin altitude for new aircraft is falling and this is expected to reduce any remaining physiological problems.

'''Choto Shona Mosque''' ({{lang-bn|ছোট সোনা মসজিদ}}, ''Small Golden Mosque'') is located in [[Chapai Nawabganj]] district of Bangladesh. The mosque is situated about {{convert|3|km}} south of the Kotwali Gate and {{convert|0.5|km}} to the south-east of the [[Mughal Tahakhana]] complex in the [[Firozpur Quarter]].

==History==
[[File:Choto Sona Mosque 1808.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque in 1808]]
[[File:Sona Masjid rear.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque (rear view)]]
The mosque was built during the reign of [[Alauddin Husain Shah|Sultan Hussain Shah]], between 1493 and 1519. The fifteen domes of the mosque were once gilded, giving the mosque the name of ''Choto Shona Masjid'' (''Small Golden Mosque'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangladesh.com/religious-sites/chhota-sona-masjid/ Chhota Sona Masjid. Gaur | By Bangladesh Channel]. Bangladesh.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque is one of the best-preserved [[sultana (title)|sultana]] monuments under protection by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Governments of Bangladesh. The gilding that gave the building its name does not exist anymore. The mosque premise, which covers an area of 42 m from east to west by 43.5 m from north to south, was originally surrounded by an outer wall (now restored) with a gateway in the middle of the east side.
[[File:Sona2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque at the entrance with a short history of the mosque]]

==Design==
[[File:ছোট সোনা মসজিদ, চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ.jpg|thumb|Choto Sona Mosque, view from outside]]
Built of brick and stone, the mosque proper forms a rectangle having outside dimensions of {{convert|25.1|m|ft}} from north to south and {{convert|15.9|m|ft}} from east to west. All the four walls are veneered externally and to some extent also internally with granite stone blocks. These stones have disappeared from the southern side of the west wall because of conservation works after the destruction by the [[1897 Assam earthquake|earthquake of 1897]]. The four exterior angles of the building are strengthened with polygonal towers, of which nine facets are visible. The cornices are curvilinear and have stone gutters to drain off the rain water from the roof. There are five arched doorways in the eastern facade and three each on the north and south walls. Corresponding to the five archways in the east wall there are five semi-circular ''mihrabs'' inside the west wall. The stones of most of these miharbs have disappeared.

The interior of the mosque, measuring {{convert|21.2|by|12.2|m}}, is divided into three aisles by two rows of stone pillars, four in each row. A wide central nave has cut the aisles into halves, each half showing six equal square units with a side of 3.5 m. The nave has three rectangular units, each measuring 3.5 by 4.5 m. The interior of the mosque has therefore a total of fifteen units, of which the three rectangular units are covered with ''chauchala'' vaults, and the remaining twelve square units each by an inverted tumbler-shaped dome. They are all carried on radiating arches springing from the free-standing stone pillars and the engaged pilasters. The upper corners in between the arches of the square units are filled with corbelled brick pendentive to make up the phase of transition for the domes. At the northwest corner of the mosque there is a royal gallery forming an upper floor, which is still standing in a dilapidated condition. It was approached from the northwest corner of the mosque through a stepped platform connected with a doorway. The gallery has a mihrab in front.

Stone carving, brick-setting, terracotta, gilding and glazed tiles were used in decorating the building, and of them the former played the dominant role. The subject matters of the stone carving were chosen according to the demand of the spaces, e.g., the borders of the panels with creepers and their interior with various forms of stylised hanging patterns adapted from the chain-and-bell of the Bauddha and Jaina period. The spandrels of arches and the spaces above the frames are always dotted with rosettes, an attractive form of designs, but are all carved differently. The interior of the domes and vaults are decorated with terracottas, those of the vaults being copies of the bamboo frames of local huts. All the frontal archways and those of the ''mihrabs'' are cusped.

[[File:Side view of Sona Mosjid.jpg|thumb|Side view of Sona Mosjid]]
==Ornamentation==
The most important ornamentation of the mosque is to be seen on the frontal courtyard of the mosque, only recently excavated. The ornamentation consists of mosaic roundels in blue and white colours of variegated design. The mosaic design is not ''in situ'', but a roundel has been composed by the excavators, putting the flakes in their appropriate places and exhibiting it in a room attached to the guesthouse nearby. At a distance of 14.5 m to the east of the gateway there is a stone platform containing two tomb sarcophagi inscribed with verses from the Quran and some names of God. It is unknown who is buried here. Cunningham suggests these are the tombs of Wali Muhammad, the builder of the mosque, and his father Ali.

==Current situation==
The glamour of the Chhoto Sona Masjid is not there as it was originally, particularly because of the stripping of the decorative mihrabs and the mosque courtyard, but the remains are nevertheless one of the most attractive monuments of Guar-Lakhnauti.

== Experiments of Chromosome Engineering ==

In an experiment pertaining to chromosome engineering that was conducted in 2006, it was found that chromosome engineering can be effectively used as a method of identifying the causes of genetic disorders such as the continuous gene and aneuploidy syndromes. The experiment was conducted by infecting mice with the human disease, ES, to see the effectiveness of chromosomal engineering in the gene identification of those diseases. After much experimenting, it was found that manipulating chromosomes, or chromosome engineering, is an excellent and efficient method of determining underlying genes in genetic orders and diseases.{{fact|date=April 2015}}

In the future, chromosome engineering will experiment in removing more common disorders such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. If it can be recognized by the medical community as effective and safe, it should be able to be used regularly in the near future.{{fact|date=April 2015}}

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]], '''circumscription''' is the definition of a [[taxon]], that is, a group of [[organisms]].

One goal of biological taxonomy is to achieve a stable circumscription for every taxon.  Achieving stability is not yet a certainty in most taxa, and many that had been regarded as stable for decades are in upheaval in the light of rapid developments in [[molecular phylogenetics]]. In essence, new discoveries may invalidate the application of irrelevant attributes used in established or obsolete circumscriptions, or present new attributes useful in [[cladistic taxonomy]]. 

An example of a taxonomic group with unstable circumscription is [[Anacardiaceae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s. Some experts favor a circumscription&lt;ref&gt;[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm Anacardiaceae] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315000926/http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm |date=March 15, 2005 }} in [http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ L.

{{for|clausula in medieval music|Clausula (music)}}

In Roman rhetoric, a '''clausula''' /'klɔːzi̯ʊlə/ (Latin "little close or conclusion"; plural ''clausulae'' /'klɔːzi̯ʊli/) was a [[Foot (prosody)|rhythmic figure]] used to add finesse and finality to the end of a sentence or phrase. There was a large range of popular clausulae. Most well known is the classically Ciceronian ''esse videatur'' type.

Every long sentence can be divided into rhythmical ''cola'' (singular ''colon''), in Latin ''membra'' (singular ''membrum''), and the last few syllables of every colon tend to conform to certain favourite rhythmic patterns, which are known as ''clausulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek (1985), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter ''cola'' were known as ''commata'' /ˈkɒmətə/ (singular ''comma''), in Latin ''incisa'' (singular ''incisum''), which also often display rhythmic endings.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham (1957), p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clausulae in Cicero's speeches==

The constant use of clausulae in Cicero's speeches was first thoroughly investigated by the Polish philologist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|Tadeusz Zieliński]] in a monumental work published in German in 1904, following an earlier dissertation by G. Wüst in 1881 and work by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Zieliński established that a Ciceronian clausula had two parts: a "base", generally a cretic | – u – | or a variation on it, and a "cadence", generally of a [[trochee|trochaic]] rhythm such as | – x |, | – u x |, or | – u – x |.&lt;ref name=Sre150&gt;Srebrny (1947 (2013)), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; (Here "–" indicates a long syllable, "u" a short syllable, and "x" a syllable which can be either long or short.)

The most common clausulae in Cicero are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*| – u – | – x | and variations (32.4% of Cicero's clausulae)
*| – x – | – u x | (24.4%)
*| – x – | – u – x | (30.1%)

Variations may include resolving one of the long syllables in the rhythm into two short ones, for example | – u uu | – x | (''esse videatur'') instead of | – u – | – x |. Another type of allowable variation is to substitute | – uu – | or | – u – – | for the base.&lt;ref name=Cla167&gt;Clark (1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above clausulae account for about 87% of Cicero's clausulae. Other clausulae are rarer. For example, the cadence may have five elements | – u – u – | or consist of two [[spondee]]s | – – – – |. This last type (commoner in Livy than in Cicero) is compared by Zieliński to the blows of a hammer.&lt;ref name=Cla167 /&gt; Certain clausulae, such as the [[hexameter]] ending | – u u | – x |, were avoided (it occurs in Cicero, but only in about 0.6% of cases, and often for a reason such a mock-heroic description).&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Zieliński noted that Cicero's preferences changed gradually over the years. For example, the rhythm | – – – | – u x | was more common in his earlier speeches, while from his consulate onwards he preferred the lighter | – u – | – u x |.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zieliński, it is a principle of clausulae that the word-accent tends to follow the ictus of the feet, that is, there is usually an accent on the first syllable of the base and on the penultimate long syllable of the cadence, e.g. ''ílla tempéstas'', ''egéstas audácia'', ''incéndium civitátis'', ''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are often exceptions to this rule, and Cicero was not so strict as later writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Arnobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Dennison (1970), §16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that the skilful use of clausulae was one of the techniques which an orator used to excite an audience. Cicero writes of one occasion when the use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double [[trochee]] – u – x) by the orator [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo|Carbo the Younger]] was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 214; cf. Adams (2013), p. 8; Cunningham (1957), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples from Cicero==
An example of Cicero's use of clausulae in a speech is given below, with the two sentences divided into cola:&lt;ref&gt;Grillo (2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Ecce '''ílla tempéstas''', | – u – | – – | 
::cālīgo bonorum et subita atque impro'''vísa formído''', | – u – | – – | 
::téne'''brae rei públicae''', | – u – | – u – |
::ruina atque in'''céndium civitátis''', | – u – | – u – – | 
::terror iniectus '''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis''', | – u – | – u – – |
::metus cáe'''dis bonis ómnibus''', | – u – | – u – | 
::consulum scelus, cupiditas, e'''géstas, audácia'''! | – – – | – u – |
 
::Si non sum ad'''iútus, non débui'''; | – – – | – u – |
::si desertus, sibi for'''tásse provídit'''; | – u – | – – |
::si etiam oppugnatus, ut quid(am) '''áut putant áut volunt''', | – u – | – u – |
::vio'''lát(a) amicítia (e)st''', | – u – | uu – | 
::'''áccep(i) iniúriam'''; | – – – | – u – | 
::inimicus esse '''débui, nón nego'''. | – u – | – u – |&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Provinciis consularibus'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behold that storm, the gloom of good men and a sudden and unforeseen fear, the darkness of the republic, the ruin and conflagration of the state, terror given to Caesar concerning his acts, fear of slaughter for all good men, the wickedness, greed, indigence, and audacity of the consuls! If I was not helped, I did not deserve it; if I was deserted, perhaps he was providing for his own safety; if I was even attacked, as certain people either think or wish, our friendship was violated, I received an injury; I should have been his enemy, I do not deny it."

The "heroic clausula" (– uu – x), which resembles a hexameter ending, is rare but can be used for comic effect, as in the following quotation from ''pro Caelio'':&lt;ref&gt;''pro Caelio'' §63; cf. Adams (2013), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::In '''bálneis delituérunt''': | – u – | – uu – – |
::'''téstis egrégios'''! | – – – | uu – |
::'''Déin temerē prósiluérunt''': | – uu – | – uu – – |
::'''homines témperántis'''! | uu – | – u – – |

:"They hid in the baths. Outstanding witnesses! Then they rashly leapt out. Cool-headed men!"

As Adams points out, the passage is made even more funny by the pun on ''testes'', which can mean "testicles" as well as "witnesses".

The following passage from the 2nd Catilinarian oration shows some of the less commonly used cadences, including the five-syllable | – u – u – | and the "hammer-blow" spondaic | – – – – |:&lt;ref&gt;''in Catilinam'' 6; cf. Riggsby (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
::Non est iam '''lénitatí locus'''; | – u – | – u – |
::severi'''tátem res ípsa flágitat'''. | – – – | – u – u – |
::'''Ún(um) etiam núnc concédam''': | – uu – | – – – – |
::exe'''ánt, proficiscántur'''; | – uu – | – – |
::ne patiantur desiderio sui Catilinam '''míserum tabéscere'''. | uu – – | – u – |
::Demons'''tráb(o) iter: Auréliā viā proféctus est'''; | – uu – | – u – u – u – u – |
::si accelerare volent, ad '''vésperam cónsequéntur'''. | – u – | – u – – |

:"There is no place for leniency any longer; the situation itself calls for severity. But one thing I will concede even now: let them go out, let them depart; let them not allow Catiline to pine away miserably with desire for them. I will show them the route: he departed by the Aurelian Way. If they are willing to hurry, by evening they will catch up with him."

It is characteristic of the emphatic spondaic ending (– – – –) that in Cicero there is always a word-break between the base and the cadence. With the clausula – u – – x on the other hand, as in ''illa tempestas'', the most usual place for a word-break is after the second syllable.&lt;ref name="Cla167"/&gt;

The following passage from the ''pro Scauro'' is analysed explicitly by Cicero himself into four ''incisa'' (commata), followed by two ''membra'' (cola), and then a long spondaic period ending in a ''dichoreus'' or double trochee:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 222–26; analysed in Cunningham (1957), pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;
::do'''mús tibi déerat'''? at habébas. | u | – u – | – – || uu – – |
::pe'''cúnia superábat'''? at egébas. | u | – u uu | – – || uu – – |
::incur'''ríst(i) amens ín colúmnas''', | – – | – – – | – u – – |
::in alienos in'''sánus insanísti'''; | u u u – – – | – u – | – – – |
::depressam, cae'''cám, iacentém domum''' | – – – – | – u – | – u – |
::pluris quam t(e) et quam fortu'''nás tuas áestimásti'''. | – – – – – – – | – u – | – u – – |

:"Did you lack a house? No, you already had one. Did you have enough money? No, you didn't have any. You ran madly into the columns, you raged crazily against other people's slaves; you reckoned a decrepit, dark, fallen down house as worth more than yourself and your fortunes."

Cicero comments that the ''incisa'' (commata), because of their shortness, are rather freer in their rhythm, and should be used "like little daggers". The rhythmical period (''numerosa comprehensio''), he says, is a longer sentence composed of at least two cola, and is more sparingly used. The style which consists of a mixture of commata, cola, and the occasional longer period is particularly effective, he says, in passages arguing a case or refuting one.

==Clausulae in other writers==
Clausulae are found not only in Cicero but in many Roman (as well as Greek and medieval) writers, especially in oratory but also in other types of writing. Each writer has their own preferences and "rhythmic signature".&lt;ref name=Sre150 /&gt; For example, Livy avoids clausulae which are common in Cicero, such as | – u – | – x |, but frequently ends a sentence with a series of long syllables, for example ''legati Roman(i) occurrērunt''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 167, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest orator to make extensive use of rhythmic prose in Greek is said to have been the sophist [[Thrasymachus]] of Chalcedon (the same person who appears as a speaker in book 1 of Plato's ''Republic'').&lt;ref name=Cla164&gt;Clark (1905), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] himself favoured the clausulae | – u – | – u x |, | – – – | – u x |, and | – u u | – u x |, among others. His preferences changed in the course of his life, and he used | u u u x | and | – u u u – x | more often in the later works.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysias]], [[Aeschines]], [[Isaeus]], [[Plutarch]] and others also had their own preferences. Clausulae are prominent in the orations of [[Demosthenes]], especially the ditrochaeus (– u – x), dispondaeus (– – – x), cretic + trochee (– u – – x), and choriamb + trochee (– uu – – x).&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt; But his most characteristic practice (known as "Blass's Law") is to avoid series of more than three short syllables anywhere in his sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers such as [[Thucydides]], wrote prose almost free of rhythmical influence, however.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, rhythmical prose was characteristic of the so-called "Asiatic" style of oratory, whereas followers of the plainer "Attic" style avoided it.&lt;ref name="Cla164"/&gt; The younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Suetonius]], [[Apuleius]] and [[Tertullian]] more or less followed the Ciceronian pattern, though several writers avoided | – – – | – u x | and the famous ''esse videatur'' clausula, as being overly Ciceronian.&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §17f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval clausulae (''cursus'')==

In the medieval period, Latin ceased to be pronounced in a quantitative way, and clausulae tended to be accentual rather than based on quantity. Three end-of-sentence rhythms were especially favoured, the so called ''planus'' (– x x – x) (where – indicates an accented syllable and x an unaccented one), the ''tardus'' (– x x – x x), and the ''velox'' (– x x x x – x). These rhythms are found for example in the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] (6th century), [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and [[Héloïse]] (12th century), and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (13th-14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §21.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to modern scholars (although apparently not to the medieval writers themselves) as ''cursus''. However, not all writers made use of them.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors of the period specified that the last word of the sentence had to be of either three or four syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient writers on clausulae==
The first writer to mention rhythm in prose is [[Aristotle]] in his ''Ars Rhetorica''; he says that prose should not be entirely metrical, like poetry, but also not unrhythmical either.&lt;ref&gt;1408b; cf. Adams (2013), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero himself discusses the use of clausulae in his books on oratory, especially in ''[[de Oratore]]'' 173-198, and ''[[Orator]]'' 204-226.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 164-5; Adams (2013), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terentianus|Terentianus Maurus]] (c. 290 AD) also discusses clausulae in a work itself written in verse. He says of the cretic (– u –) that it is the best kind of foot, especially when used in penultimate position before a dactyl (– u x).&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] treats clausulae at length, especially in books 5 and 9; like Terentianus, he approves of the double cretic | – u – | – u x |,&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.107; Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; but recommends avoiding the heroic clausula | – x – | – uu – x |, since it too much resembles the end of a line of verse.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.102; Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of clausula-study==
The analysis of a piece of Latin into cola and clausulae can not only of help the modern student to read the passage with authentic phrasing, but also is a useful tool in investigating an author's style. So, for example, Riggsby notes that the cola in the earlier part of the 2nd Catilinarian oration are shorter, and the clausulae more varied, than in the last paragraph. He takes this as an indication of Cicero's shift in emphasis from chaos and danger to peace and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Riggsby (2010), pp. 101-102; cf. Adams (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the clausulae will throw light on the writer's choice of word, tense or word order.&lt;ref name=Cla171&gt;Clark (1905), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''patent portae, proficiscere!''&lt;ref&gt;''In Catilinam'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; "the gates are open; depart!" makes an effective clausula, whereas *''portae patent, proficiscere'' does not. Clausulae can also help editors decide which of two manuscript readings is the correct one, or whether an editor's conjecture is acceptable.&lt;ref name=Cla170&gt;Clark (1905), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausulae have sometimes helped editors to decide on the authenticity or otherwise of a work. For example, the speech ''de domo sua'', whose authorship was once in doubt, has been shown to exhibit exactly the same proportions of clausulae as Cicero's other speeches.&lt;ref name=Cla171 /&gt; In the case of authors whose practice varied over the years, such as Plato, clausulae analysis can throw light on the date of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From examining the clausulae it is sometimes possible to uncover the exact pronunciation of individual words by a particular author. For example, it appears that Cicero pronounced ''redduco'' "I bring back" and ''relliquus'' "remaining" with a long first syllable, as did [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; ''Nōn modō'' "not only" was pronounced with the last vowel long. For ordinary nouns ending in ''-ium'' or ''-ius'', the genitive ''-i'' was preferred by Cicero (e.g. ''iudici'' "of the trial"), although in proper names such as ''Clodii'' "of Clodius" the ending "-ii" was often used. In ''nil'' and ''nihil'' "nothing" and ''periculum'' and ''periclum'' "danger" both forms occur.&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; In the future perfect tense, as in ''fecerīmus'' "we'll have made", it appears that Cicero, contrary to the rule given in some grammars such as Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, B. ''Revised Latin Primer'', 1962 ed. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced the "i" long, as did his contemporary [[Catullus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce, C.J. (1961) ''Catullus: A commentary'', note on 5.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineering Informatics''' is an [[engineering]] discipline combining [[information technology]] (IT) – or [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] – with engineering concepts; It is an interdisciplinary scientific area focusing on the application of advanced computing, information and communication technologies to engineering; The study of use of information and the design of information structures that facilitate the practice of engineering and of designed artifacts that embody and embed information technology and science to achieve social, economic and environmental goals. Given this perspective, the rest of the introduction identifies different strands of concepts that inform and support the evolution of engineering informatics as a distinct discipline that lives at the interface between engineering and informatics, in the same vein as bioinformatics, geoinformatics, medical informatics, and other applied disciplines.

==Engineering Informatics as a discipline of field study==

Computer-aided design (CAD), intelligent CAD, engineering analysis, collaborative design support, computer-aided engineering, and product life-cycle management are some of the terms that have emerged over the past decades of computing in engineering. Codification and automation of engineering knowledge and methods have had major impact on engineering practice. The use of computers by engineers has consistently tracked advancements in computer and information sciences. Computing, algorithms, computational methods, and engineering have increasingly intertwined themselves as developments in theory and practice in both disciplines influence each other. Therefore, it is now time to begin using the term “engineering informatics” to cover the science of the information that flows through these processes.

Informatics, with origins in the German word "''Informatik''" referring to automated information processing, has evolved to its current broad definition. The rise of the term informatics can be attributed to the breadth of disciplines that are now accepted and envisioned as contributing to the field of computing and information sciences. A common definition of informatics adopted by many departments/schools of informatics comes from the University of Edinburgh: "''the study of the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems that store, process and communicate information.''” Informatics includes the science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems.

The history of engineering and computers shows a trend of increasing sophistication in the type of engineering problems being solved. Early CAD was primarily geometry driven (using mathematics and computer science). Then came the engineering use of AI, driven by theories of cognitive science and computational models of cognition (logic and pattern based). More recently, models of collaboration and representation and acquisition of collective knowledge have been introduced, driven by fields of social sciences (ethnography, sociology of work) and philosophy.

Information technology and sciences to have both created the need for, and play a role in, facilitating the management of complex [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical]] processes. Information is context specific and its engineering is an integral part of any exchange among people and machines. Thus, informatics is the process of:
# creating and codifying the linguistic worlds (representational structures) represented by the object worlds in the relevant domain, and
# managing the attendant meanings through their contexts of use and accumulation through synthesis and classification.
Engineering informatics is a reflective task beyond the software/hardware that supports engineering; it is a cross-disciplinary perspective on the nature of collective intellectual work. It thereby becomes critical that a consciousness of the use of languages and their implications in the storage and retrieval of information in a work community be addressed as part of any information engineering task.

The role informatics plays in engineering products and services has become significant in the past decades. Most of the development has happened in an ad hoc manner, as can be expected. Techniques appeared in [[computer science]] and in programming practice; these techniques get used in engineering as is. Early computing in engineering was limited due to the capacities of computers. Computational power and telecommunications systems have started to converge, resulting in the possibilities of untethered connections and exchange of information that was just a distant dream in the early computing days. These developments have made the problems of distance less onerous and allow for global design, manufacturing, and supply chains. However, the problem of managing a global supply chain still is a daunting task with numerous incompatibilities in information exchange and coordination.

The problem of integrating entire sets of industries in a flexible and ad hoc manner is still a dream especially for small-scale industries within the larger global environment. For this dream to become a reality, standards become critical. With technology evolving continuously, the task of creating information standards for varieties of exchanges from the syntactic to the semantic is a challenge yet to be resolved.

Computer scientists or engineers by themselves cannot solve engineering informatics problems or the processes required to manage information in the context of engineered systems—it has to be a collaborative effort. The lack of skills among computer scientists in engineering and engineers in computing has led to problems bridging the disciplines. What pedagogical stance can help prepare students to deal with the complexities that are inherent in the task of engineering informatics? The culture of learning has to encourage the appreciation of diversity at the same time looking for the core essence and canonical nature of the experiences. While the products of today are increasingly designed for variety, we still have not mastered this process conceptually, let alone are we preparing our students. The fundamental characteristic of engineering informatics is that it is applicable at local levels of decision making in a design process as well as at the holistic level of product management and organizational design.

Nowadays, people are entering an era of networks where different infrastructural networks can be connected through information networks. The information network can connect the manufacturing network to the design and supply chain network in almost real time using information systems that include sensors and ID tags. One’s imagination is the limit in this integrative power of information networks. It is this new complex world that we need to teach students, among other things, the ability to reflect on the information they use and how to handle this information, what it means to use (or not) computational tools, the need to create tools at different scales of inquiry and across disciplines, and how to view one’s own discipline from an engineering informatics point of view.

'''Gender Through Comic Books''' (also known as #SuperMOOC because of its popular [[hash tag]] on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SuperMOOC&amp;src=typd |title=Twitter / Search - #SuperMOOC |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[MOOC]] taught April 2, 2013 through May 18, 2013.

More than 7,000 students enrolled in the April 2013 Gender Through Comic Books course taught by Christina Blanch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christina-blanch/48/61/982 |title=Christina Blanch |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ball State University]] on the Canvas platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423235716/https://www.canvas.net/courses/gender-through-comic-books |archivedate=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanch, an anthropologist, thought that "using comic books could be a way to approach teaching gender without the trepidation some students feel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox |first=Kelly |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2013/01/gender-through-comics/ |title=New Online Course Explores Gender Through Comic Books &amp;#124; GeekMom |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when approaching the subject. Students read scholarly articles each week in addition to comics (offered as e-comics by [[Comixology]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comixology.com/mooc&lt;/ref&gt; plus participated in live interviews with comic book creators with questions submitted via Twitter. There has been some controversy over issues of gender and patriarchy related to MOOCS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiann.com/2013/05/15/guest-post-on-the-lords-of-mooc-creation-whos-really-for-change-and-who-in-fact-is-standing-athwart-history-yelling-stop/ |title=Guest post on the Lords of MOOC Creation: who’s really for change, and who in fact is standing athwart history yelling STOP? : Historiann : History and sexual politics, 1492 to the present |publisher=Historiann |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blanch's class served to break through barriers related to gender, the comics medium, and pedagogy.

The course was divided into six week-long modules and covered the topics of: ''What is gender?'', ''Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender'', ''Who is producing comic book culture?'', ''Femininity'', ''Masculinity'', and ''Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics''.&lt;ref&gt;https://learn.canvas.net/courses/23/files/21549/download?verifier=FpgcVPH5Lh0uzjpHRImwtJL4Wdun9WMJrglnCxbt&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the course content were the interviews with prominent comic book creators: [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] author of ''[[Strangers in Paradise]]''; [[Mark Waid]], writer for ''[[Superman]]''; [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]], [[Steve Wacker]], and [[Sana Amanant]], creators of the new [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]; [[Gail Simone]] author of [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]; [[Scott Snyder]] author of [[Swamp Thing]]; and [[Brian K. Vaughn]] author of [[Y: The Last Man]]. Students could put questions forth in the discussion boards for the class, or use a Twitter hashtag to tweet questions during the interviews.

== Week One: What is gender? ==
Week one was an introduction into what gender is, and how gender differs from sex. Readings for this week included Strangers in Paradise, volumes 1 and 2, and the first issue of Rachel Rising, all by writer/artist Terry Moore. The week's interview was with Moore, as well. Additional reading for the introduction to gender was the article "Night to His Day": The Social Construction of Gender by Judith Lorber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tannerhiggin.com/summer11eng1c/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/social_constructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Two: Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender ==
Week two discussed how gender is learned. Blanch interviewed Mark Waid, and the comic book selections were Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of Superman) and #267, and Waid's Birthright series. Additionally, the article "Doing Gender" by Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.lib.umn.edu/clar0514/academic/west%20and%20zimmerman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned.

== Week Three: Who is producing comic book culture? ==
Week three dealt with comic books as a medium of communication. The interview included Kelly Sue DeConnick, Sana Ammant and Steve Wacker and their roles as writers and editors. The assigned comics were Captain Marvel #1-7, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 1, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 2, and Daredevil #1. The article "How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=laichas |url=http://www.impact-books.com/comics/how-comic-books-are-made-from-idea-to-print |title=How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print |publisher=IMPACT Books |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the supplemental reading.

== Week Four: Femininity ==
Week four discussed femininity, and the readings included Secret Six (vol. 2) 1-7, Wonder Woman #1, Wonder Woman (New 52) #7, Birds of Prey #56, and Batgirl #0. The interview was with Gail Simone. (Due to technical difficulties, this was a recorded interview, not live as the others were.) The article "Spice World: Constructing Femininity the Popular Way" by Dafna Lemish&lt;ref&gt;http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/syllabi/spring%202005/com%20507/spicegirls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

== Week Five: Masculinity ==
Week five discussed masculinity, and the comics assigned were both from the New 52: Batman #0 and Swamp Thing #0. The interview was with Scott Snyder. Additional reading was "Comic Book Masculinity and the New Black Superhero" by Jeffrey A. Brown&lt;ref&gt;http://lmc.gatech.edu/~hcarroll/courses/e1102-sp04/e1102-scans/secondary-sources/brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Week Six: Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics ==
The final week discussed how different spaces can be gendered, and differences in how comics are consumed. The readings were from Y: The Last Man (#1-6) and Saga #1, and the interview was with Brian K. Vaughan. The article "Gendered Spaces: Gym Culture and the Construction of Gender" by Thomas Johansson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |title=T Johansson/JA |publisher=Logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102191747/http://logic.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/~b114299/young/1996-3/artikkelJohansson3-96.htm |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also assigned.

The student interaction in the message boards added to the discussions. Since the students were not in a classroom, this was the way they could share ideas and questions, and challenge others to see things from another point of view. Because the class was also global, the students brought with them their own cultural differences, which also added to the discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Genetic exceptionalism''' is the belief that genetic information is special and so must be treated differently from other types of medical data or other personally identifiable information.  

For example, patients are able to obtain information about their [[blood pressure]] without involving any medical professionals, but to obtain information about their genetic profile might require an order from a physician and expensive counseling sessions. Disclosure of an individual's genetic information or its meaning, such as telling a woman with red hair that she has a higher risk of skin cancer, has been legally restricted in some places, as providing [[medical advice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Turna. 18 August 2010.  [http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/uc-berkeley-halts-genetic-testing-program-touts-opportunity-ethical-debate UC Berkeley Halts Genetic Testing Program, but Touts Opportunity for Ethical Debate] ''Pharmacogenomics Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

That policy approach has been taken by state legislatures to safeguard individuals' genetic information in the [[United States]] from individuals, their families, their employers, and the government. The approach builds upon the existing protection required of general health information provided by such laws as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].

== Expert Debate ==

There is ongoing debate over whether or when certain genetic information should be considered exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James P|last2=Burke|first2=Wylie|date=July 2008|title=Genetic exceptionalism. Too much of a good thing?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1097/GIM.0b013e31817f280a|journal=Genetics in Medicine|language=En|volume=10|issue=7|pages=500–501|doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31817f280a|issn=1098-3600}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the predictive power of genetic information (such as a risk for a disease like [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]], which is highly penetrant) may justify special considerations for genetic exceptionalism, in that individuals with a high risk for developing this condition may face a certain amount of discrimination. However, for most common human health conditions, a specific genetic variant only plays a partial role, interacting with other genetic variants and environmental and lifestyle influences to contribute to disease development. In these cases, genetic information is often considered similarly to other medical and lifestyle data, such as smoking status, age, or [[Biomarker|biomarkers]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kennet Tickell.jpeg|thumb|left|Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet with Sir Crispin Tickell and Oliver Tickell at Oxford University]] --&gt;
As defined by the Green Economics Institute, green economics is "Progressive Economics, reclaiming economics for all people everywhere - women, nature, other species, the planet and its systems".&lt;ref name="greeneconomics.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=6conf&gt;[http://www.gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf Green Economics Institute: 6th Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023853/http://gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inderscience.com/www/conf/2012jul_ijge_growth_rio_uk_110.pdf Green Economics Institute Seventh Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Economics Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet describes green economics as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Green Economics is the green movement's challenge to mainstream orthodoxy in economics and it is gaining ground globally and in the corridors of power as the best alternative to solving climate change, the credit crunch, poverty and biodiversity losses. It is about providing reclaiming the practices and policies of economics, for all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet and its systems. It is about provisioning for the needs, impacts, effects and responsibilities, for everyone and everything on the planet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Founders==
[[File:GEIWorkshop.jpg|thumb|right|An interactive Green Economics workshop in Petersfield, July 2011]]

The Green Economics Institute was founded by Miriam Kennet and Volker Heinemann in 2004.

'''Miriam Kennet''', co-founder, director and CEO, received an MAIB in Economics and International Business from [[South Bank University]], and most recently an MSC in Environmental Science and Economics from the [[University of Oxford]]. She has researched into environmental economics at [[South Bank University]], Oxford University, and [[Keele University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micandidate.eu/candidate.aspx?idcandidate=2705 ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/page34.html |title=Miriam Kennet |publisher=Green Economics |date= |accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volker Heinemann''', co-founder and director of the Institute, holds a master's degree in Economics. He is a former German Green Councillor and is currently an associate editor of the ''[[International Journal of Green Economics]]''&lt;ref&gt; www.inderscience.com/jge&lt;/ref&gt; He is author of ''Die Oekonomie der Zukunft'', a book that investigates future economic trends in the developed world. It is based on the idea that a new economic science, free from any neo-liberal or other normative bias is needed: green economics.&lt;ref name="greeneconomics5"/&gt;

'''Michelle Gale (USA)''' is our current Non Executive Director and has been in post for 10 years.
She heads up our COP UNFCC Climate Delegations Diplomacy and also is the co -author and editor of many  of our books. She is a specialist in International Relations, and Economics and Human Rights Law and gender issues.

'''Professor Maria Madi''' (Brazil) heads up our academic work at the www.geiacademy.org. &lt;ref&gt; www.geiacademy.org &lt;/ref&gt;. She is a specialist and Professor of international finance.

'''The Green Economics Institute Trust'''
The Green Economics Institute Trust, greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org, is a Registered Charity No 111768 (Ref: The Charities Commission) which was founded in 2009 by Judith Felton with founding trustees, Jacob Sanders, Miriam Kennet, Volker Heinemann and others.
Its board of trustees is very active and holds regular Exhibition Stands roughly one a month around Europe to advise people what they can do to implement our research and ideas. The Charity  spreads its ideas by educating the public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice, in particular it shared the  offices with '''Launchpad''' a charity for the homeless, and also with the '''Ethical Property Company'''.

'''Social Justice'''
It has supported the  publication of numerous books on aspects of social justice, for Example The Philosophy of Social Justice which was very popular at the Paris UNFCC COP21 Climate Conference showing the link between social justice, diversity and solving climate change issues. It also publishes regularly on climate change and supports the publication of books on the green economy.

'''Changing the Narrative of Migration''' 
The Trust has also been active in the migration debate- promoting the idea of '''Changing the Narrative of Migration''' with 4 conferences on the subject and academic papers and a book '''{{ISBN|9781907543210}}'''&lt;ref&gt; {{ISBN|9781907543210}} &lt;/ref&gt; discussing other ways of looking at migration and its true history, believing that xenophobia and intolerance are contrary to the introduction of a green economy. More information about the Green Economics Institute Trust can be found at its website www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org 
&lt;ref&gt;www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Its email is &lt;ref&gt; info@greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org&lt;/ref&gt; greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org.

'''Mental Health and Sustainability'''
The Trust is also very active in promoting mental health as a very important factor in understanding the human difficulty in changing track and stopping runnaway climate change, pollution and a range of difficult subjects. It works with a range of top pyschiatrists and many of them inform the profession and government on this issue. We have also published a book on Health, ''The Greening of Health and Healthcare, which has been very influential not least being used by  Chinese government official when planning the next phase of health developments in China.
''
'''Law: Whose Law is it anyway?''' 
The Trust is very active in philosophy and the law internationally, working with many partner lawyers. It is currently engaged in a round of lectures, talking about how many of the worlds worst ever atrocities have been committed under the cover of the ruling laws or governments so that victims have no recourse to law whilst this has taken place. We are advising people to consider, who is the law for and who does it protect, and who has access to it. It is necessary to sort this out if we are considering the role of the commons, and the rights of ordinary people to access ordinary resources, water for example, so ''Whose Law is it anyway?'' is a major project developing at the institute led by '''Maria Fernanda Madi''' (Brazil and the Netherlands).

'''Diversity'''
The Trust has always promoted diversity in all its activities, publications and events, as well as acting as a beacon for others. It is currently advising several other Institutions on how to achieve and maintain real diversity in organisations as a means of ensuring social and environmental justice.

''''''Chair of Trustees'''''' is Marlyn Lee - Hughes, more information can be found at:  greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org. She is a specialist in both science, trained at Edinburgh and a lecturer in English. Mrs Hughes runs our Registered Charity The Green Economics Institute Trust and its work in 
'''Educating the Public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice.''

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GEICollage.jpg|thumb|left|A collage depicting Green Economics conferences and awards ceremonies]] --&gt;
The Green Economics Institute's Green Economics Research is focused on three key aspects:&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The reform of mainstream [[economics]] by means of robust research into alternatives and existing theories, and how these can be made more relevant and practical.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The creation and development of the new "Greening the Economy" discourse of [[Green economy|green economics]].&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# Research into policy formulation and implementation which would provide economics with the philosophy, methodology, ontology and instruments to bring social and environmental justice.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;

''''''Research Activity and Website''''''

An '''[[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] audio effects controller''' is an electronic device that senses changes in acceleration, angular velocity and/or a magnetic field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://howtomechatronics.com/how-it-works/electrical-engineering/mems-accelerometer-gyrocope-magnetometer-arduino/|title=MEMS Accelerometer Gyroscope Magnetometer &amp; Arduino|date=2015-11-19|work=HowToMechatronics|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relays those changes to an effects controller. Transmitting the sensed data can be done via wired or wireless methods. To be of use the effects controller must be connected to an [[Effects unit|effect unit]] so that an effect can be modulated, or connected to a [[MIDI controller]] or [[musical keyboard]]. The [[Wah-wah pedal|Wah-Wah]] effect is a classic example of effect modulation.

An inertial audio effects controller can be compared with a traditional [[expression pedal]] to explain what it does. An inertial effects controller uses an inertial sensor to detect user directed changes, whereas a traditional expression pedal uses an electrically resistive element to detect changes.There are some advantages and disadvantages between the two. The main advantages of inertial control versus a traditional foot pedal, are an increased range of dynamic motion, remote control, finer modulation precision and software enabled features such as motion triggered [[ADSR envelope]]s and bi-directional motion control. The main disadvantages are the requirement for a power source and a more complicated setup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressionpedals.com/inertial-expression&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their functional similarity with traditional expression pedals, they have been given the informal name, 'Expression box'.

==Availability==

Conceivably any or all of the inertial sensors ([[Accelerometer|accelerometer,]] [[gyroscope]], [[magnetometer]]), could be used for effect modulation. However, currently the only commercially available products use acceleration sensing only&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehx.com/products/expression-pedal|title=EHX.com {{!}} Expression Pedal - Real-Time Variable Control {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=Electro-Harmonix|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sourceaudio.net/products/hothand/hothand3.php|title=Hot Hand® 3|website=www.sourceaudio.net|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or acceleration combined with angular velocity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozinventions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, as sensed by a gyroscope.

==Future==

Inertial control of an audio device, wired or wireless, is a relatively recent and growing trend as technology advances have reduced pricing and size as well as improved usability and performance of the core components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronicproducts.com/Software/EDA_Software_and_Hardware/Thinking_outside_the_chip_for_MEMS_design_success.aspx|title=Thinking outside the chip for MEMS design success - Electronic Products|website=www.electronicproducts.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutmems.com/memsapplications-wireless.html|title=allaboutmems.com - What is MEMS &gt; MEMS Applications &gt; MEMS in Wireless|website=www.allaboutmems.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the core components are an inertial device called a Mirco- Electro-Mechanical-System ([[MEMs]]), a [[microcontroller]], and for wireless systems, a [[Transmitter|radio frequency transmitter]]/receiver.

==History==
IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

The '''International Social Science Council''' ('''ISSC''') was an international organisation promoting the [[social sciences|social sciences, including the economic and behavioural sciences]].  It was founded in 1952, under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. 6-9 Oct 1952, Paris (France), following a Resolution at the 6th UNESCO General Conference in 1951. Statutes: adopted 19 Sep 1972; completed and revised 14 Nov 1979; revised: 17 Dec 1985; 3 Dec 1992; 27 Nov 1998; 8 Nov 2006; 10 Dec 2010. Registered in accordance with French Law.

In 2018 the ISSC merged with the [[International Council for Science|International Council for Science (ICSU)]] to create the [[International Science Council]].

==Mission==
The mission of the ISSC was to advance the social sciences - their quality, novelty and utility - in all parts of the world: 
* To advance social science research across national and regional boundaries; 
* To support social science capacity building, particularly in countries and regions where it is currently not well developed; 
* To provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis and dissemination of data on social science resources, their availability for research and their impact on society; * To broaden interdisciplinary collaboration among the social sciences; 
* To expand exchange and joint work between the social sciences, the humanities and other sciences; * To link social science knowledge effectively to public policies and local needs in order to improve the quality of people's lives; 
* To promote the social science literacy of citizens.

The activities of the Council were guided by the principles of academic freedom, pursuit of excellence, equitable access to scientific information and data, unfettered conduct of science, open communication and transparency, accountability, and the use of knowledge for societal value. In addition, the Council sought to support the participation of women, minorities and others under-represented in social science research.

==Governance and structure==
The ISSC was governed by a General Assembly, comprising the Council’s membership. The General Assembly met every three years to review the Council’s activities and determine the general direction of its future work.

The ISSC Executive Committee was elected by the General Assembly and acted as the Council’s governing body. It consisted of the President, two Vice-Presidents and a Treasurer, as well as ten further members (Ordinary Members). 

The General Assembly, on recommendation of the Executive Committee, approved the appointment of the Executive Director, who headed the Council’s Secretariat, and served as an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee and of all appointed (standing or ad hoc) committees of the ISSC.

The Council was advised and guided by individuals from around the world who volunteered their time to serve on various ISSC Committees and Working Groups.

==Activities==
The ISSC led a number of flagship activities and was a partner on many collaborative initiatives.

===World Social Science Report===
The ISSC produced the World Social Science Report every three years, as part of its strategic partnership with [[UNESCO]]. The reports aim to address important social science challenges, take stock of social science contributions and capacities, and to make recommendations for future research, practice and policy.

* The World Social Science Report 2010: Knowledge Divides was prepared by the ISSC and published by UNESCO in June 2010. It reviewed social science knowledge production and use in different regions of the world and assessed how the social sciences are evolving in the face of unequal conditions and diverging trends.
* The World Social Science Report 2013: Changing Global Environments was prepared by the ISSC and co-published with UNESCO and the [[OECD]]. It was launched at UNESCO in Paris in November 2013.
* The World Social Science Report 2016: Challenging Inequalities – Pathways to a Just World was prepared by the ISSC in collaboration with the [[Institute of Development Studies|Institute of Development Studies (IDS)]], and co-published with UNESCO. It was launched in Stockholm on September 22 2016.

===World Social Science Forum===
The ISSC convened the World Social Science Forum. These events gather researchers, funders, policymakers, and other stakeholders to debate topics of global significance and to determine future priorities for international social science. 

* The ISSC convened the first ever World Social Science Forum in Bergen, Norway, 10-12 May 2009, on the topic 'One planet - worlds apart?'
* The second World Social Science Forum, 'Social Transformations and the Digital Age', took place in Montreal, Canada, in October 2013.
* The third World Social Science Forum, 'Transforming Global Relations for a Just World', took place in Durban, South Africa, 13-16 September 2015.
* The fourth World Social Science Forum will take place in Fukuoka, Japan, in September 2018. The theme is 'Security and Equality for Sustainable Futures'.

===Transformations to Sustainability===
Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a research programme supporting social-science-led research on social transformations to greater sustainability. The programme is funded by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)]] and has supported 38 seed projects (September 2014 to March 2015) and three Transformative Knowledge Networks (December 2015 to December 2018). The programme aims to build on the networks of knowledge gathered through the seed projects and Transformative Knowledge Networks to create and leave behind a lasting global knowledge base. 

The Transformations to Sustainability programme contributes to [[Future Earth]].

===Programmes and networks===
The ISSC initiated and supported several international research programmes with the objective of fostering comparative, interdisciplinary research by setting up networks of social scientists from different disciplines and regions of the world.The ISSC co-sponsored a number of international research programmes and networks around various themes, such as the environment, disaster risk, poverty and gender. These initiatives were undertaken in partnership with various partners and other organisations around the world.

* [[Future Earth]]
* [[International Human Dimensions Programme]]
* [http://www.irdrinternational.org/ Integrated Research on Disaster Risk]
* [http://www.csun.edu/~isscggd/ Gender, Globalisation and Democratisation Network]

===Prizes===
The ISSC awarded two prestigious international prizes: the [[Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research]] and the Foundation Mattei Dogan Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Research.

Nominations for the prize were made by ISSC members or other professional associations in various disciplines, as well as by universities and academic institutions. The selection of a winner is made by an international jury of scholars.

===World Social Science Fellows===
From 2012 to 2015 the ISSC led the World Social Science Fellows programme, an international scientific programme to support early-career researchers in the social sciences, with the aim of fostering a new generation of globally-networked research leaders who will collaborate in addressing global problems with particular relevance for low and middle income countries.

The '''International Year of Biodiversity''' ('''IYB''') was a year-long celebration of [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] and its importance, taking place internationally in 2010. Coinciding with the date of the [[2010 Biodiversity Target]], the year was declared by the 61st session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2006.

It was meant to help raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity through activities and events, to influence decision makers, and "to elevate biological diversity nearer to the top of the political agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, David (2009). The International Year of Biodiversity–From Talk to Action. ''Conservation Biology'' 24 (1): 338–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The United Nations General Assembly declared 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity (Resolution 61/203). This year coincided with the 2010 Biodiversity Target adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and by Heads of State and government at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Marton-Lefèvre, Julia (2010). Biodiversity is our life. ''Science'' 313: 1179. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/327/5970/1179 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), based in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], was coordinating the International Year of Biodiversity campaign.

Established at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity. The CBD has near-universal participation, with 193 Parties.

==Main goals in UN view==
The main goals of the International Year of Biodiversity were to:
* Enhance public awareness of the importance of conserving biodiversity and of the underlying threats to biodiversity
* Raise awareness of the accomplishments to save biodiversity that had been realized by communities and governments
* Promote innovative solutions to reduce the threats to biodiversity
* Encourage individuals, organizations and governments to act immediately to halt [[biodiversity loss]]
* Start dialog between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] for what to do in the post-2010 period

===Slogan===
::: '' Biodiversity is love. Biodiversity is life.''

Known species of bacteria with [[microbial metabolism]]s based on iron oxidation include ''[[Thiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]''.

==Habitat==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria colonize the transition zone where de-oxygenated water from an [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] environment flows into an aerobic environment.  Groundwater containing dissolved organic material may be de-oxygenated by [[microorganisms]] feeding on that dissolved organic material.  Where concentrations of organic material exceed the concentration of dissolved oxygen required for complete oxidation, microbial populations that contain [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|iron-reducing bacteria]] can reduce insoluble ferric oxide in [[aquifer]] [[soils]] to soluble ferrous hydroxide and use the oxygen released by that change to oxidize some of the remaining organic material:&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} pp.446-447&lt;/ref&gt;

::4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
::(water) + (Iron[III] oxide) → (Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen)

When the de-oxygenated water reaches a source of oxygen, iron-oxidizing bacteria use that oxygen to convert the soluble ferrous iron back into an insoluble reddish precipitate of ferric iron:&lt;ref&gt;Snoeyink, Vernon L. and Jenkins, David "Water Chemistry" John Wiley &amp; Sons (1980) {{ISBN|0-471-05196-9}} pp.380-381&lt;/ref&gt;

::4Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
::(Iron[II] hydroxide) + (oxygen) → (water) + (Iron[III] oxide)

Since the latter reaction is the normal equilibrium in our oxygen atmosphere while the first requires biological coupling with a simultaneous oxidation of carbon, organic material dissolved in water is often the underlying cause of iron-metabolizing bacteria populations.  Groundwater may be naturally de-oxygenated by decaying vegetation in [[swamp]]s; and useful mineral deposits of [[bog iron]] ore have formed where that groundwater has historically emerged to be exposed to atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.213&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthropogenic hazard|Anthropogenic]] sources like [[landfill]] [[leachate]], [[septic drain field]]s, or leakage of light [[petroleum]] fuels like [[gasoline]] are other possible sources of organic materials allowing soil [[microbes]] to de-oxygenate groundwater.

A similar reversible reaction may form black deposits of [[manganese dioxide]] from dissolved [[manganese]], but is less common because of the relative abundance of iron (5.4 percent) in comparison to manganese (0.1 percent) in average soils.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, Konrad B. "Introduction to Geochemistry" McGraw-Hill (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-035447-2}} p.544&lt;/ref&gt;  Other conditions associated with iron-oxidizing bacteria result from the anaerobic aqueous environment rather than the bacteria visibly colonizing that habitat.  [[Corrosion]] of pipes is another source of soluble iron for the first reaction above and the sulfurous smell of rot or decay results from enzymatic conversion of soil [[sulfate]]s to volatile [[hydrogen sulfide]] as an alternative source of oxygen in anaerobic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. and McCarty, Perry L. "Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers" McGraw-Hill (1967) {{ISBN|0-07-054970-2}} p.459&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on water infrastructure ==

Iron-oxidizing bacteria can pose an issue for the management of [[water supply|water-supply]] [[water well|well]]s, as they can produce insoluble [[ferric oxide]], which appears as brown gelatinous slime that will stain plumbing fixtures, and clothing or utensils washed with the water carrying it. 

===Possible indicators===


[[Image:Iron bacteria burn.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Burn (landform)|burn]] in Scotland with iron-oxidizing bacteria.]]
The dramatic effects of iron bacteria are seen in surface waters as brown slimy masses on stream bottoms and lakeshores or as an oily sheen upon the water. More serious problems occur when bacteria build up in well systems.  Iron bacteria in wells do not cause health problems, but they can reduce well yields by clogging screens and pipes.

===Control===

Treatment techniques which may be successful in removing or reducing iron bacteria include physical removal, pasteurization, and chemical treatment. Treatment of heavily infected wells may be difficult, expensive, and only partially successful.

Physical removal is typically done as a first step. Small diameter pipes are sometimes cleaned with a wire brush, while larger lines can be scrubbed and flushed clean with a [[Drain cleaner#Sewer jetters|sewer jetter]]. The pumping equipment in the well must also be removed and cleaned. 

Iron filters have been used to treat iron bacteria. Iron filters are similar in appearance and size to conventional water softeners but contain beds of media which have mild oxidizing power. As the iron-bearing water is passed through the bed, any soluble ferrous iron is converted to the insoluble ferric state and then filtered from the water. Any previously precipitated iron is removed by simple mechanical filtration. Several different filter media may be used in these iron filters, including manganese greensand, Birm, MTM, multi-media, sand, and other synthetic materials. In most cases, the higher oxides of manganese produce the desired oxidizing action. Iron filters do have limitations. Since the oxidizing action is relatively mild, it will not work well when organic matter, either combined with the iron or completely separate, is present in the water and iron bacteria will not be killed. Extremely high iron concentrations may require inconvenient frequent backwashing and/or regeneration. Finally, iron filter media requires high flow rates for proper backwashing and such water flows are not always available.

Wildfires may release iron-containing compounds from the soil into small wildland streams and cause a rapid but usually temporary proliferation of iron-oxidizing bacteria complete with orange coloration, the gelatinous mats, and sulphurous odors. Higher quality personal filters typically used in backpacking/trekking can successfully remove bacteria, odor, and restore water clarity.

'''Johann Peter Kirsch''' (November 3, 1861 – February 4, 1941) was a [[Luxembourg|Luxembourgish]] [[ecclesiastical history|ecclesiastical historian]] and [[biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologist]].

==Life==
Johann Peter Kirsch was born in Dippach, Luxembourg on November 3, 1861, the son of Andreas and Katherine Didier Kirsch. He began his high school education at the Atheneum, and then went to the seminary.&lt;ref name=cem&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oZQuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=johann+peter+kirsch+1861&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wVHiRQFkJC&amp;sig=WD_IzF5u1g5r6_MUfBZS1ubP2CA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n0ntVNKxM4WfggTFmYSoCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=johann%20peter%20kirsch%201861&amp;f=false "Kirsch, Right Reverend Monsignor Johann", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers'', 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained a priest on August 23, 1884. That autumn he was sent to Rome to attend the Collegio Teutonico. Kirsch was a student of renowned archaeologist [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]].&lt;ref name=enit/&gt;

In 1888 Kirsch became the first Director of the Historical Institute of the Görres Society in Rome. From 1889 to 1932 he was professor of [[patristics]] and biblical archaeology at the [[University of Fribourg]],&lt;ref name=enit&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/johann-peter-kirsch/&amp;prev=search "Kirsch, Johann Peter", ''L'Encyclopedia Italiana]&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] was one of his students.

In 1932, Kirsch was made a [[prothonotary apostolic]].

Monsignor Kirsch contributed many articles to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''. He died in Rome on February 4, 1941, and is buried at the Campo Santo Teutonico.

'''Lesbian sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[women who have sex with women]], regardless of their [[sexual orientation]]. A woman who has sex with another woman may identify as a [[lesbian]] if she is exclusively sexually attracted to women, or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] if she is not exclusively sexually attracted to women, or dispense with [[sexual identification]] altogether. The term may also be applied to a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[asexuality|asexual]] woman who is unsure of or is exploring her sexuality.

[[Romance (love)|Romantic]] or sexual [[interpersonal relationship]]s are often subject to [[sexual desire]] and [[sexual arousal|arousal]], which then leads to sexual activity for sexual release. A physical expression of intimacy between women depends on the context of the relationship along with social, cultural and other influences.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hite Reports: What do they say?|publisher=hite-research.com|date= |accessdate=November 19, 2011|url=http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm|archivedate=June 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601230726/http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviors==

===General===
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation.png|thumb|A woman [[stimulation of nipples|orally stimulating the nipples]] of her sexual partner]]
Commonly, women engage in displays of affection, such as kissing on the cheek or hugging. A kiss on the lips, a prolonged kiss or hug, or other forms of touching, may or may not be regarded as [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. [[Sex educator]] and [[feminist]] [[Shere Hite]] stated that one of her female research subjects had written, "Sex with a woman includes: touching, kissing, smiling, looking serious, embracing, talking, digital intercourse, caressing, looking, cunnilingus, undressing, remembering later, making sounds, sometimes gently biting, sometimes crying, and breathing and sighing together."&lt;ref name="Hite/lesbianism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbianism: Women's Sexual Expression Together|publisher=hite-research.com|date=|accessdate=February 3, 2012|url=http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html|archivedate=October 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017143602/http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disrobing before a partner, removing the clothing of a partner or performing acts of [[physical intimacy]], such as the touching of a partner's [[erogenous zone]]s by the use of hands, tongue or rest of the mouth, may be regarded as indicators of the partner's desire for sexual activity and an [[erotic stimuli]] or turn-on (sexual arousal), which may generate erotic sensations in both partners. Allowing such acts of physical intimacy, especially the stimulation of a partner's breasts and nipples, is an indication of  reciprocal interest in sexual activity.

A woman's mouth, lips and tongue may be sensitive erogenous zones; they are commonly used by partners during the preliminary stages and throughout a sexual activity, whether for kissing, sucking, licking or specifically for [[oral sex]]. The stimulation of a partner's breasts, including [[Stimulation of nipples|oral or manual stimulation of the nipples]], is a form of [[foreplay]]. Breast and nipple stimulation of women is a common aspect of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J.

Besides creating maternal feelings in a woman, it also decreases her [[anxiety]] and increases bonding and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716623_4| title=Physiologic Mechanism of Nipple Stimulation |publisher=Medscape Today from WebMD |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19482229"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lee HJ, Macbeth AH, Pagani JH, Young WS |title=Oxytocin: the Great Facilitator of Life |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=127–51 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482229 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.001 |pmc=2689929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[orgasm]] includes involuntary actions, including muscular [[spasm]]s in multiple areas of the body, a general [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] sensation and, frequently, body movements and [[Manner of articulation|vocalization]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2012|pages=133–135| isbn = 0618755713|accessdate=May 12, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XiqoUOWGDcfcqQHFpIDIAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period after orgasm, known as a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]], is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the [[neurohormone]]s oxytocin and prolactin.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year= 2010|page=336|accessdate =May 12, 2014| isbn = 1429237198|url = https://books.google.com/?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=Women+do+experience+a+refractory+period#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author1=Daniel L.

Oral stimulation of the [[clitoris]] or other parts of [[vulva]] or the [[vagina]] is commonly practiced between women and, like oral stimulation of the nipples, can include the use of teeth in addition to use of the lips or tongue.&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book|title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn = 0-495-60274-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2009|page=272|accessdate=2010-12-19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | author =Janell L.

[[Fingering (sexual act)|Fingering]] (manual stimulation) involves the use of the fingers to massage a woman's clitoris or other parts of the vulva, the vagina, or anus.

===Dominance, submission and BDSM===

On occasion, for variety, or on a more regular or routine basis, a woman may assume a passive role during sexual activity and leave it to her partner to provide their sexual satisfaction, which can also be an aspect of [[dominance and submission]]. For example, a person in a doggy style position may be passive and open to a variety of sex acts, generally at the choice of the active partner, such as fingering from behind, massage or stimulation of erogenous zones, including the genitals, nipples, or buttocks, and receiving a [[erotic spanking|playful spank]] to the buttocks.&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, "The Little Book of Sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The active partner can also introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], into the vagina or anus.

To ensure passivity and to enhance the feeling of or actual [[female submission]], a partner may also take part in [[sexual bondage|bondage]] (such as handcuffs) or in other [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt; During sexual bondage, the restrained partner is generally open to a variety of sex acts and cannot interfere in the ensuing sexual activity. She is dependent for her sexual satisfaction on the actions of her partner, who can choose the type and pace of the sexual activity and can introduce sex toys. For example, a [[pecker gag]] can be used to [[gag (BDSM)|gag]] the restrained partner as well as to require her to suck during sexual activity in a similar manner to an [[adult pacifier]]. The active partner has the role of treating the restrained partner as a [[sex object]] to be used for her own sexual satisfaction. The active partner may herself derive sexual satisfaction from providing her sex partner with sexual satisfaction and bringing her to orgasm.

==Research and views==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|Late 19th-century painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] showing the use of a strap-on dildo]]
In 1953, [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' documented that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|page=386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423|author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S. Dunn |author3=Elizabeth Yost Hammer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, studies by several scholars, including [[Masters and Johnson]], concluded that lesbian sexual behaviors more often have qualities associated with sexual satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts, or that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"&gt;Iasenza, S. [http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/2001/11/09/1173.the-big-lie-lesbian-bed-death ''The Big Lie: Lesbian Bed Death''], [[Fridae]] newsletter (November 9, 2001). Retrieved on June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Masters and Johnson's 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices concluded that lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact, rather than genital-focused contact, less preoccupation or anxiety about achieving orgasm, more sexual assertiveness and communication about sexual needs, [[Human sexual response cycle|longer lasting sexual encounters]] and greater satisfaction with the overall quality of one's sexual life.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;

Studies by [[Pepper Schwartz]] and Philip Blumstein (1983) and Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009) contradict research indicating that women in same-sex relationships are more sexually satisfied than their heterosexual counterparts. Schwartz concluded that lesbian couples in committed relationships have less sex than any other type of couple, and that they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts, though this study has been subject to debate (see [[Lesbian bed death]]).&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iasenza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCroy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Winnie|last=McCroy|title=The Myth of Lesbian Bed Death|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/myth-of-lesbian-bed-death/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowling"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: Lesbian Bed Death Is A Big, Fat Myth |date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]''|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-girl-on-girl-i-think-lesbian-bed-death-is-a-big-fat-myth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmberg and Blair's study, on the other hand, published in ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]]'', found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv |title=Sexual Desire, Communication, Satisfaction, and Preferences of Men and Women in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationships |first1=Diane |last1=Holmberg |first2=Karen Lyndsay |last2=Blair |pages=57–66 |doi=10.1080/00224490802645294 |issn=1559-8519 |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] |format=PDF |url=http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&amp;%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021062010/http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20%26%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research by Blair &amp; Pukall (2014) reported similar findings, such that women in same-sex relationships reported similar levels of overall sexual satisfaction and lower levels of sexual frequency. However, this recent study also reported that women in same-sex relationships spent significantly longer amounts of time on individual sexual encounters - often spending upwards of two hours on an individual encounter. Consequently, what lesbians may lack in frequency, they may make up for with longer durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|title=Can Less Be More?

With regard to the ease or difficulty of achieving orgasm, Hite's research (while subject to methodological limitations) showed that most women need clitoral (exterior) stimulation for orgasm, which can be "easy and strong, given the right stimulation" and that the need for clitoral stimulation in addition to knowing one's own body is the reason that most women reach orgasm more easily by masturbation.&lt;ref name="Hite reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hite Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|authorlink=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2004|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=1-58322-569-2|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicating Kinsey's findings, studies by scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) indicate that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;

Preferences for specific sexual practices among female same-sex relationships have also been studied. Masters and Johnson concluded that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare and lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Concerning oral sex, the common belief that all women who have sex with women engage in cunnilingus contrasts research on the subject. Some lesbian or bisexual women dislike oral sex because they do not like the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=|accessdate=June 3, 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

There are also lesbians who may or may not like [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kat Harding|title=The Lesbian Kama Sutra|isbn = 0-312-33585-7|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006 |page=31|accessdate=2011-02-03|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m5RkdiYYMBMC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last 10 sexual encounters, 100% reported kissing, sucking on breasts, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism. Lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jacqueline N.|last2=Byers|first2=E.

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women (WSW) from a community sample; the study reported that the most commonly cited sexual practices between women "were oral sex, digital vaginal penetration, mutual masturbation, and tribadism (frottage with genital-to-genital contact or rubbing of the genitals against another part of the partner's body), each of which occurred in 85% of [women who have sex with women]".

==Health risks==

Like most sexual activity, lesbian sexual activities can carry risks of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), such as [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]] or other [[pathogen]]ic infections. When lesbian sexual activity is of a non-penetrative nature, the risk of exchange of [[bodily fluid]]s is generally lower and therefore the incidence of transmission of sexually transmitted infections is also relatively low,&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn =0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Alexander|author2= Helaine Bader|author3= Judith H.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) did not recognize female-to-female transmission as a possible method of HIV infection until 1995. The CDC reported there is little data available regarding the risk of spreading sexually transmitted infections between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; However, the CDC states that pathogens such as metronidazole-resistant [[trichomoniasis]], genotype-concordant HIV, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV, which has been linked to nearly all cases of [[cervical cancer]]) and [[syphilis]] can be spread through sexual contact between women.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; While the rates of these pathologies are unknown, one study showed 30% of lesbians and bisexual women had medical histories with sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee R |title=Health care problems of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients |journal=West.

Health Canada noted "the prevalence of all types of HPV (cancer and non-cancer-causing) in different groups of Canadian women ranges from 20%–33%" and an American university study found 60% of sexually active females were infected with HPV at some time within a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genuis|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Genuis|first2=Shelagh K.|title=Managing the sexually transmitted disease pandemic: A time for reevaluation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=191|issue=4|pages=1103–1112|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Family Physician]]'' suggests that lesbian and bisexual women "cover sex toys that penetrate more than one person's vagina or anus with a new condom for each person" and to "consider using different toys for each person", to use a [[Barrier contraception|protection barrier]] (for example, a latex sheet, [[dental dam]], cut-open condom or, plastic wrap) during oral sex and to "use latex or vinyl gloves and lubricant for any manual sex that might cause bleeding unprotected contact with a sexual partner's menstrual blood and with any visible genital lesions".&lt;ref name="Mravack"/&gt; However, there "is no good evidence" that using a dental dam reduces STI transmission risks between women who have sex with women; studies show that using a dental dam as a protection barrier is rarely practiced, and that, among women who have sex with women, this may be because the individuals have "limited knowledge about the possibilities of STI transmission or [feel] less vulnerable to STIs [such as HIV]".&lt;ref name=" Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"/&gt;

'''Meister Cody''' is an [[Online game|online training game]] with an integrated diagnostic screening test for children with [[dyscalculia]] and math weakness, the [[CODY Assessment]]. It was developed as a part of the CODY Project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY Project. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration with psychologists and neuroscientists at the [[University of Münster]], and technology experts at ''Kaasa health'' (an [[mHealth]] tech company based in [[Düsseldorf]]). The [[educational video game]] is used by parents, teachers and therapists as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The scientific research at the [[University of Münster]] drove the development of the computer-based training software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/CODY/training.html ''CODY-Training'' Website of the University of Münster. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Before the training begins, children take the [[CODY Assessment]], a voluntary screening test that detects four dyscalculia relevant aspects: core markers (Dot Enumeration (DE), Magnitude Comparison (MCS, MCM)), number processing skills, calculation skills, and working memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/test-and-training/ ''Meister Cody Test'' Link to test and training page. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T./ Holling, H.: ''Number sense or working memory? The effect of two computer-based trainings on mathematical skills in elementary school.''  In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 2014, vol. 10(2), pp. 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T.: ''Developmental Dyscalculia. Causes, Characteristics, and Interventions.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, pp 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The CODY training targets impaired number skills that could underlie dyscalculia. The focus lies on aspects of number and quantity processing, such as quantity-number-linkage, part-whole relationship, spatial ability, relational number perception, fact retrieval, [[subitizing]], understanding of the positional notation system and [[transcoding]].&lt;ref&gt;Landerl, K./ Kaufmann, L.: ''Dyskalkulie. Modelle, Diagnostik, Intervention'', 2008, pp. 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Training includes 19 different tasks. The first version of CODY training, which had four key tasks, was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, and compared with a computer-based training of inductive reasoning. A meta-analysis by psychologists at the University of Münster about children with mathematical disorders showed: "Computer-based interventions were also effective".&lt;ref&gt;Chodura, S., Kuhn, J.-T., Holling, H.: ''Interventions for Children With Mathematical Difficulties: A Meta-Analysis. Special edited issue on developmental dyscalculia.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The math training is embedded in an adventure story and incorporates gamification via its reward system. Daily training (3–5 days per week) is recommended for maximum growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY project. Retrieved 2015-08-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
The main character of the educational game is Meister Cody, a traveler, storyteller, scholar and master magician. He receives a call for help through his crystal ball from the Kingdom of Talasia. He asks the game player to assist Princess Namea and Prince Fandales to save Talasia. The epic story has many characters, such as the Genie, Port Master, Oracle, Forest Fairies and Ice Fairies. These characters give the child clues, support and motivation.

== Application ==
The game is aimed at elementary school children from the second to fourth grade, but it also develops basic math skills that could benefit children in kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, C./ Petermann, F.:''Rechenstörungen'', 2007, pp. 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meister Cody – Talasia is an adaptive [[Single player video game|single player game]].

'''National Non-Fiction Day''' (NNFD) is annual celebration of children's [[non-fiction]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyles.co.uk/news/national-nonfiction-day-to-be-celebrated-in-uk] Foyles: National Non-Fiction Day to be celebrated in UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/reading_the_game/news/1880_national_non-fiction_day_to_debut_on_4_november] National Literacy Trust: National Non-Fiction Day to debut on 4 November&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initiated by [[Federation of Children's Book Groups|The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] in partnership with Scholastic Children’s Books and is celebrated across the UK each year on the first Thursday in November (at approximately the same time as the announcement of the winners of the [[School Library Association]] Information Book Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org.uk/information-book-award.php]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The day is used by libraries, schools, literacy organisations, book reviewers and parents to highlight the best information and narrative non-fiction books for children, and to show how it’s not just fiction that can be read and enjoyed for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achuka.co.uk/achockablog/archives/2011/10/national-non-fi.html] Achokablog: National Non-Fiction Day, This Thursday&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there is a different theme to the day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Nouvelle Tendance''' (New Tendency) was an art movement founded in Yugoslavia in 1961. The "theoretician"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the group was Serbian art critic [[Marko Mestrovich]]. The other original founders of Nouvelle Tendance were Brazilian painter [[Almir Mavignier]], and [[Bozo Bek]], the Croatian director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Nouvelle Tendance was more accurately a reflection of common approaches used by artists in a variety of simultaneous movements worldwide, such as [[Concrete art]], [[Kinetic art]], and [[Op Art]]. The main consideration of the movement has been described as the "problem of movement as conveyed through repetition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "sensation of displeasure" is provoked in some Nouvelle Tendance works, to "stimulate a more active field of vision" and interest the spectator in an "auto-creative process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct self-identified groups of artists who became associated with Nouvelle Tendance included GRAV, Gruppo T, Gruppo N, and Zero. The movement attracted artists from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. International artists participated in a series of exhibits at European galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group should not be confused with an early 20th century circle of Paris-based artists who operated briefly under the name "Tendances nouvelles" and held an exhibition in 1904; founding members included [[Alice Dannenberg]] and [[Martha Stettler]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gil Blas'', April 13, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">The '''nozzle and flapper mechanism''' is a displacement type detector which converts mechanical movement into a pressure signal, by covering the orifice of a '''nozzle''' with a flat plate called the '''flapper'''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p481 on&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the nozzle fluid flow and generates a pressure signal.

It is a widely used mechanical means of creating a high gain fluidic amplifier. In [[industrial control systems]] they played an important part in the development of pneumatic [[PID controller]]s and are still widely used today in pneumatic and hydraulic control and [[instrumentation]] systems.

==Operating principle==
[[File:Nozzle and flapper open and closed loop.png|thumb|Basic mechanism of nozzle and flapper pneumatic displacement detector.]]
The operating principle makes use of the high gain effect when a "flapper" plate is placed a small distance from a small pressurised nozzle emitting a fluid.
 
The example shown is pneumatic. At sub-millimetre distances a small movement of the flapper plate results in a large change in flow. The nozzle is fed from a chamber which is in turn fed by a restriction, so changes of flow result in changes of chamber pressure. The nozzle diameter must be larger than the restriction orifice in order to work.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p 481&lt;/ref&gt; The high gain of the open loop mechanism can be linearised using a pressure feedback bellows on the flapper to create a force balance system with a linear output. The "live" zero of 0.2 bar or 3 psi is set by the bias spring which ensures that the device is working in its linear region.

The industry standard ranges of either 3-15 psi (USA), or 0.2 - 1.0 bar (metric), is normally used in pneumatic PID controllers, valve positioner [[servomechanism]]s and force balance transducers.

==Application==
[[File:Nozzle and flapper proportional controller.png|thumb|Schematic showing nozzle and flapper used in a proportional controller context with field devices.]]
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic PID (three term) controller. The nozzle and flapper mechanism made these possible.]]
The nozzle and flapper in pneumatic controls is a simple low maintenance device which operates well in a harsh industrial environment, and does not present an explosion risk in hazardous atmospheres. They were the industry controller amplifier for many decades until the advent of practical and reliable electronic high gain amplifiers. However they are still used extensively for field devices such as [[control valve]] positioners, and I to P and P to I converters.

A proportional controller schematic is shown here.

The set point is transmitted through the flapper plate via the fulcrum to close the orifice and increase the chamber pressure. The feedback bellows resists and the output signal goes to the control valve which opens with increasing actuator pressure. As the flow increases, the process value bellows counteracts the set point bellows until equilibrium is reached. This will be a value below the set point, as there must always be an error to generate an output. The addition of an integral or "reset" bellows would remove this error.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p 488&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is also used in hydraulic systems controls.

[[Image:Litchi sinensis flowers 02.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Litchi chinensis]]'' flowers form a panicle.]]
[[Image:Sorbus glabrescens.jpg|thumb|upright|White-fruited [[Rowan]] (''[[Sorbus glabrescens]]'') corymb: the branched structures holding the fruit.]]

A '''panicle''' is a much-branched [[inflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the [[flower]]s (and [[fruit]]) be [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicellate]]. The branches of a panicle are often [[raceme]]s. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.

This type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses such as [[oat]] and [[crabgrass]],&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the inflorescence unit in a grass is the spikelet, but the arrangement of spikelets may be described as a panicle.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other plants such as [[pistachio]] and [[mamoncillo]]. Botanists use the term ''paniculate'' in two ways: "having a true panicle inflorescence" as well as "having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle".

A [[corymb]] may have a paniculate branching structure, with the lower flowers having longer [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] than the upper, thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an [[umbel]]. Many species in the subfamily [[Amygdaloideae]], such as [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]s and [[rowan]]s, produce their flowers in corymbs.

'''Pharming''', a [[portmanteau]] of "farming" and "[[pharmaceutical]]", refers to the use of [[genetic engineering]] to insert [[gene]]s that code for useful pharmaceuticals into host animals or plants that would otherwise not express those genes, thus creating a [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified organism (GMO)]].&lt;ref name="worldwide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-mol2.htm | title=Molecular farming | work=[[World Wide Words]] | accessdate=2008-09-11 | author=Quinion, Michael | authorlink=Michael Quinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0509-e.htm | title=Molecular farming | publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]] | work=[[Library of Parliament]] | date=4 July 2005 | accessdate=2008-09-11 | author=Norris, Sonya | id=PRB 05-09E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharming is also known as '''molecular farming''', '''molecular pharming'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular 'pharming' with plant P450s | first1=John M | last2=Chapple | first2=Clint | journal=[[Trends Plant Sci.]] | last1=Humphreys | year=2000 | volume=5 | issue=7 | pages=271–2 | doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(00)01680-0 | pmid=10871897}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''biopharming'''.&lt;ref name="miller2003"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Henry I. | last1=Miller | title=Will we reap what biopharming sows? | journal=[[Nat.

The products of pharming are recombinant proteins or their metabolic products.  Recombinant proteins are most commonly produced using [[bacteria]] or [[yeast]] in a [[bioreactor]], but pharming offers the advantage to the producer that it does not require expensive infrastructure, and production capacity can be quickly scaled to meet demand, at greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kaiser, Jocelyn | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=25 April 2008 | url=http://people.forestry.oregonstate.edu/steve-strauss/sites/people.forestry.oregonstate.edu.steve-strauss/files/Is%20drought%20over%20for%20pharming%20Science%202007.pdf | format=PDF | title=Is the Drought Over for Pharming? | pmid=18436771 | doi=10.1126/science.320.5875.473 | volume=320 | issue=5875 | pages=473&amp;ndash;5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
THowever, in late 2002, just as ProdiGene was ramping up production of trypsin for commercial launch&lt;ref name="Press Release on Trypsin scale-up"&gt;{{cite press release |title=ProdiGene Launches First Large Scale-Up Manufacturing of Recombinant Protein From Plant System |publisher=ProdiGene |date=February 13, 2002 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prodigene-launches-first-large-scale-up-manufacturing-of-recombinant-protein-from-plant-system-75984427.html |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was discovered that volunteer plants (left over from the prior harvest) of one of their GM corn products were harvested with the conventional soybean crop later planted in that field.&lt;ref name="News of contamination"&gt;[http://ngin.tripod.com/151102a.htm News of contamination]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ProdiGene was fined $250,000 and ordered by the USDA to pay over $3 million in cleanup costs.  This raised a furor and set the pharming field back, dramatically.&lt;ref name=Kaiser /&gt; Many companies went bankrupt as companies faced difficulties getting permits for field trials and investors fled.&lt;ref name=Kaiser /&gt;  In reaction, APHIS introduced more strict regulations for pharming field trials in the US in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Regulatory Services Factsheet [Internet]: US Department of Agriculture; c2006. Available from: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/biotechnology/content/printable_version/BRS_FS_pharmaceutical_02-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[Anheuser-Busch]] threatened to boycott rice grown in Missouri because of plans by [[Ventria Bioscience]] to grow pharm rice in the state.  A compromise was reached, but Ventria withdrew its permit to plant in Missouri due to unrelated circumstances.

The industry has slowly recovered, by focusing on pharming in simple plants grown in [[bioreactors]] and on growing GM crops in greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1408.009 |title=Bioproduction of Therapeutic Proteins in the 21st Century and the Role of Plants and Plant Cells as Production Platforms |year=2007 |last1=Boehm |first1=Robert |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1102 |pages=121–34 |pmid=17470916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies and academic groups have continued with open-field trials of GM crops that produce drugs.  In 2006 [[Dow AgroSciences]] received USDA approval to market a vaccine for poultry against [[Newcastle disease]], produced in plant cell culture – the first plant-produced vaccine approved in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/The-First-Plant-Derived-Vaccine-Approved-for-Chick/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/307471 FDA Approval News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400470 |title=Molecular farming for new drugs and vaccines |year=2005 |last1=Ma |first1=Julian K -C. |last2=Barros |first2=Eugenia |last3=Bock |first3=Ralph |last4=Christou |first4=Paul |last5=Dale |first5=Philip J. |last6=Dix |first6=Philip J. |last7=Fischer |first7=Rainer |last8=Irwin |first8=Judith |last9=Mahoney |first9=Richard |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=593–9 |pmid=15995674 |pmc=1369121|display-authors=8 |last10=Pezzotti |first10=M. |last11=Schillberg |first11=S. |last12=Sparrow |first12=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mammals==

===Historical development===
Milk is presently the most mature system to produce recombinant proteins from transgenic organisms. Blood, egg white, [[seminal plasma]], and urine are other theoretically possible systems, but all have drawbacks. Blood, for instance, as of 2012 cannot store high levels of stable recombinant proteins, and biologically active proteins in blood may alter the health of the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cimid.2007.11.005 |title=Production of pharmaceutical proteins by transgenic animals |year=2009 |last1=Houdebine |first1=Louis-Marie |journal=Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=107–21 |pmid=18243312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expression in the  milk of a mammal, such as a cow, sheep, or goat, is a common application, as milk production is plentiful and purification from milk is relatively easy.  Hamsters and rabbits have also been used in preliminary studies because of their faster breeding.

One  approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk (or blood or urine). Once an animal is produced, typically using the pronuclear microinjection method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/80231 |year=2000 |last1=Dove |first1=Alan |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1045–8 |pmid=11017040 |title=Milking the genome for profit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2009 the US FDA granted marketing approval for the first drug to be produced in genetically modified livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2008) [http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/FDAVeterinarianNewsletter/ucm190728.htm FDA Approves First Human Biologic Produced by GE Animals] US Food and Drug Administration, from the FDA Vetenarian Newsletter 2008 Volume XXIII, No VI, Retrieved 10 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is called [[ATryn]], which is antithrombin protein purified from the milk of genetically modified [[goats]].  Marketing permission was granted by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5041298.stm |title=Go-ahead for 'pharmed' goat drug |accessdate=2006-10-25 |format= |work= BBC News | date=June 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patentability issues===
As indicated above, some mammals typically used for food production (such as goats, sheep, pigs, and cows) have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called pharming. Use of genetically modified goats has been approved by the FDA and EMA to produce [[ATryn]], i.e. recombinant [[antithrombin]], an [[anticoagulant]] [[Biologic medical product|protein drug]].&lt;ref&gt;Andre Pollack for ''The New York Times''. February 6, 2009 [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/business/07goatdrug.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 F.D.A. Approves Drug From Gene-Altered Goats]&lt;/ref&gt; These products "produced by turning animals into drug-manufacturing 'machines' by genetically modifying them" are sometimes termed [[biopharmaceuticals]].

The patentability of such biopharmaceuticals and their process of manufacture is uncertain. Probably, the biopharmaceuticals themselves so made are unpatentable, assuming that they are chemically identical to the preexisting drugs that they imitate. Several 19th century [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions hold that a previously known natural product manufactured by artificial means cannot be patented.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Stern. [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/MayoPro.pdf ''Mayo v Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths''], [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502, 517. See ''Cochrane v. Badische Anili11 &amp; Soda Fabrik'', 111 U.S. 293, 311 (1884) (holding invalid claim to artificially made plant dye; "the product itself could not be patented, even though it was a product made artificially for the first time"); ''American Wood-Paper Co. v. Fibre Disintegrating Co.'', 90 U.S. 566, 596 (1874) (holding invalid claim to artificially manufactured paper-pulp because "whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it, the product was in no sense new").&lt;/ref&gt; An argument can be made for the patentability of the process for manufacturing a biopharmaceutical, however, because genetically modifying animals so that they will produce the drug is dissimilar to previous methods of manufacture; moreover, one Supreme Court decision seems to hold open that possibility.&lt;ref&gt;The ''American Wood-Paper'' case invalidated the product patent but left open the patentability of the process, saying "whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it...." 90 U.S. at 596.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the recent Supreme Court decision in ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.'', 566 U.S. __, 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; may create a problem in that, in accordance with the ruling in that case, "it may be said that such and such genes manufacture this protein in the same way they always did in a mammal, they produce the same product, and the genetic modification technology used is conventional, so that the steps of the process 'add nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Stern. [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/MayoPro.pdf ''Mayo v Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths''], [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502, 517-18 (quoting ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]''; see also ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]'', 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014) (to similar effect).&lt;/ref&gt; If the argument prevailed in court, the process would also be ineligible for patent protection. This issue has not yet been decided in the courts.

==In plants==
Plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), also referred to as pharming, is a sub-sector of the [[biotechnology]] industry that involves the process of genetically engineering plants so that they can produce certain types of therapeutically important [[proteins]] and associated molecules such as peptides and secondary metabolites.  The proteins and molecules can then be harvested and used to produce pharmaceuticals.[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wnan.1462]

[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]] is often used as a [[model organism]] to study gene expression in plants, while actual production may be carried out in [[maize]], [[rice]], [[potatoes]], [[tobacco]], [[flax]] or [[safflower]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramessar|first=Koreen|last2=Capell|first2=Teresa|last3=Christou|first3=Paul|date=2008-02-23|title=Molecular pharming in cereal crops|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11101-008-9087-3|journal=Phytochemistry Reviews|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=579–592|doi=10.1007/s11101-008-9087-3|issn=1568-7767}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Tobacco has been a highly popular choice of organism for the expression of transgenes, as it is is easily transformed, produces abundant tissues, and survives well ''in vitro'' and in greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jube|first=Sandro|last2=Borthakur|first2=Dulal|date=2007-07-15|title=Expression of bacterial genes in transgenic tobacco: methods, applications and future prospects|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19750137|journal=Electronic journal of biotechnology: EJB|volume=10|issue=3|pages=452–467|doi=10.2225/vol10-issue3-fulltext-4|issn=0717-3458|pmc=2742426|pmid=19750137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of rice and flax is that they are self-pollinating, and thus [[gene flow]] issues (see below) are avoided.  However, human error could still result in pharm crops entering the food supply.  Using a minor crop such as safflower or tobacco, avoids the greater political pressures and risk to the food supply involved with using staple crops such as beans or rice. Expression of proteins in plant cell or hairy root cultures also minimizes risk of gene transfer, but at a higher cost of production. Sterile hybrids may also be used for the bioconfinement of transgenic plants, although stable lines can't be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=J|last2=Mundell|first2=Richard E|last3=Millwood|first3=Reginald J|last4=Chambers|first4=Orlando D|last5=Stewart|first5=C|last6=Davies|first6=H|date=2013|title=Assessing the bioconfinement potential of a Nicotiana hybrid platform for use in plant molecular farming applications|url=https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-13-63|journal=BMC Biotechnology|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=63|doi=10.1186/1472-6750-13-63|issn=1472-6750|pmc=3750662|pmid=23914736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain crops are sometimes chosen for pharming because protein products targeted to the endosperm of cereals have been shown to have high heat stability. This characteristic makes them an appealing target for the production of edible vaccines, as viral coat proteins stored in grains do not require cold storage the way many vaccines currently do. Maintaining a temperature controlled supply chain of vaccines is often difficult when delivering vaccines to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Hui-Ting|last2=Xiao|first2=Yuhong|last3=Weldon|first3=William C.|last4=Oberste|first4=Steven M.|last5=Chumakov|first5=Konstantin|last6=Daniell|first6=Henry|date=2016-06-01|title=Cold chain and virus-free chloroplast-made booster vaccine to confer immunity against different poliovirus serotypes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12575|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=11|pages=2190–2200|doi=10.1111/pbi.12575|issn=1467-7644|pmc=5056803|pmid=27155248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most commonly, plant transformation is carried out using ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''. The protein of interest is often expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter ([[CaMV 35S promoter|CaMV35S]]), a powerful constitutive promoter for driving expression in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Julian K-C.|last2=Drake|first2=Pascal M.

Recently, several non-crop plants such as the [[Lemna|duckweed]] ''[[Lemna minor]]'' or the [[moss]] ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' have shown to be useful for the production of biopharmaceuticals. These frugal organisms can be cultivated in [[bioreactors]] (as opposed to being grown in fields), secrete the transformed proteins into the growth medium and, thus, substantially reduce the burden of [[protein purification]] in preparing recombinant proteins for medical use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7652.2010.00552.x |title=Production of biologically active recombinant human factor H in Physcomitrella |year=2011 |last1=Büttner-Mainik |first1=Annette |last2=Parsons |first2=Juliana |last3=Jérôme |first3=Hanna |last4=Hartmann |first4=Andrea |last5=Lamer |first5=Stephanie |last6=Schaaf |first6=Andreas |last7=Schlosser |first7=Andreas |last8=Zipfel |first8=Peter F. |last9=Reski |first9=Ralf |journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=373–83 |pmid=20723134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John R. |last1=Gasdaska |first2=David |last2=Spencer |first3=Lynn |last3=Dickey |year=2003 |title=Advantages of Therapeutic Protein Production in the Aquatic Plant Lemna |journal=BioProcessing Journal |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=49–56 |url=http://www.bioprocessingjournal.com/index.php/article-downloads/329-j22-advantages-of-therapeutic-protein-production-in-the-aquatic-plant-lemna |doi=10.12665/j22.gasdaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7652.2005.00127.x |title=Enhanced recovery of a secreted recombinant human growth factor using stabilizing additives and by co-expression of human serum albumin in the moss Physcomitrella patens |year=2005 |last1=Baur |first1=Armin |last2=Reski |first2=Ralf |last3=Gorr |first3=Gilbert |journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=331–40 |pmid=17129315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both species can be engineered to cause secretion of proteins with human patterns of [[glycosylation]], an improvement over conventional plant gene-expression systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1260 |title=Glycan optimization of a human monoclonal antibody in the aquatic plant Lemna minor |year=2006 |last1=Cox |first1=Kevin M |last2=Sterling |first2=Jason D |last3=Regan |first3=Jeffrey T |last4=Gasdaska |first4=John R |last5=Frantz |first5=Karen K |last6=Peele |first6=Charles G |last7=Black |first7=Amelia |last8=Passmore |first8=David |last9=Moldovan-Loomis |first9=Cristina |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1591–7 |pmid=17128273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decker (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00449-007-0151-y |title=Current achievements in the production of complex biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactors |year=2007 |last1=Decker |first1=Eva L. |last2=Reski |first2=Ralf |journal=Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering |volume=31 |pages=3–9 |pmid=17701058 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biolex]] Therapeutics developed a duckweed-based expression platform; it sold that business to [[Synthon (company)|Synthon]] and declared bankruptcy in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops – including those used for pharming – between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.

==Controversy==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

There are controversies around GMOs generally on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, issues concerning intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.  There are also specific controversies around pharming.

===Advantages===
[[Plants]] do not carry [[pathogens]] that might be dangerous to human [[health]]. Additionally, on the level of [[pharmacologically]] active [[protein]]s, there are no proteins in plants that are similar to human proteins. On the other hand, plants are still sufficiently closely related to animals and humans that they are able to correctly process and configure both animal and human proteins. Their seeds and fruits also provide sterile packaging containers for the valuable therapeutics and guarantee a certain storage life.&lt;ref name="BioPro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/thema/00178/index.html?lang=en|title=Molecular Farming – Plant Bioreactors|publisher=BioPro|accessdate=2008-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203226/http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/thema/00178/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pharmaceutical crops could become extremely beneficial in developing countries.  The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that nearly 3 million people die each year from vaccine preventable disease, mostly in Africa.  Diseases such as measles and hepatitis lead to deaths in countries where the people cannot afford the high costs of vaccines, but pharm crops could help solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=JA |title=Seeds for the future: The impact of genetically modified crops on the environment |location=Australia |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2006}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
While molecular farming is one application of [[genetic engineering]], there are concerns that are unique to it. In the case of [[genetically modified]] (GM) foods, concerns focus on the safety of the food for [[Ingestion|human consumption]]. In response, it has been argued that the genes that enhance a [[crop]] in some way, such as [[drought resistance]] or [[pesticide resistance]], are not believed to affect the food itself. Other GM foods in development, such as fruits designed to ripen faster or grow larger, are believed not to affect humans any differently from non-GM varieties.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BioPro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/11/48108|title=Molecular Farming Under Fire|last=Mandel|first=Charles|publisher=wired|accessdate=2008-09-13|date=2001-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, molecular farming is not intended for crops destined for the [[food chain]]. It produces plants that contain [[physiology|physiologically]] active compounds that accumulate in the plant’s tissues. Considerable attention is focused, therefore, on the restraint and caution necessary to protect both consumer health and environmental [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

The fact that the plants are used to produce drugs alarms [[activists]]. They worry that once production begins, the altered plants might find their way into the food supply or [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] with conventional, non-GM crops.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;  These concerns have historical validation from the ProdiGene incident, and from the [[Transgenic maize|StarLink]] incident, in which [[Genetically Modified|GMO]] corn accidentally ended up in commercial food products.  Activists also are concerned about the power of business. According to the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]], in a recent report, says that U.S. demand alone for biotech pharmaceuticals is expanding at 13 percent annually and to reach a market value of $28.6 billion in 2004.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Pharming is expected to be worth $100 billion globally by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molecularfarming.com/about.html|title=Protein Products for Future Global Good|publisher=molecularfarming.com|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of religion''' is "the philosophical examination of the central themes and concepts involved in religious traditions."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Philosophy of Religion|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/|date = 1 January 2014|first = Charles|last = Taliaferro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sorts of philosophical discussion are ancient, and can be found in the earliest known [[manuscripts]] concerning philosophy. The field is related to many other branches of philosophy, including [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion differs from [[religious philosophy]] in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief system. It is designed such that it can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as [[religious belief|believers]] or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=C. Stephen|title=Philosophy of Religion: Thinking about Faith|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1985|pages=16|isbn=978-0-87784-343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Bronnikov gimnpifagoreizev.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pythagoreans Celebrate the Sunrise'' (1869) by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]. [[Pythagoreanism]] is one example of a [[Greek philosophy]] that also included religious elements.]]
Philosopher [[William L. Rowe]] characterized the philosophy of religion as: "the critical examination of basic religious beliefs and concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Philosophy of Religion, An Introduction, Fourth Edition, 2007, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of religion covers alternative beliefs about God (or gods), the varieties of [[religious experience]], the interplay between science and religion, the nature and scope of good and evil, and religious treatments of birth, history, and death.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; The field also includes the ethical implications of religious commitments, the relation between faith, reason, experience and tradition, concepts of the miraculous, the sacred revelation, mysticism, power, and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin, N, Tsui-James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNWIcgEswrsC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=philosophy+of+religion+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RvFjVPmhPKSe7gbU1YGgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20religion%20field&amp;f=false ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 453.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Philosophy of Religion" did not come into general use in the West until the nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, WJ., [https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC&amp;dq=oxford+handbook+Philosophy+religion&amp;q=%22come+into+general%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22come%20into%20general%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion''], Oxford Handbooks Online, 2004, p. 3. "The expression "philosophy of religion" did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice."&lt;/ref&gt; and most pre-modern and early modern philosophical works included a mixture of religious themes and "non-religious" philosophical questions. In Asia, examples include texts such as the Hindu [[Upanishads]], the works of [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhist texts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: History of the philosophy of religion.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophies like [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Stoicism]] included religious elements and theories about deities, and [[Medieval philosophy]] was strongly influenced by the big three Monotheistic [[Abrahamic religions]]. In the Western world, early modern philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], and [[George Berkeley]] discussed religious topics alongside secular philosophical issues as well. &lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion/#FieSig "Philosophy of Religion."]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosophy of religion has been distinguished from [[theology]] by pointing out that, for theology, "its critical reflections are based on religious convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Theology.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "theology is responsible to an authority that initiates its thinking, speaking, and witnessing ... [while] philosophy bases its arguments on the ground of timeless evidence."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590855/theology/14945/Relationship-to-philosophy Theology; Relationship of theology to the history of religions and philosophy; Relationship to philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of philosophy of religion have classically been regarded as a part of [[metaphysics]]. In [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics'', the necessarily prior cause of eternal motion was an [[unmoved mover]], who, like the object of desire, or of thought, inspires motion without itself being moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abu.nb.ca/courses/grphil/philrel/aristotle.htm Aristotle], Professor Barry D. Smith, Crandall University&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Aristotle, is God, the subject of study in [[theology]]. Today, however, philosophers have adopted the term "philosophy of religion" for the subject, and typically it is regarded as a separate field of specialization, although it is also still treated by some, particularly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[philosopher]]s, as a part of metaphysics.

==Basic themes and problems==
===Ultimate Reality===
Different religions have different ideas about Ultimate Reality, its source or ground (or lack thereof) and also about what is the "Maximal Greatness".&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, Part II in general&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William, "Concepts of God", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/concepts-god/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of 'Ultimate Concern' and [[Rudolf Otto]]'s 'Idea of the Holy' are concepts which point to concerns about the ultimate or highest truth which most religious philosophies deal with in some way. One of the main differences among religions is whether the Ultimate Reality is a personal God or an impersonal reality.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister, Chad. Introducing Philosophy of Religion. Routledge 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Western religions, various forms of [[Theism]] are the most common conceptions of the ultimate Good, while in [[Eastern Religions]], there are theistic and also various non-theistic conceptions of the Ultimate. Theistic vs non-theistic is a common way of sorting the different types of religions.&lt;ref&gt;see the whole structure of 'Yandell, 2002.'&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several philosophical positions with regard to the existence of [[God]] that one might take including various forms of [[Theism]] (such as [[Monotheism]] and [[Polytheism]]), [[Agnosticism]] and different forms of [[Atheism]].

====Monotheism====
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Aquinas]] considered five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).]]
{{Main|Existence of God}}
Monotheism is the belief in a single deity or [[God]], who is ontologically independent.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many forms of monotheism. [[Keith Yandell]] outlines roughly three kinds of historical monotheisms: Greek, Semitic and Hindu. Greek monotheism holds that the world has always existed and does not believe in Creationism or divine providence, while Semitic monotheism believes the world is created by a God at a particular point in time and that this God acts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith E. PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION A contemporary introduction, Routledge, 2002, page 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian monotheism meanwhile teaches that the world is beginningless, but that there is God's act of creation which sustains the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt to provide proofs or arguments for the existence of [[God]] is one aspect of what is known as [[natural theology]] or the natural theistic project. This strand of natural theology attempts to justify belief in God by independent grounds. Perhaps most of philosophy of religion is predicated on natural theology's assumption that the existence of God can be justified or warranted on rational grounds. There has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds of proofs, justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this discourse.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Antony Flew]], [[John Polkinghorne]], [[Keith Ward]], [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Richard Swinburne]]&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of arguments for the existence of god include:

*[[Cosmological Argument]]
*[[Ontological Argument]]
*[[Teleological argument]]
*[[Argument from religious experience]]
*[[Argument from morality]]
*Wager arguments like [[Pascal's Wager]] attempts to rationally argue that one ''should'' believe in God.

Skeptics and atheists have put forth various arguments against the existence of God including:

*The [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]
*The [[problem of evil]], the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with that of a [[deity]] who is, in either absolute or relative terms, [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Argument from poor design]]
*[[Argument from nonbelief]] or the argument from divine hiddenness

====Non-theistic conceptions====
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|225px|The Buddhist [[Vasubandhu]] argued against Hindu Creator God views and for an impersonal conception of absolute reality that has been described as a form of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Sean (2011) "Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism," The Hilltop Review: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 6. Available at: http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/hilltopreview/vol4/iss1/6&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Eastern Religions have included both theistic and other alternative positions about the ultimate nature of reality. One such view is [[Jainism]], which holds a dualistic view that all that exists is matter and a multiplicity of souls ([[jiva]]), without depending on a supreme deity for their existence. There are also different Buddhist views, such as the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] view, which holds that the only ultimately existing things are transitory phenomenal events (''[[Abhidharma#Dharma_theory|dharmas]]'') and their [[dependent origination|interdependent relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists such as [[Nagarjuna]] hold that Ultimate reality is emptiness ([[shunyata]]) while the [[Yogacara]] holds that it is ''vijñapti'' (mental phenomena). In Indian philosophical discourses, monotheism was defended by Hindu philosophers (particularly the [[Nyaya]] school), while Buddhist thinkers argued against their conception of a Creator God (Sanskrit: [[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad (Reviewer) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Nyaya&amp;f=false Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India]''. By Parimal Patil. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. Pp. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu view of [[Advaita Vedanta]], as defended by [[Adi Shankara]], is a total [[non-dualism]]. Though Advaitins do believe in the usual Hindu gods, their view of ultimate reality is a radically [[monistic]] oneness ([[Brahman]] without qualities) and anything which appears (like persons and gods) is illusory (''maya'').&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The various philosophical positions of Chinese [[Taoism]] can also be viewed as non-theistic about the ultimate reality ([[Tao]]).

For most of these non-theistic traditions, the path to ultimate reality includes various spiritual practices such as [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].

It is important to note that the above philosophical views do not necessarily entail atheism. Traditionally, Jains and Buddhists did not rule out the existence of limited deities or divine beings, they only rejected the idea of a single all powerful creator God or First cause posited by monotheists.

===Knowledge and belief===
{{See also|Belief#Religion}}
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|thumb|The [[Blind men and an elephant]] is a parable widely used in Buddhism and Jainism to illustrate the dangers of dogmatic religious belief]]
All religious traditions make knowledge claims which they argue are central to religious practice and to the ultimate solution to the main problem of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; These include epistemic, metaphysical and ethical claims. 

[[Evidentialism]] is the position that may be characterized as "a belief is rationally justified only if there is sufficient evidence for it".&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; Many theists and non-theists are evidentialists, for example, Aquinas and Bertrand Russell agree that belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence, but disagree on whether such evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 105&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments often stipulate that subjective religious experiences are not reasonable evidence and thus religious truths must be argued based on non-religious evidence. One of the strongest positions of evidentialism is that by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who wrote: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent supporters of evidentialism include [[Antony Flew]] ("The Presumption of Atheism", 1972) and [[Michael Scriven]] (Primary philosophy, 1966). Both of them rely on the [[Ockhamist]] view that in the absence of evidence for X, belief in X is not justified. Many modern [[Thomists]] are also evidentialists in that they hold they can demonstrate there is evidence for the belief in God. Another move is to argue in a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] way for the probability of a religious truth like God, not for total conclusive evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers however, argue that religious belief is warranted ''without evidence'' and hence are sometimes called ''non-evidentialists''. They include [[Fideism|fideists]] and [[reformed epistemologists]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] and other [[reformed epistemologists]] are examples of philosophers who argue that religious beliefs are "properly basic beliefs" and that it is not irrational to hold them even though they are not supported by any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale here is that some beliefs we hold must be foundational and not be based on further rational beliefs, if this is not so we risk an [[infinite regress]]. This is qualified by the proviso that they can be defended against objections (this differentiates this view from fideism). A properly basic belief is a belief that one can reasonably hold without evidence, such as a memory, a basic sensation or a perception. Plantinga's argument is that belief in God is of this type, because within every human mind there is a natural awareness of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] in his essay "[[The Will to Believe]]" argues for a pragmatic conception of religious belief. For James, religious belief is justified if one is presented with a question which is rationally undecidable and if one is presented with genuine and live options which are relevant for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 98&lt;/ref&gt; For James, religious belief is defensible because of the pragmatic value it can bring to one's life, even if there is no rational evidence for it.

Some work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over evidentialism, fideism, and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from new ideas about knowledge-how and practical skill; how practical factors can affect whether one could know whether theism is true; from formal epistemology's use of probability theory; or from social epistemology (particularly the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement).&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see {{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |last2=Hawthorne |first2=John |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Dani |title=Knowledge, Belief, and God: New Insights in Religious Epistemology |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780198798705 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/knowledge-belief-and-god-9780198798705}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an important topic in the epistemology of religion is that of religious disagreement, and the issue of what it means for intelligent individuals of the same epistemic parity to disagree about religious issues. Religious disagreement has been seen as possibly posing first-order or higher-order problems for religious belief. A first order problem refers to whether that evidence directly applies to the truth of any religious proposition, while a higher order problem instead applies to ''whether one has rationally assessed'' the first order evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pittard, John. Religious Disagreement, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/rel-disa/&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a first order problem is the [[Argument from nonbelief]]. Higher order discussions focus on whether religious disagreement with epistemic peers (someone whose epistemic ability is equal to our own) demands us to adopt a skeptical or agnostic stance or whether to reduce or change our religious beliefs.

===Faith and reason===
While religions resort to rational arguments to attempt to establish their views, they also claim that religious belief is at least partially to be accepted through [[faith]], confidence or trust in one's religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 91&lt;/ref&gt; There are different conceptions or models of faith, including:&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, John, "Faith", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/faith/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] model of faith sees it as a feeling of trust, a psychological state
*The special knowledge model of faith as revealing specific religious truths (defended by [[Reformed epistemology]])
*The belief model of faith as the theoretical conviction that a certain religious claim is true.
*Faith as trusting, as making a [[Fiduciary|fiducial]] commitment such as trusting in God.
*The practical [[doxastic]] venture model where faith is seen as a commitment to believe in the trustworthiness of a religious truth or in God. In other words, to trust in God presupposes belief, thus faith must include elements of belief and trust.
*The non-doxastic venture model of faith as practical commitment ''without actual belief'' (defended by non-realists like [[J. L. Schellenberg]] and [[Don Cupitt]]). In this view, one need not believe in literal religious claims about reality to have religious faith. 
*The hope model, faith as hoping

There are also different positions on how faith relates to reason. One example is the belief that faith and reason are compatible and work together, which is the view of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the orthodox view of Catholic [[natural theology]]. According to this view, reason establishes certain religious truths and faith (guided by reason) gives us access to truths about the divine which, according to Aquinas, "exceed all the ability of human reason."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another position on is [[Fideism]], the view that faith is "in some sense independent of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason."&lt;ref&gt;Amesbury, Richard, "Fideism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/fideism/.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was famously defended by the theologian [[Tertullian]] (c.160–230 CE). Modern philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]] have been associated with this label. [[Kierkegaard]] in particular, argued for the necessity of the religious to take a non-rational [[leap of faith]] to bridge the gulf between man and God. Wittgensteinian fideism meanwhile sees religious [[language games]] as being incommensurate with scientific and metaphysical language games, and that they are autonomous and thus may only be judged on their own standards. The obvious criticism to this is that many religions clearly put forth metaphysical claims.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Peter, "The Epistemology of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/religion-epistemology/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several contemporary [[New Atheist]] writers which are hostile to religion hold a related view which says that religious claims and scientific claims are opposed to each other, and that therefore religions are false.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant theologian [[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968) argued that religious believers have no need to prove their beliefs through reason and thus rejected the project of [[natural theology]]. According to Barth, human reason is corrupt and God is utterly different from his creatures, thus we can only rely on God's own revelation for religious knowledge. Barth's view has been termed [[Neo-orthodoxy]]. &lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[D.Z. Phillips]] argues that God is not intelligible through reason or evidence because God is not an empirical object or a 'being among beings'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Brian Davies points out, the problem with positions like Barth's is that they do not help us in deciding between [[Argument from inconsistent revelations|inconsistent and competing revelations]] of the different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main article|Relationship between religion and science}}

The topic of whether religious beliefs are compatible with [[science]] and in what way is also another important topic in the philosophy of religion as well as in [[theology]]. This field draws the historical study of their interactions and conflicts, such as the debates in the United States over the teaching of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different models of interaction that have been discussed in the philosophical literature, including :&lt;ref&gt;De Cruz, Helen, "Religion and Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/religion-science/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Conflict thesis]] which sees them as being in constant conflict, such as during the reception of the theory of [[evolution]] and the current debate over [[creationism]].
*Independence model, both have separate domains, or [[non-overlapping magisteria]]
*Dialogue model, some overlap between the fields, they remain separate but share some concepts and presuppositions
*Integration or unification model includes projects like [[natural theology]] and [[process theology]]

The field also draws the scientific study of religion, particularly by psychologists and sociologists as well as cognitive scientists. Various theories about religion have arisen from these various disciplines. One example is the various [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary theories of religion]] which see the phenomenon as either adaptive or a by-product. Another can be seen in the various theories put forth by the [[Cognitive science of religion]].

===Religious experience===
{{See also|Religious experience|Phenomenology of religion}}
[[File:William_James_b1842c.jpg|thumb|225px|[[William James]] wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].]]
Closely tied to the issues of knowledge and belief is the question of how to interpret [[religious experiences]] vis-à-vis their potential for providing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious experiences have been recorded throughout all cultures and are widely diverse. These personal experiences tend to be highly important to the individuals who undergo them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about religious experiences can be said to be informed in part by the question: "what sort of information about what there is might religious experience provide, and how could one tell?"&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One could interpret these experiences either veridically, neutrally or as delusions. Both monotheistic and non-monotheistic religious thinkers and mystics have appealed to religious experiences as evidence for their claims about ultimate reality. Philosophers such as [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[William Alston]] have compared religious experiences to everyday perceptions, that is, both are [[noesis|noetic]] and have a perceptual object, and thus religious experiences could logically be veridical unless we have a good reason to disbelieve them.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]] common objections against the veridical force of religious experiences include the fact that experience is frequently deceptive and that people who claim an experience of a god may be "mistakenly identifying an object of their experience", or be insane or hallucinating.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues that we cannot deduce from the fact that our experiences are ''sometimes'' mistaken, hallucinations or distorted to the conclusion that all religious experiences are mistaken etc. Indeed, a drunken or hallucinating person could still perceive things correctly, therefore these objections cannot be said to ''necessarily'' disprove all religious experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to C. B. Martin, "there are no tests agreed upon to establish genuine experience of God and distinguish it decisively from the ungenuine", and therefore all that religious experiences can establish is the reality of these psychological states.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naturalistic explanations for religious experiences are often seen as undermining their epistemic value. Explanations such as the [[Death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[suggestion]], [[Regression (psychology)|infantile regression]], [[sexual frustration]], neurological anomalies ("it's all in the head") as well as the socio-political power that having such experiences might grant to a mystic have been put forward.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; A hostile position was famously taken by [[Bertrand Russell]] who have compared the veridical value of religious experiences to the [[hallucinations]] of a drunk person: "From a scientific point of view, we can make no distinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell "Mysticism" From Religion and Science (Oxford University Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[William L. Rowe]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hidden assumption in Russell's argument is that bodily and mental states that interfere with reliable perceptions of the physical world also interfere with reliable perceptions of a spiritual world beyond the physical, if there is such a spiritual world to be perceived. Perhaps this assumption is reasonable, but it certainly is not obviously true.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, as argued by [[C.D. Broad]], "one might need to be slightly 'cracked'" or at least appear to be mentally and physically abnormal in order to perceive the supranormal spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 85&lt;/ref&gt; 

William James meanwhile takes a middle course between accepting mystical experiences as veridical or seeing them as delusional. He argues that for the individual who experiences them, they are authoritative and they break down the authority of the rational mind. Not only that, but according to James, the mystic is justified in this. But when it comes to the non-mystic, the outside observer, they have no reason to regard them as either veridical nor delusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of religious experiences from the perspective of the field of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has also been a feature of the philosophy of religion. Key thinkers in this field include [[William Brede Kristensen]] and [[Gerard van der Leeuw]].

Just like there are different religions, there are different forms of religious experience. One could have "subject/content" experiences (such as a euphoric meditative state) and "subject/consciousness/object" experiences (such as the perception of having seen a god, i.e. [[theophany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, 2002, p. 40, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences of [[theophany]] are described in ancient Mediterranean religious works and myths and include the story of [[Semele]] who died due to her seeing [[Zeus]] and the Biblical story of the [[Burning bush]]. Indian texts like the [[Bhagavadgita|Bhagavad Gita]] also contain theophanic events. The diversity (sometimes to the point of contradiction) of religious experiences has also been used as an argument against their veridical nature, and as evidence that they are a purely subjective psychological phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western thought, religious experience (mainly a theistic one) has been described by the likes of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[William James]]. According to Schleiermacher, the distinguishing feature of a religious experience is that "one is overcome by the feeling of absolute dependence."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, 2007, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Otto meanwhile, argued that while this was an important element, the most basic feature of religious experiences is that it is ''[[numinous]]''. He described this as "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self" as well as having the qualities of being a mystery, terrifying and fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). Alles, Gregory D., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Autobiographical and Social Essays'']. Berlin: [[Walter de Gruyter]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30]. {{ISBN|978-3-110-14519-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rowe meanwhile defined a religious experience as "an experience in which one senses the immediate presence of the divine."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rowe, religious experiences can be divided in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 73, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

*Religious experiences in which one senses the presence of the divine as being distinct from oneself.
*Mystical experiences in which one senses one's own union with a divine presence.
**The extrovertive way looks outward through the senses into the world around us and finds the divine reality there.
**The introvertive way turns inward and finds the divine reality in the deepest part of the self.

Non-monotheistic religions meanwhile also report different experiences from theophany, such as [[non-dual]] experiences of oneness and deeply focused meditative states (termed [[Samadhi]] in Indian religion) as well as experiences of final enlightenment or liberation ([[moksha]], [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], [[kevala]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] respectively).

Another typology, offered by Chad Meister, differentiates between three major experiences:&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 171-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Regenerative experiences, in which an individual feels reborn, transformed or changed radically, usually resulting in religious conversion.
*Charismatic experiences, in which special gifts, abilities, or blessings are manifested (such as healing, visions, etc.)
*[[Mystical experiences]], which can be described using William James qualifications as being: [[Ineffable]], [[Noesis|Noetic]], transient and passive.

====Perennialism vs Constructivism====
Another debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences ([[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]]) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed ([[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] or [[Contextualism]]). According to [[Walter Stace]] all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted "Pure Conscious Events" which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Ninian Smart]] argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some constructivists like [[Steven T. Katz]] meanwhile have argued against the common core thesis, and for either the view that every mystical experience contains at least some concepts (soft constructivism) or that they are strongly shaped and determined by one's religious ideas and culture (hard constructivism).&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the conceptual scheme of any mystic strongly shapes their experiences and because mystics from different religions have very different schemas, there cannot be any universal mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mysticism/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and ethics===
[[File:Sacrifice of Isaac-Caravaggio (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Caravaggio]].]]
All religions argue for certain values and ideas of the moral Good. Non-monotheistic Indian traditions like Buddhism and [[Advaita Vedanta]] find the highest Good in [[nirvana]] or [[moksha]] which leads to release from suffering and the [[Samsara|rounds of rebirth]] and morality is a means to achieve this, while for monotheistic traditions, God is the source or ground of all morality and heaven in the highest human good. The world religions also offer different conceptions of the source of [[evil]] and [[suffering]] in the world, that is, what is wrong with human life and how to solve and free ourselves from these dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 180&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for Christianity, [[Sin in Christianity|sin]] is the source of human problems, while for Buddhism, it is [[Taṇhā|craving]] and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]]. 

A general question which philosophy of religion asks is what is the relationship, if any, between morality and religion. Brian Davies outlines four possible theses:&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Morality somehow requires religion. One example of this view is [[Kant]]'s idea that morality should lead us to believe in a moral law, and thus to believe in an upholder of that law, that is, God.
*Morality is somehow included in religion, "The basic idea here is that being moral is part of what being religious means."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Morality is pointless without religion, for one would have no reason to be moral without it.
*Morality and religion are opposed to each other. In this view, belief in a God would mean one would do whatever that God commands, even if it goes against morality. The view that religion and morality are often opposed has been espoused by atheists like [[Lucretius]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] as well as by theologians like [[Kierkegaard]] who argued for a '[[Fear_and_Trembling#Teleological_Suspension_of_the_Ethical|teleological suspension of the ethical]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, pg. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheistic religions who seek to explain morality and its relationship to God must deal with what is termed the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], famously stated in the [[Platonic dialogue]] "[[Euthyphro]]" as: "Is the [[Piety|pious]] (τὸ ὅσιον, i.e. what is morally good) loved by the [[Deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" Those who hold that what is moral is so ''because'' it is what God commands are defending a version of the [[Divine command theory]].

Another important topic which is widely discussed in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] monotheistic religious philosophy is the problem of human [[Free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. God's omniscience could presumably include perfect knowledge of the future, leading to [[Theological determinism]] and thus possibly contradicting with human free will.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Lockyer Jordan; Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate; Neil Lockyer; Edwin Tate (25 June 2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC ''Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition'']. Nelson Thornes. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-7487-8078-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different positions on this including [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] (free will is true) and [[Predestination]].

===Miracles===
{{Main article|Miracle}}
Belief in [[miracles]] and [[supernatural]] events or occurrences is common among world religions. A miracle is an event which cannot be explained by rational or scientific means. The [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Miracles of Muhammad]] are examples of miracles claimed by religions.

[[Skepticism]] towards the supernatural can be found in early philosophical traditions like the Indian [[Carvaka]] school and Greco-Roman philosophers like [[Lucretius]]. [[David Hume]], who defined a miracle as "a violation of the laws of nature", famously argued against miracles in [[Of Miracles]], Section X of ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748). For Hume, the probability that a miracle hasn't occurred is always greater than the probability that it has because "as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws [of nature], the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined" (''Enquiry''. X. p. 173).[http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Hume/HumeMiracles.pdf] Hume doesn't argue that a miracle is impossible, only that it is unreasonable to believe in any testimony of a miracle's occurrence, for evidence for the regularity of natural laws is much stronger than human testimony (which is often in error).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 142&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rowe, there are two weaknesses with Hume's argument. First, there could be other forms of indirect evidence for the occurrence of a miracle that does not include testimony of someone's direct experience of it. Secondly, Rowe argues that Hume overestimates "the weight that should be given to past experience in support of some principle thought to be a law of nature." For it is a common occurrence that currently accepted ideas of natural laws are revised due to an observed exception but Hume's argument would lead one to conclude that these exceptions do not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 143&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe adds that "It remains true, however, that a reasonable person will require quite strong evidence before believing that a law of nature has been violated. It is easy to believe the person who claimed to see water run downhill, but quite difficult to believe that someone saw water run uphill."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of a miracle is possible however, which is termed the [[Epistemic theory of miracles]] and was argued for by [[Spinoza]] and [[St. Augustine]]. This view rejects that a miracle is a transgression of natural laws, but is simply a transgression of our current ''understanding'' of natural law. In the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', [[Spinoza]] writes: "miracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to any ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and narrator of the miracle" (''Tractatus'' p. 84). Similarly, R.F. Holland has defined miracle in a naturalistic way in a widely cited paper. For Holland, a miracle need only be an extraordinary and beneficial coincidence interpreted religiously.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.F. (1965), "The Miraculous," ''American Philosophical Quarterly ''2:43-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Davies notes that even if we can establish that a miracle has occurred, it is hard to see what this is supposed to prove. For it is possible that they arise due to agencies which are unusual and powerful, but not divine.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1993, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afterlife===
{{Main article|Afterlife}}
World Religions put forth various theories which affirm [[life after death]] and different kinds of postmortem existence. This is often tied to belief in an immortal individual [[soul]] or self ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) separate from the body which survives death, as defended by [[Plato]], [[Descartes]], Monotheistic religions like Christianity and many [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]]. This view is also a position on the [[mind body problem]], mainly, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; This view then must show not only that dualism is true and that souls exist, but also that souls survive death. As [[Kant]] famously argued, the mere existence of a soul does not prove its immortality, for one could conceive that a soul, even if it is totally simple, could still fade away or lose its intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.H. Price]] is one modern philosopher who has speculated at length about what it would be like to be a disembodied soul after death. 

One major issue with soul beliefs is that since [[personhood]] is closely tied to our physical bodies, it seems difficult to make sense of a human being existing apart from their body. A further issue is with continuity of [[personal identity]], that is, it is not easy to account for the claim that the person that exists after bodily death is the ''same'' person that existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 150-151&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bertrand Russell]] put forth the general scientific argument against the afterlife as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persons are part of the everyday world with which science is concerned, and the conditions which determine their existence are discoverable...we know that the brain is not immortal, and that the organized energy of a living body becomes, as it were, demobilized at death and therefore not available for collective action. All the evidence goes to show that what we regard as our mental life is bound up with brain structure and organized bodily energy. Therefore it is rational to suppose that mental life ceases when bodily life ceases. The argument is only one of probability, but it is as strong as those upon which most scientific conclusions are based.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contra Russell, [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] argues that we have no scientific proof that the mind is dependent on the body in this particular way. As Rowe notes, the fact that the mind depends on the functions of the body while one is alive is not necessarily proof that the mind will cease functioning after death just as a person trapped in a room while depending on the windows to see the outside world might continue to see even after the room ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] is one religion which, while affirming postmortem existence (through [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), denies the existence of individual souls and instead affirms a deflationary view of personal identity, termed ''not-self'' ([[anatta]]).

While [[physicalism]] has generally been seen as hostile to notions of an afterlife, this need not be the case. Abrahamic religions like Christianity have traditionally held that life after death will include the element of bodily resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; One objection to this view is that it seems difficult to account for personal continuity, at best, a resurrected body is a replica of the resurrected person not the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; One response is the constitution view of persons, which says persons are constituted by their bodies and by a "first-person perspective", the capacity to think of oneself ''as oneself''. In this view, what is resurrected is that first person perspective, or both the person's body and that perspective. An objection to this view is that it seems difficult to differentiate one person's first person perspective from another person's without reference to temporal and spatial relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter van Inwagen]] meanwhile, offers the following theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps at the moment of each man's death, God removes his corpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or rots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He removes for "safekeeping" only the "core person"—the brain and central nervous system—or even some special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992: 245–46)&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view shows how some positions on the nature of the afterlife are closely tied to and sometimes completely depend upon theistic positions. This close connection between the two views was made by [[Kant]], who argued that one can infer an afterlife from belief in a just God who rewards persons for their adherence to moral law.&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions on the philosophy of the afterlife deal with phenomena such as [[near death experiences]], [[reincarnation research]], and other [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] events and hinge on whether naturalistic explanations for these phenomena is enough to explain them or not. Such discussions are associated with philosophers like [[William James]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[C.D. Broad]], and [[H.H. Price]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasker, William and Taliaferro, Charles, "Afterlife", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/afterlife/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity and pluralism===
{{See also|Religious pluralism}}
[[Image:Yashovijaya.jpg|thumb|225px|Jain philosophers, such as [[Yashovijaya]], defended a theory of [[Anekantavada]] which could be interpreted as a form of inclusivism.]]
The issue of how one is to understand religious diversity and the plurality of religious views and beliefs has been a central concern of the philosophy of religion. 

There are various philosophical positions regarding how one is to make sense of religious diversity, including exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, [[atheism]] or [[antireligion]] and [[agnosticism]]. 

[[Religious exclusivism]] is the claim that only one religion is true and that others are wrong. To say that a religion is exclusivistic can also mean that salvation or human freedom is only attainable by the followers of one's religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 181&lt;/ref&gt; This view tends to be the orthodox view of most monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Islam, though liberal and modernist trends within them might differ. William L Rowe outlines two problems with this view. The first problem is that it is easy to see that if this is true, a large portion of humanity is excluded from salvation and it is hard to see how a loving god would desire this. The second problem is that once we become acquainted with the saintly figures and virtuous people in other religions, it can be difficult to see how we could say they are excluded from salvation just because they are not part of our religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 182&lt;/ref&gt; 

A different view is inclusivism, which is the idea that "one's own tradition alone has the whole truth but that this truth is nevertheless partially reflected in other traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; An inclusivist might maintain that their religion is privileged, they can also hold that other religious adherents have fundamental truths and even that they will be saved or liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain view of [[Anekantavada]] ('many-sidedness') has been interpreted by some as a tolerant view which is an inclusive acceptance of the partial truth value of non-Jain religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Barbato, Melanie. Jain Approaches to Plurality: Identity as Dialogue. BRILL 2017, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As Paul Dundas notes, the Jains ultimately held the thesis that Jainism is the final truth, while other religions only contain partial truths.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dundas (2004). Tara Sethia, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC ''Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism'']. Motilal Banarsidass. p. 123-125. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2036-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as Kristin Beise Kiblinger have also argued that some of the Buddhist traditions include inclusivist ideas and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Beise Kiblinger. Buddhist Inclusivism: Attitudes Towards Religious Others&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Western study of religion, the work of [[Ninian Smart]] has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism. Smart's view is that there are genuine differences between religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pluralism is the view that all religions are equally valid responses to the divine and that they are all valid paths to personal transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 185&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is taken by [[John Hick]], who has developed a pluralistic view which synthesizes components of various religious traditions. Hick promotes an idea of a noumenal sacred reality which different religions provide us access to.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick defines his view as "the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real or the Ultimate."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. "On Conflicting Religious Truth-Claims," p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; For Hick, all religions are true because they all allow us to encounter the divine reality, even if they have different deities and conceptions of it. Rowe notes that a similar idea is proposed by [[Paul Tillich]]'s concept of ''Being-itself''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of [[Perennial philosophy|perennialism]] is that there is a single or core truth or experience which is shared by all religions even while they use different terms and language to express it. This view is espoused by the likes of [[Aldous Huxley]], the thinkers of the [[Traditionalist School]] as well as [[Neo-Vedanta]]. 

Yet another way of responding to the conflicting truth claims of religions is [[Relativism]]. [[Joseph Runzo]]., one of its most prominent defenders, has argued for ''henofideism'' which states that the truth of a religious worldview is relative to each community of adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while religions have incompatible views, each one is individually valid as they emerge from individual experiences of a plurality of phenomenal divine realities.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to Runzo, this view does not reduce the incompatible ideas and experiences of different religions to mere interpretations of the Real and thus preserves their individual dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another response to the diversity and plurality of religious beliefs and deities throughout human history is one of [[skepticism]] towards all of them (or even [[antireligion]]), seeing them as illusions or human creations which serve human psychological needs.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 2007, pp 184&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] was a famous proponent of this view, in various publications such as ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930). According to Freud, "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

While one can be skeptical towards the claims of religion, one need not be hostile towards religion. [[Don Cupitt]] is one example of someone who, while disbelieving in the metaphysical and cosmological claims of his religion, holds that one can practice it with a "non-realist" perspective which sees religious claims as human inventions and myths to live by.&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious language===
{{Main Article|Problem of religious language}}
The question of religious language and in what sense it can be said to be meaningful has been a central issue of the philosophy of religion since the work of the [[Vienna circle]], a group of philosophers who, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], put forth the theory of [[Logical positivism]]. Their view was that religious language, such as any talk of God cannot be verified empirically and thus was ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Brian. An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion 2rd Edition, 1993, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This position has also been termed [[Theological noncognitivism]]. A similar view can be seen in [[David Hume]]'s [[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]], where he  famously wrote that any work which did not include either (1) abstract reasoning on quantity or number or (2) reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence was "nothing but sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kvanvig|first=Jonathan L.|title=Faith and Humility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yv5cDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|year=2018|publisher=OUP Oxford|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-253727-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Antony Flew]], questioned the validity of religious statements because they do not seem to be [[falsifiable]], that is, religious claims do not seem to allow any counter evidence to count against them and thus they seem to be lacking in content.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; While such arguments were popular in the 1950s and 60s, the [[verification principle]] and [[falsifiability]] as a criterion for meaning are no longer as widely held.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem with verificationism is that it seems to be self refuting, for it is a claim which does not seem to be supported by its own criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[Brian Davies (philosopher)|Brian Davies]], when talking about God and religious truths, religious traditions tend to resort to [[metaphor]], negation and [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[via negativa]] has been defended by thinkers such as [[Maimonides]] who denied that positive statements about God were helpful and wrote: "you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches based on negation can be seen in the Hindu doctrine of [[Neti neti]] and the Buddhist philosophy of [[Madhyamaka]]. 

[[Wittgenstein]]'s theory of [[language games]] also shows how one can use analogical religious language to describe God or religious truths, even if the words one is using do not in this case refer to their everyday sense, i.e. when we say God is wise, we do not mean he is wise in the same sense that a person is wise, yet it can still make sense to talk in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Patrick Sherry notes, the fact that this sort of language may make sense does not mean that one is warranted in ascribing these terms to God, for there must be some connection between the relevant criteria we use in ascribing these terms to conventional objects or subjects and to God.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1993, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; As Chad Meister notes though, for Wittgenstein, a religion's [[language game]] need not reflect some literal picture of reality (as a [[picture theory of meaning]] would hold) but is useful simply because its ability to "reflect the practices and forms of life of the various religious adherents."&lt;ref&gt;Meister 2009, p. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Wittgenstein, philosophers of religion like [[Norman Malcolm]], [[B. R. Tilghman]], and [[D. Z. Phillips]] have argued that instead of seeing religious language as referring to some objective reality, we should instead see it as referring to ''forms of life''. This approach is generally termed non-realist.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this view, realists respond that non-realism subverts religious belief and the intelligibility of religious practice. It is hard to see for example, how one can pray to a God without believing that they really exist. Realists also argue that non-realism provides no normative way to choose between competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;Taliaferro, Charles, "Philosophy of Religion", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/philosophy-religion/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy of religion==
In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', James Franklin Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref name=harris2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1402005305 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages)  (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, ISSN 1568-1556)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists view) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934-36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'' articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collapse of [[logical positivism]] renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], Alvin Plantinga, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-open classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''&lt;/ref&gt; Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Using first-hand remarks (which would later be published in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition" and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D. Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them."&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian Fideism," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and [[D.Z. Phillips]] became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prostate massage''' is the [[massage]] or stimulation of the male [[prostate]] gland for medical purposes or [[sexual stimulation]].

The prostate takes part in the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], and is essential for the production of [[semen]]. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the [[rectum]] or externally via the [[perineum]].

==Medical uses==

===Digital rectal examination (DRE)===
Prostate massage is part of the digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) routinely given to men by [[urologists]] in order to look for nodules of [[prostate cancer]] and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for [[microscopy]] and [[microbiological culture]] to screen for [[prostatitis]].

====Therapy for prostatitis====
{{Main article|Prostatitis}}
In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of [[Prostatitis#Category II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis|chronic bacterial prostatitis]] with uncertain results.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Downey J, Feliciano AE, Hennenfent B |title=Repetitive prostatic massage therapy for chronic refractory prostatitis: the Philippine experience |journal=Techniques in Urology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=146–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10527258 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoskes DA, Zeitlin SI |title=Use of prostatic massage in combination with antibiotics in the treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal= Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases|volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159–162 |year=1999 |pmid=12496826 |doi=10.1038/sj.pcan.4500308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ateya A, Fayez A, Hani R, Zohdy W, Gabbar MA, Shamloul R |title=Evaluation of prostatic massage in treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal=Urology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=674–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16566972 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in [[western medicine]] for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should ''never'' be performed on patients with [[Prostatitis#Category I: Acute prostatitis (bacterial)|acute prostatitis]], because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.&lt;ref name="pmid10584615"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel JC |title=Prostatitis: evolving management strategies |journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=737–51 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10584615 |doi= 10.1016/S0094-0143(05)70215-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pmid10374787"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Alexander R, Anderson R, Krieger J, Moon T, Neal D, Schaeffer A, Shoskes D |title=[Prostatitis unplugged? Prostatic massage revisited.] |journal=Tech Urol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10374787 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"/&gt; In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"/&gt;

The practice is still used in some parts of China.&lt;ref name="pmid18597833"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Liu L, Xie HW, Ginsberg DA |title=Chinese urologists' practice patterns of diagnosing and treating chronic prostatitis: a questionnaire survey |journal=Urology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=548–51 |year=2008 |pmid=18597833 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2008.03.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences:  periprostatic [[hemorrhage]],&lt;ref name="pmid14655640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buse S, Warzinek T, Hobi C, Ackerman D |title=[Prostate massage with unwanted consequences.

===Electroejaculation===
[[Electroejaculation]] is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in [[animal husbandry]] for the purpose of [[semen collection|collecting semen samples]] for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of [[anejaculation]].&lt;ref name="human-electroej"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |title=Electroejaculation |accessdate=2014-10-24 |publisher=Cornell Urology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510030803/https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.

==As a sexual practice==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===General===
Prostate massage is also used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasms through [[prostate]] stimulation alone.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple Orgasms in Men—What We Know So Far|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293195654|last1=Wibowo|first1=Erik|last2=Wassersug|first2=Richard J.|year=2016|journal=Sexual Medicine Reviews|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.sxmr.2015.12.004|pmid=27872023|pages=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive [[anal intercourse]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce a stronger, more powerful, and "deeper" orgasm than solely penile stimulation, described by some men as more widespread, intense, and enduring, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Lewin, Leap"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ellen Lewin, William Leap, William L. Leap|title=Out in Theory: The Emergence of Lesbian and Gay Anthropology|isbn =978-0252070761|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2002|pages=215–216|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S02nNWBC3bMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostate massage may also be a sexual practice in couples' sexual lives, although not as common. The availability of equipment and products for prostate massage can encourage people to try it. Many couples, though, do not purchase such devices but use a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation to enhance the man's orgasm. The finger or the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged. The main problem in using the finger is that it may be too short to reach the prostate gland. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.

There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is very important to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to evacuate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.&lt;ref name="Ask Alice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate |title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
A ''prostate massager'' is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via [[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive [[massage]], or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.

Prostate massage equipment ranges from [[dildo]]s to [[butt plug]]s and [[G-Spot vibrator]]s.  When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as "prostate toys", "prostate [[sex toys]]", and "anal toys". These prostate massagers are inserted into the [[rectum]] through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during [[foreplay]] by many couples.

Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject's personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and 'lost' inside the rectum.

Some men prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, can be inserted freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as [[masturbation]]. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate.  Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Helix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|title=Aneros Helix|accessdate=2010-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401063732/http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|archivedate=1 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum.  While many massagers rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.

A G-spot vibrator can be used as a prostate massager as long as it is handled carefully and is provided with a safety base that will not allow it to be lost in the rectum. Vibrators for prostate stimulation usually have a pronounced curve at the end.

It overcomes the shortcomings of [[diversity index|biodiversity indices]] that cannot display the relative role different variables played in their calculation.

[[Image:Rank abundance chart.JPG|thumb|A rank abundance curve]]

The curve is a 2D chart with relative abundance on the Y-axis and the abundance rank on the X-axis.
* X-axis: The abundance rank. The most abundant species is given rank 1, the second most abundant is 2 and so on.
* Y-axis: The relative abundance. Usually measured on a log scale, this is a measure of a species abundance (e.g., the number of individuals) relative to the abundance of other species.

==Interpreting a rank abundance curve==
The rank abundance curve visually depicts both species richness and species evenness. Species richness can be viewed as the number of different species on the chart i.e., how many species were ranked. Species evenness is reflected in the slope of the line that fits the graph (assuming a linear, i.e. logarithmic series, relationship). A steep gradient indicates low evenness as the high-ranking species have much higher abundances than the low-ranking species. A shallow gradient indicates high evenness as the abundances of different species are similar.

==Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves==
Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves of different communities can be done using RADanalysis package in [[R (programming language)|R]]. This package uses the [[max rank normalization]] method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Saeedghalati | first1 = M. | title = Quantitative Comparison of Abundance Structures of Generalized Communities: From B-Cell Receptor Repertoires to Microbiomes | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005362 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a rank abundance distribution is made by normalization of rank abundance curves of communities to the same number of ranks and then normalize the relative abundances to one.

'''''Rape Culture''''' is a 1975 film by [[Cambridge Documentary Films]], produced by [[Margaret Lazarus]] and [[Renner Wunderlich]]. It was updated in 1983.&lt;ref name="camdocfilm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Culture|url=http://www.cambridgedocumentaryfilms.org/rapeculture.html|publisher=Cambridge Documentary Films|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, Judy Norsigan outlined how the film illustrated "[[rape culture]]", through the voices of men and women, including rapists, victims, prisoners, rape crisis workers, and the media.&lt;ref name="Norsigian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norsigian|first=Judy|title=Women, Health, and Films|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=20 January 1975|volume=1|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.1300/J013v01n01_07|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J013v01n01_08#preview|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film featured prisoners of [[Lorton Reformatory]], Virginia, "Prisoners Against Rape Inc" (PAR), a not-for-profit organization founded by William Fuller and Larry Cannon on September 9, 1973, in conjunction with women fighting rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=William|author2=Larry Cannon |title=Prisoners Against Rape|journal=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter and Aegis: Magazine on Ending Violence Against Women|date=Sep–Oct 1974|url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/sepoct_74/prisoner_sepoct74.html|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prisoners Against Rape|title=Prisoners Against Rape|journal=Crime and social justice, Issues 1-8|year=1974|volume=1|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prison administration "approved" self-help status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous Author for the Black Panther Newspaper|title=Lorton Organizes Prisoners Against Rape|url=http://solomon.bltc.alexanderstreet.com/cgi-bin/asp/philo/bltc/getdoc.pl?S14062-D021|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=Black Panther|date=March 22, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAR was set up after Fuller wrote to the DC Rape Crisis Center in 1973 and asked for assistance. The DC Rape Crisis Center had opened in 1972 in response to the high incidence of rape against women of color. Fuller acknowledged his history of rape, murder, and prison rape. He wanted to stop being a rapist. This resulted in a cooperative effort.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Follet|first=Joyce|title=LORETTA ROSS|journal=Voices of Feminism Oral History Project, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063|year=2004–2005|pages=122–124|url=http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/vof-intro.html|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women from the DC Rape Crisis Center who initiated work with PAR were Loretta Ross, Yulanda Ward and Nkenge Toure.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Ross has said that whilst the relationship was seen initially as controversial, it was one of the more interesting aspects of her work at the DC Rape Crisis Center in the 1970s and 80s. In an interview with Joyce Follet, Ross observed that in the work of the DC Rape Crisis center they could bandage up women all they wanted to, but if they did not stop rape what was the point?&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Maragaret lazarus, the film's producer, said of this relationship that the work was "groundbreaking".&lt;ref name="lazarus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazarus|first=Margaret|title=Rape Culture|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/rapeculture2.html|publisher=Women's Studies Online Resources|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film featured [[Mary Daly]], radical feminist philosopher, academic, and theologian, and Author and Artist Emily Culpepper. They discussed rapism as an intellectual concept, and phallocentric morality and "its 'unholy trinity of rape, genocide and war.'".&lt;ref name="Norsigian" /&gt;&lt;!-- The Norsigian quote may look odd due to double quotation marks, but it is a direct quote from the source text which can be checked - see notes on talk page --&gt;

Doreen McDowell, a rape victim, talked of her experience, how sex fantasies play a part in rape, and how male identified behavior in women maintained a "state of siege". Powerful statistical evidence, refuting rape myths, law enforcement and legislative views of rape were presented by Joanna Morris, author and statistical coordinator for rape crisis centers across the USA.

The film also looked closely at the mass media, how filmmakers, songwriters, writers and magazines perpetuated the attitudes to rape, which normalized it and even perpetuated rape myths and stereotypical behavior around rape. ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Frenzy]]'', and ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine were some of the media used to illustrate the normalization of rape.

In describing the film, the producers say that it attempts to give real and accurate limits to rape and expand society's narrow and sexist concepts of rape.&lt;ref name="camdocfilm" /&gt;

Lazarus has said of the film's title that it came from long discussion about what the film was trying to illustrate. She has also expressed the view that the film is the first time "[[rape culture]]" was used in its widest accepted sense.&lt;ref name="lazarus" /&gt; A mention of the film in the [[Congressional Record]] in January 1978 is the first known occurrence of the term 'rape culture' in national-level American politics.&lt;ref name="CongressRecordJan1978Hearings"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015081118591;view=1up;seq=680 | title=RESEARCH INTO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR: OVERVIEW AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS HEARINGS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PLANNING, ANALYSIS AND COOPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NINETY-FIFTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION JANUARY 10, 11, 12, 1978 [No 64] | journal=Congressional Record |date=January 1978  | pages=676 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OdXtdf9g | archivedate=6 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10225">A '''reference dose''' is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s maximum acceptable oral [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of a [[toxic]] substance. Reference doses are most commonly determined for [[pesticide]]s. The EPA defines an oral reference dose (abbreviated '''RfD''') as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n estimate, with uncertainty spanning perhaps an [[order of magnitude]], of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ofmpub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/glossariesandkeywordlists/search.do?details=&amp;glossaryName=IRIS%20Glossary IRIS Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Regulatory status==
Unlike [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]], RfDs are not enforceable standards. Instead, the EPA uses RfDs as [[risk assessment]] benchmarks and tries to set other regulations so that people are not exposed to chemicals in amounts that exceed RfDs. According to the EPA, "[a]n aggregate daily exposure to a [chemical] at or below the RfD (expressed as 100 percent or less of the RfD) is generally considered acceptable by EPA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/0328red.pdf Reregistration Eligibility Decision for 1,3-Dichloropropene]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the EPA set an acute RfD for children of 0.0015&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day for the [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] [[endosulfan]], based on neurological effects observed in test animals. The EPA then looked at dietary exposure to endosulfan, and found that for the most exposed 0.1% of children age 1–6, their daily consumption of the endosulfan exceeded this RfD. To remedy this, the EPA revoked the use of endosulfan on the crops that contributed the most to exposure of children: certain beans, peas, spinach, and grapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/endosulfan_red.pdf Reregistration Eliligibility Decision for Endosulfan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Reference doses are chemical-specific, ''i.e.'' the EPA determines a unique reference dose for every substance it evaluates. Often separate [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] RfDs are determined for the same substance. Reference doses are specific to dietary exposure. When assessing inhalation exposure, EPA uses "reference concentrations" ('''RfC'''s), instead of RfDs. Note that RfDs apply only to non-cancer effects. When evaluating [[carcinogen]]ic effects, the EPA uses the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* method.

==Determination==
RfDs are usually derived from animal studies. Animals (typically [[rat]]s) are dosed with varying amounts of the substance in question, and the largest dose at which no effects are observed is identified. This dose level is called the "No observable effect level," or NOEL. To account for the fact that humans may be more or less sensitive than the test animal, a 10-fold uncertainty factor is usually applied to the NOEL. This uncertainty factor is called the "interspecies uncertainty factor" or Uf&lt;sub&gt;inter&lt;/sub&gt;. An additional 10-fold uncertainty factor, the "intraspecies uncertainty factor" or Uf&lt;sub&gt;intra&lt;/sub&gt;, is usually applied to account for the fact that some humans may be substantially more sensitive to the effects of substances than others. Additional uncertainty factors may also be applied. In general:

:&lt;math&gt;RfD (mg/kg/day) = {NOEL (mg/kg/day) \over Uf_{inter} * Uf_{intra} * Uf_{other}}&lt;/math&gt;

Frequently, a "[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]" or NOAEL is used in place of a NOEL. If adverse effects are observed at all dose levels tested, then the smallest dose tested, the "[[lowest-observed-adverse-effect level]]" or LOAEL, is used to calculate the RfD. An additional uncertainty factor usually applied in these cases, since the NOAEL, by definition, would be lower than the LOAEL had it been observed. If studies using [[human subject research|human subjects]] are used to determine a RfD, then the interspecies uncertainty factor can be reduced to 1, but generally the 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is retained. Such studies are rare.

==Example==
As an example, consider the following determination of the RfD for the insecticide [[chlorpyrifos]], adapted from the EPA's Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for chlorpyrifos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/chlorpyrifos_ired.pdf Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for Chlorpyrifos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA determined the '''acute RfD''' to be 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day based on a study in which male rats were administered a one-time dose of chlorpyrifos and blood [[cholinesterase]] activity was monitored. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, the lowest of which was 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. This level was thus identified at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). A NOAEL of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg was estimated by dividing the LOAEL by a three-fold uncertainty factor. The NOAEL was then divided by the standard 10-fold inter- and 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factors to arrive at the RfD of 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day. Other studies showed that fetuses and children are even more sensitive to chlorpyrifos than adults, so the EPA applies an additional ten-fold uncertainty factor to protect that subpopulation. A RfD that has been divided by an additional uncertainty factor that only applies to certain populations is called a "population adjusted dose" or PAD. For chlorpyrifos, the acute PAD (or "aPAD") is thus 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day, and it applies to infants, children, and women who are breast feeding.

The EPA also determined a '''chronic RfD''' for chlorpyrifos exposure based on studies in which animals were administered low doses of the pesticide for two years. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, and a NOAEL of 0.03&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day estimated by dividing a LOAEL of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day by an uncertainty factor of 10. As with the acute RfD, the chronic RfD of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day was determined by dividing this NOAEL by the inter- and intraspecies uncertainty factors. The chronic PAD ("cPAD") of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day was determined by applying an additional 10-fold uncertainty factor to account for the increased susceptibility of infants and children. Like the aPAD, this cPAD applies to infants, children, and breast feeding women.

==Consensus==
Because the RfD assumes "a dose below which no adverse noncarcinogenic health effects should result from a lifetime of exposure",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/uic/class5/pdf/study_uic-class5_classvstudy_mcl-ha_appd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the critical step in all chemical risk and regulatory threshold calculations is dependent upon a properly derived dose at which no observed adverse effects (NOAEL) were seen which is then divided by an uncertainty factor that considers inadequacies of the study, animal-to-human extrapolation, sensitive sub-populations, and inadequacies of the database.  The RfD that is derived is not always agreed upon.  Some may believe it to be overly protective while others may contend that it is not adequately protective of human health.

For example, the EPA completed its draft toxicological review of perchlorate in 2002 and proposed an RfD of 0.00003 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) based primarily on studies that identified neurodevelopmental deficits in rat pups. These deficits were linked to maternal exposure to perchlorate. Subsequently, the National Academy of Science (NAS) reviewed the health implications of perchlorate, and in 2005 proposed an alternative reference dose of 0.0007&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day based primarily on a 2002 study by Greer et al.&lt;ref&gt;Greer M A, Goodman G, Pleus R C, and S E Greer. (2002) Health Effects Assessment for Environmental Perchlorate Contamination: The Dose Response for Inhibition of Thyroidal Radioiodine Uptake in Humans. Environmental Health Perspectives (110)9: 927-37.&lt;/ref&gt; During that study, 37 human subjects were split into four exposure groups exposed to 0.007 (7 subjects), 0.02 (10 subjects), 0.1 (10 subjects), and 0.5 (10 subjects) mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in iodide uptake were found in the three highest exposure groups. Iodide uptake was not significantly reduced in the lowest exposed group, but four of the seven subjects in this group experienced inhibited iodide uptake. The RfD proposed by NAS was accepted by EPA and added to its integrated risk information system (IRIS) in 2005.

Ginsberg and Rice, in a commentary submitted to the journal ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' (EHP), argued that the 2005 NAS RfD was not protective of human health based on the following:

# The NAS report described the level of lowest exposure from Greer ''et al'' as a NOEL. However, there was actually an effect at that level although not statistically significant largely due to small size of study population (four of seven subjects showed a slight decrease in iodide uptake).
# Reduced iodide uptake was not considered to be an adverse effect. However, it is a precursor to an adverse effect (hypothyroidism). Therefore, additional safety factors, they argued, are necessary when extrapolating from the point of departure to the RfD.
# Consideration of data uncertainty was insufficient because the Greer, et al. study reflected only a 14-day exposure to healthy adults and no additional safety factors were considered to protect sensitive subpopulations. For example, the potential for greater toxicity to breastfeeding newborns was not considered.

Although there has generally been consensus with the Greer ''et al'' study, there is not consensus with regard to developing a perchlorate RfD. One of the key differences results from how the point of departure is viewed (i.e., NOEL or LOAEL), or whether a benchmark dose should be used to derive the RfD. Defining the point of departure as a NOEL or LOAEL has implications when it comes to applying appropriate safety factors to the point of departure to derive the RfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region10/pdf/sites/euclid/eroad-perchlorate-memo-071307.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

'''Stemettes''' is a [[social enterprise]] which encourages girls aged between 5–22 years old to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, or [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]. Stemettes runs panel events, [[hackathon]]s, the Student to Stemette mentoring programme supported by [[Deutsche Bank]], Outbox Incubator and an app, OtotheB, an online platform for girls interested in STEM and [[entrepreneurship]].

==History==
Stemettes was started in 2013 by British mathematics and computing child prodigy [[Anne-Marie Imafidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Women in Science: Meet the Stemettes star inspiring more girls into STEM|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-science-meet-stemettes-star-inspiring-more-girls-into-stem-1543094|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jacquelyn Guderley became co-founder of Stemettes alongside Imafidon.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - if she joined 2 years after it was started then she cannot be co-founder|date=December 2017}}

Stemettes has partnered with organisations including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Salesforce]], [[Accenture]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[BP]] and [[Microsoft]]. The organisation is regularly called upon by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] and [[European Commission]] to consult on matters related to women in STEM.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Outbox Incubator==
For six weeks from July–August 2015, Stemettes ran Outbox Incubator in London. This residential business incubator for girls with STEM start-ups became known as the “X-men house for girls”&lt;ref&gt;Ravanona, Anna. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-ravanona/inside-outbox-incubator-m_b_8423472.html Inside Outbox Incubator: Meet the Startups Built By Girls in STEM - Part 1], [[The Huffington Post]], 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the Outbox Incubator spin-off app, OtotheB, was officially launched. The app is an online platform for girls interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. The app has been well received by some STEM figures such as academic and campaigner [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], who described the app as a “…fantastic new resource for young women interested in technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, John.

[[File:TheMindOfTheMaker.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]])&lt;br&gt;Cover art by C W B]]

'''''The Mind of the Maker''''' (1941) is a Christian [[Theology|theological]] book, written by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (who was better known for her crime and mystery novels and other fiction, particularly for the character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]). It used the experience she had of literary creativity to illuminate Christian doctrine about the nature of [[Doctrine of the Trinity|the Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mind of the Maker'', preface&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has a Latin dedication to Saint [[Athanasius]] and to British Christian leaders.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Regarded in the [[Christian world]] as something of a classic, it is often quoted.
:''"In The Mind of the Maker, one of her most profound works, Sayers contends that the creative process in art works in ways that correspond to the dynamic relation among the three Persons of the Trinity in Christian theology — and that the activity of one illuminates the activity of the other."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=In God’s Image: The virtue of creativity | last=Wolfe | first=Gregory | work=National Review online | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/wolfe200505270758.asp | date=27 May 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly well received, Sayers' work even finds readers beyond the religious world, such as in the software management book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''.
:''"Dorothy Sayers, in her excellent book, The Mind of the Maker, divides creative activity into three stages: the idea, the implementation, and the interaction. A book, then, or a computer, or a program comes into existence first as an ideal construct, built outside time and space, but complete in the mind of the author. It is realized in time and space, by pen, ink, and paper, or by wire, silicon, and ferrite. The creation is complete when someone reads the book, uses the computer, or runs the program, thereby interacting with the mind of the maker. This description, which Miss Sayers uses to illuminate not only human creative activity but also the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, will help us in our present task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering | last=Brookes | first=Frederick P. jr. | work= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4468/The-Mythical-ManMonth-Essays-on-Software-Engineering-20th-Anniversary-Ed-1995- | date=1975 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toxgnostics''' is part of [[Personalized medicine]] as it describes the guiding principles for the discovery of [[pharmacogenomic]] biomarker tests, also referred to as [[companion diagnostic]] tests, which identify if an individual patient is likely to suffer severe drug toxicity from treatment with a specific therapeutic agent. Once at risk individuals are identified drug toxicity can be prevented using elective dose reduction or prescription of an alternative medication.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics&gt;Church D, Kerr R, Domingo E, Rosmarin D, Palles C, Maskell K, Tomlinson I, Kerr D (2014). "'Toxgnostics': an unmet need in cancer medicine". Nat Rev Cancer (6):440-5. doi:10.1038/nrc3729. {{PMID|24827503}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson R, Newport R, Kerr R, Kerr DJ (2014). "Toxgnostics:predicting and preventing chemotherapy-induced side effects." Personalised Medicine 11 (7):683-685. doi:10.2217/pme.14.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830384Kerr DJ Kerr. "Chemo Safety: Can Biomarkers Help?". Medscape Oncology, Kerr on Oncology. 28 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The majority of toxgnostic studies have been candidate gene studies restricted to the known Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion genes ([[ADME]]) of drug treated patients.  The PharmaADME consortium&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmaadme.org/joomla/ PharmaADME consortium. Michael S. Phillips Ph.D. Retrieved 30 Dec 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; identified 32 core genes containing 184 variants within common pathways that should be included in ADME candidate gene studies of toxicity biomarkers. Toxicity biomarkers that have been clinically validated using this restricted panel of genes include the [[P450 cytochrome]] assay that is currently recommended for routine clinical use of the oral anticoagulant warfarin. Using [[next-generation sequencing]] methods and [[genome-wide association studies]] a more comprehensive toxgnostic approach can be utilized through unbiased analysis of several million variants across the whole human genome, including introns and exons, for pharmacogenomic markers of drug induced toxicity.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;

Cancer drugs have been highlighted as particularly appropriate candidates for toxgnostic studies due to the significant toxicity profiles associated with both targeted therapies&lt;ref&gt;Widakowich C, de Castro G Jr, de Azambuja E, Dinh P, Awada A (2007). "Review: Side Effects of Approved Molecular Targeted Therapies in Solid Cancers". Oncologist (12):1443–1455.{{PMID|18165622}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Walko CM, McLeod H (2009). "Pharmacogenomic progress in individualized dosing of key drugs for cancer patients". Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (6):153-162.
doi:10.1038/ncponc1303.&lt;/ref&gt; Most cancer patients obtain only modest benefit from treatment, whereas toxicity is common and often associated with severe side effects which include considerable morbidity and mortality. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs [[5-fluorouracil]] (5FU) prescribed as [[adjuvant therapy]] following surgical resection of early stage [[colorectal cancer]] benefits only approx. 4% of patients, whereas 30–40% of those treated will suffer severe toxicity such as [[neutropenia]], [[mucositis]], [[hand-foot syndrome]], [[diarrhoea]], and [[stomatitis]], fatal toxicities will kill 0.5-1% of people treated.&lt;ref&gt;Quasar Collaborative Group, Gray R, Barnwell J, McConkey C, Hills RK, Williams NS, Kerr, DJ (2007)"Adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomised study." Lancet 370: 2020–2029. {{PMID|18083404}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of toxgnostic screens a number of genetic variants have now been identified that can be used to predict 5FU toxicity prior to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosmarin D, Palles C, Pagnamenta A, Kaur K, Pita G, Martin M, Domingo E, Jones A, Howarth K, Freeman-Mills L, Johnstone E, Wang H, Love S, Scudder C, Julier P, Fernández-Rozadilla C, Ruiz-Ponte C, Carracedo A, Castellvi-Bel S, Castells A, Gonzalez-Neira A, Taylor J, Kerr R, Kerr D, Tomlinson I (2014). Gut. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306571. {{PMID|24647007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genetic variants can be used to identify the individuals predisposed to severe drug toxicity and the dose of 5FU chemotherapy can be reduced to prevent severe toxic side effects. Toxgnostic biomarker tests currently available for use in clinical practice include markers for [[irinotecan]], [[thioguanine]], [[warfarin]] and [[5FU]].

== Toxgnostic principles ==

Toxgnostic studies are defined by four key elements:&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;
# Analysis should be embedded within large, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials (i.e. [[Phase III clinical trials]])
# The phenotype of interest should be clinically relevant and clearly defined using internationally standardized criteria and systematically captured such as the US [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) [[Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events]] (CTCAE) grade 3–5 toxicity.
# Analysis should be unbiased to encompass the maximum relevant genomic diversity, rather than being limited by what is often a superficial understanding of the pathways involved in the [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]] of the agent.
# The performance of individual variants should be compared with that of a combined risk score, which may outperform each individual variant when they are analysed separately.

Appropriate analytical approaches for toxgnostic studies include [[candidate gene]] studies, [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] and [[whole genome sequencing]]. GWAS and whole genome sequencing are the most comprehensive approaches though careful considerations must be applied to the relevance, analysis and interpretation of the results to prevent over-fitting, which produces false-positive results, a proposed GWAS workflow is shown below.&lt;ref name=Toxgnostics /&gt;

== Regulatory oversight of toxgnostic tests ==

Toxicity biomarkers can be co-developed and co-approved with the respective drug as a [[companion diagnostic test]], this requires [[premarket approval]] (PMA). The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) IVD Companion Diagnostic Device guidance issued in draft 14 July 2011 states that a companion diagnostic test can be used to “Identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM262327.pdf |title=Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there are guidleines for the submission of pharmacogenomic studies from the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm126957.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901130414/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126957.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and draft guidance from the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2014/01/WC500160232.pdf |title=Guidance |date=10 January 2014 |website=www.ema.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Type''' followed by a number is a common way to name a weapon or product in a production series, similar in meaning to "[[Mark (designation)|Mark]]". "Type" was used extensively by the Japanese and Chinese militaries beginning in the 1920s, and is still in current use by the militaries of both nations. The United Kingdom uses a '''type number system''' for much of their military equipment. Many other nations use the word "Type" to designate products in a series.

==Japan==
The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) began using the Type-Number System in 1921 to designate aircraft accepted for production. The numbers used after the word "Type" were based on the number of years that the [[Emperor Taishō]] had reigned. Since his reign began in 1912, an aircraft ordered into production in 1921 would have been called "Type 10", the tenth year of the emperor's reign. At the end of 1926, the emperor died, leaving his son [[Hirohito]] as the Emperor Shōwa, and the numbering system was reset to mark the new emperor's reign.&lt;ref name=Peattie&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Zero Akagi Dec1941.jpg|thumb|The Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter.]]
In 1929, the government of Japan adopted a new system based on the [[Japanese_era_name#Imperial_year|imperial year]].&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt; Aircraft ordered for production from 1929 onward were assigned the last two digits of the year marking the continuity of Japanese emperors. 1929 was the 2589th imperial year, so aircraft ordered that year were designated "Type 89". 1940 was the 2600th year, and the IJN numbering system was reset to single digits. New aircraft were designated [[0 (number)|0 (zero)]]. The well-known Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the IJN "Type 0 Carrier Fighter" (''Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki'', 零式艦上戦闘機), and was popularly called the "Zero" because of its type.&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt;

In 1943, the designation system was abandoned by the IJN as it was considered too revealing about the nature of the aircraft. In its place, the aircraft were named with popular terms such as ''Kyōfū'' (強風 "Strong Wind") for the [[Kawanishi N1K]] introduced in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred T. Jane|Jane, Frederick Thomas]]. ''Jane's all the world's aircraft, Volume 34'', p. 155c, Jane's Information Group, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) began using the Type designation system in 1927, for all weapons, vehicles, military equipment, subassemblies and subsystems such as engines and gunmounts. In 1940, instead of resetting to zero, the IJA assigned "Type 100" to equipment put into production that year. In 1941, the IJA reset to "Type 1". Unlike the IJN, the IJA continued to use the system through 1945 with the production of the [[Kawasaki Ki-100]] Army Type 5 Fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, J. (2008) History of War. [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_japanese_army_aircraft_designations.html ''Japanese Army Air Force Designations of the Second World War''.] Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, Japan's military changed to a numbering system based on the Japanese fiscal year which begins on April 1 in the same manner as the British fiscal year. As an example, "Type 63" was the designation for equipment such as the [[Type 63 AT mine]] accepted in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xl, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kanji]] character ''shiki'' (式) is what the Japanese use to designate products in a series. The [[English language]] translation of ''shiki'' has been variously given as "model" or "type".&lt;ref name=Easterly&gt;Easterly, William M. P. (June 2009) [http://www.dragonsoffire.com/ARTICLE:--MODEL---TYPE.php ''Dragons of Fire'', "Model/Type"]. Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some manuals and texts have translated ''shiki'' as both "model" and "type" within the same publication, confusing the matter. [[World War II]]-era military dictionaries do not give ''shiki'' as the Japanese word for "model"—instead, the kanji character ''kata'' is given. In turn, ''kata'' (型 or 形) is translated as "form", "type", "pattern", "mark", or "model". The only [[Japanese language]] translation given for the English word "type" is ''shiki''.&lt;ref name=Easterly/&gt;

==China==
Chinese weapons and military vehicles are often, but not always, designated according to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the one used by most nations. Two digits are used to designate the year. The two digits appear first, followed by the character ''shi'', meaning "type".&lt;ref&gt;Blasko, Dennis J. ''The Chinese Army today: tradition and transformation for the 21st century'', p. 122. Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|0-415-77003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, in 1956, the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] was put into production, and the [[Type 64 pistol]] was designed and approved in 1964.

==United Kingdom==
The [[Royal Navy]] uses a type number system where blocks of numbers are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, the block 900–999 was given to naval radar sets beginning in 1945 and continuing for roughly 20 years. Numbers are not always sequential, as the Type 992 target indication radar was developed long before the Type 967 target designation radar. When a reserved block has been fully utilized, another is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xli, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">The study of '''real estate''' at the undergraduate level is commonly contained as a degree of Bachelor of Science in Real Estate or a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in real estate.  A very limited number of universities offer a full "Bachelor of Science in Real Estate" and have "Real Estate" departments in their respective Colleges within the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cob.fsu.edu/content/download/169088/1479911/file/REE-2014-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bus.wisc.edu/bba/academics-and-programs/majors/real-estate|title=Real Estate|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the maturity of [[Graduate real estate education|Master of Real Estate Development]] programs, universities are now looking at also offering specialized undergraduate education in real estate.

Many of the programs ranked by ''U.S. News and World Report'' are Bachelor of Business Administration or Bachelor of Science programs though some, such as [[University of Florida]], [[Cornell University]], and [[University of Illinois]], only offer minors in Real Estate or majors in Finance "with emphasis in Real Estate".&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warrington.ufl.edu/departments/fire/|title=Department of Finance, Insurance &amp; Real Estate - Warrington|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.illinois.edu/finance/courses9.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; While business schools continue to attract future real estate professionals, many critics of business education have many complaints. Some say the schools have become too scientific, too detached from real-world issues. Others say students are taught to come up with hasty solutions to complicated problems. Another group contends that schools give students a limited and distorted view of their role - that they graduate with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and only a limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to business leadership. Such shortcomings may have left business school graduates inadequately prepared to make the decisions that, taken together, might have helped mitigate the financial and real estate crisis, critics say.&lt;ref&gt;http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/fpposted/archive/2010/03/17/why-a-liberal-arts-education-can-best-prepare-business-leaders.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative course of study to an undergraduate degree in business or real estate is the liberal arts, such as [[economics]], [[public administration]], [[urban planning]], or [[geography]].  An aspiring real estate professional may supplement his education with a [[Master of Real Estate Development]] degree, a common prerequisite for many institutional and corporate real estate firms.

==Business school rankings==

The [[U.S. News and World Report]] ranks the top 13 undergraduate programs which offer a study in real estate.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-real-estate&lt;/ref&gt; However, many schools on the U.S. News and World Reports list (University of Florida&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"/&gt; and Cornell University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/academics/degree-requirements/concentrations-minors/real-estate-minor.html|title=Undergraduate Minor in Real Estate - Cornell SHA|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example)  do not actually offer undergraduate degrees (majors) in Real Estate, and alternatively run a "focus" or "minor" in Real Estate under their Finance departments.  Additionally there are many non-business schools that offer other real estate related degrees.

[[File:Abc-engine.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1921 [[ABC Motorcycle|ABC]] [[Flat-twin|opposed twin]] unit construction engine / transmission]]
[[File:R32-engine.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1923 [[BMW motorcycles|BMW]] R32 unit construction engine / transmission]]

'''Unit construction''' is the design of larger [[motorcycle]]s where the [[engine]] and [[gearbox]] components share a single casing. This sometimes includes the design of [[automobile]] engines and was often loosely applied to motorcycles with rather different internal layouts such as the [[flat twin]] [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] models. 

Prior to unit construction, the engine and gearbox had their own separate casings and were connected by a primary chain drive running in an oil bath chaincase. The new system used a similar chain drive and both had 3 separate oil reservoirs for engine, gearbox and primary drive.

Triumph and BSA were already using cast alloy chaincases and started converting to unit construction in the 1950s.  A driving factor behind the BSA/Triumph change was that [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]]&lt;ref&gt; Lucas was then the major British manufacturer of automotive electric components.&lt;/ref&gt; had declared an intention to abandon production of motorcycle [[dynamo]]s and [[ignition magneto|magneto]]s, and instead produce only [[alternator]]s. By contrast, Velocette, Matchless/AJS and Norton motorcycles continued to be [[pre-unit construction]] (the former machines with pressed-steel primary cases) until the end of production in the 1960s and 1970s respectively. In reality, the casings were not really "unitary", as the crankcase section was vertically divided in the middle and no oil was shared between the three portions. Only in the 1960s did Japanese motorcycles introduce the now- familiar horizontally-split clam-shell which has become almost universal. 

Modern horizontally-split [[four stroke]] engines invariably use single oil reservoir (whether wet- or [[dry sump|dry-sump]]; but while this simplifies matters, it is arguable that the previous system of having different types of oil for engine and gearbox is preferable.  The [[BMC Mini]] was an early example of a car with the "gearbox-in-the-sump"; but this practice of using a single oil reservoir, which has become the norm for motorbikes, is generally undesirable for cars and trucks. [[Two stroke]] "total-loss" bikes always have separate oil for the gearbox, as engine oil is burned along with the fuel.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
The advantages of unit construction are:
*the combined unit contributes to the stiffness of the entire motorcycle.
*the primary chain case can be lighter and more compact.
*the primary chain case can be shorter, so that wheelbase may also be shorter
*engine and transmission are now much more accurately aligned to each other in the frame, improving primary drive life.
*the engine is cleaner in appearance and fashionably modern compared to earlier designs.

A significant disadvantage is that there is no longer any tension adjustment possible of the chain drive between engine and transmission, and tensioning (which is almost certainly still required) must be over a rubber-faced steel slipper. However, this is quieter and the tensioner does not wear greatly. The change to unit construction marked the end of choosing a gearbox from another manufacturer (e.g. a close-ratio unit for racing) and sending worn gear-box units to specialist re-builders.

==History==
===Early history===
Alfred Angas Scott, founder of [[The Scott Motorcycle Company]], designed a motorcycle with unit construction for the engine and gearbox. Production of the motorcycle began in 1908.&lt;ref name="yorkshire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoveringyorkshire.net/Trail.aspx?id=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165133/http://www.discoveringyorkshire.net/Trail.aspx?id=2 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }} DiscoveringYorkshire ''Scott's early motorcycle developments'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[Singer (car)|Singer]] offered motorcycles with unit-construction 299&amp;nbsp;cc and 535&amp;nbsp;cc engines.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_s.html] IanChadwick ''Brit Bikes S'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, [[ABC Motorcycle|ABC]] founder [[Granville Bradshaw]] designed a unit-construction horizontally opposed ('flat') twin for Sopwith Aircraft, who, at the time, also made motorcycles.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_a.html] IanChadwick ''Brit Bikes A'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[Rover (car)|Rover]] introduced a 250&amp;nbsp;cc unit-construction model, followed by a 350&amp;nbsp;cc in 1924, but production ended in 1925.&lt;ref name="r"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_r.html] IanChadwick ''Brit Bikes R'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the advanced three-speed [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] single-cylinder 346&amp;nbsp;cc sv unit-construction Model LS appeared, but did not sell well, and ended production in 1927.&lt;ref name="Triumph Time2"/&gt;

In 1923, [[BMW]] released its own unit construction shaft drive flat twin of 498&amp;nbsp;cc. BMW has never built a motorcycle with a separate gearbox.&lt;ref&gt;Title: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, Editor: Erwin Tragatsch, Publisher: New Burlington Books, Copyright: 1979 Quarto Publishing, Edition: 1988 Revised, Page 89, {{ISBN|0-906286-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924, [[FN (motorcycle)|FN]] single-cylinder engines changed from semi unit construction (as seen in the last semi-unit single, the 1922 FN 285TT, in its last year of sale in 1924,) to unit construction engines (as seen in the new-for-1924 M.60).&lt;ref name="Mid"&gt;[http://users.pandora.be/FN.oldtimers/fn_1924-45_.htm] FN History 1924 - 1945 (Retrieved 13 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] made their first and only two-stroke, a 175&amp;nbsp;cc unit construction bike, for only one season, otherwise four-stroke twins became unit construction in 1962.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_b.html] IanChadwick ''Brit Bikes B'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1932, [[New Imperial Motors Ltd|New Imperial]] was known for pioneering innovations in unit construction on motorcycles . They made the Unit Minor 150 and Unit Super 250 in this manner and by 1938 all of their machines were unit construction.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_n.html] IanChadwick ''Brit Bikes N'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemon"&gt;[http://www.is-it-a-lemon.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=783] Is-it-a-lemon ''New Imperial'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 the first unit construction twin cylinder motorcycle made by Triumph, the 350&amp;nbsp;cc (21 ci) 'Twenty One' 3TA, designed by [[Edward Turner]] and Wickes, was introduced for the 21st Anniversary of Triumph Engineering Co. Ltd. Unfortunately it also had the first "bathtub" rear enclosure, which proved a sales failure.&lt;ref name="Triumph Time3"&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time03.html] IanChadwick ''Triumph Time3'' (Retrieved 25 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit singles====
[[File:Bantengine.jpg|left|thumb|[[BSA Bantam]] &lt;br&gt;125&amp;nbsp;cc engine on model D1]]
The [[BSA Bantam]] range of [[two-stroke engine]]s introduced the unit construction concept to BSA since its introduction in 1949. [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] produced their first four-stroke unit construction singles in 1959 when they introduced the [[BSA C15|C15]] to replace the venerable c12 single. The unit construction (in contrast to the separate engine and gearbox of the C10/C11 and c12) gave the family of motorcycles started by this model its familiar name.

The C15 was intended as a utility "get to work" model, and served this purpose faithfully for many thousands of users. It was a simple and reasonably robust design.

Along with the C15 came the B40, the 350&amp;nbsp;cc version. This was no faster than the C15, but had a little more lugging power. A version of the B40 was also produced (in considerable quantities) for various branches of the military. These motorcycles (known as the "Ex-WD B40") were more rugged than the vanilla version (in particular, the timing-side main bearing was over- rather than under-engineered and an oil filter was fitted), slightly de-tuned and given a version of the competition frame. For these reasons, these bikes can make very good buying, and are often used as the basis for competition machines.

Several minor changes were made to the C15 in 7 years (with some variations on the theme - the "warmer" SS80 and SS90, plus competition versions).

In 1967 the model underwent some revisions and a name change to B25. The model then continued with little variation until BSA collapsed in the early 1970s.

The BSA unit single was an affordable introduction to motorcycling for many young men in the 1960s and 1970s. The simple design meant that inexperienced and under-equipped home mechanics could keep them running under most circumstances. The effects of such inexperienced maintenance led to a slightly undeserved reputation for unreliability - a well maintained and regularly serviced unit single will chug along for a very long time with no problems.

The warmer versions (such as the much-loved Starfire) were generally less robust, but their light weight, enjoyable handling and peppy engines meant that many people considered the hours of necessary maintenance a worthwhile trade-off.

Many BSA unit singles were built, meaning there are few 1960s motorcycles with such a large supply of readily available spares. The tunability and ready supply of these motors, combined with their compact and light(ish) construction has also made them a popular choice for modern "Classic" competition.

The BSA design was based on the [[Triumph Tiger Cub]], first produced in 1952. The continuation of the model until 1973 speaks well for the popularity and utility of this design, but also reflects badly on the forward-thinking and investment of the BSA management. By 1967 unit singles were looking slow and rattly and the "charm" of the traditional British oil-leak was wearing thin. The new breed of Japanese motorcycles arriving on the scene were fast and exotic in comparison, and the buying public can certainly not be blamed for their eventual shunning of the entire British motorcycle industry.
