'''Argyle Street''' was a Victorian terraced street in Norwich, Norfolk. It became a [[squatting|squat]] lasting from January 1980 to February 1985 until the street was demolished 1986. 

==History==
A Victorian street consisting of small two up to down terraced houses, according to Morant's map, Argyle Sreet was partly built in 1873; Eyre Bros. 1883-4 Directory lists 106 families and their occupations, mainly manual workers with a significant number of men employed by the railway. Jarrolds Directory of 1889 lists one shopkeeper. It was saved from slum clearance in the early 1960s, after the nearby area of Richmond, or the village on the hill was completely demolished. 

===Slums===
The [[University of East Anglia]] planned to buy the Victorian terraced housing of Argyle Street from [[Norwich City Council]] for student homes in 1979, however, in December of that year a handful of squatters moved in and Britain's longest-running and biggest squat began. In 1980, the squatters formed a [[co-operative]], which was backed by Norwich City Council, which at the time included [[Patricia_Hollis,_Baroness_Hollis_of_Heigham|Pat Hollis]]. Together they applied for a grant from the Government-funded Housing Corporation. In 1981 a £1 million grant was agreed for a major renovation scheme, but in 1982 the [[Department of the Environment]] blocked Norwich City Council's plan to sell or lease the houses to the co-operative.&lt;ref&gt; http://issuu.com/alstokes/docs/argyle_street_&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Revelopment===
In 1984 Norwich City Council decided to demolish the area and develop it for sheltered homes. The final eviction of squatters from Argyle Street occurred in February 1985.&lt;ref&gt; http://issuu.com/alstokes/docs/argyle_street_ &lt;/ref&gt; Some of the redeveloped houses, built in 1986, were demolished in 2015 after subsidence occurred. 

==Legacy==
In 1981 Argyle Street became the setting for scenes of a filmed adaptation of [[Doris Lessing]]'s [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]''.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1766/year/1981.html &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17154">{{short description|An approach to human geography that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach}}
'''Behavioral geography''' is an approach to [[human geography]] that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach. Behavioral geographers focus on the [[cognitive process]]es underlying [[spatial reasoning]], [[decision making]], and [[behavior]]. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of [[behaviorism]] to determine the [[cognitive]] processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Behavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.

==Issues==
Because of the name it is often assumed to have its roots in [[behaviorism]]. While some behavioral geographers clearly have roots in behaviorism&lt;ref name=Norton01&gt;Norton, W. (2001). Initiating an affair human geography and [[behavior analysis]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (4), 283–290 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton02&gt;Norton, W. (2002) Explaining Landscape Change: Group Identity and Behavior. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (2), 155–160 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; due to the emphasis on cognition, most can be seen as cognitively oriented. Indeed, it seems that behaviorism interest is more recent&lt;ref name=Glass07&gt;Glass, J.E. (2007). Behavior analytic grounding of sociological [[social constructionism]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8 (4), 426–433 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; and growing.&lt;ref name=Norton01/&gt; This is particularly true in the area of human landscaping.

Behavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "[[cognitive map]]s". More [[Cognitive geography|cognitively oriented]], behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.&lt;ref name=Norton97&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics.

The approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of [[psychology]], but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[transportation planning]], and many others.

== The Social Construction of Nature ==
[[Nature]] is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. [[Social constructionism|Social Construction]] is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;Gerber, J. (1997). Beyond Dualism — the social construction of nature and the natural ''and'' social construction of human beings. Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.925.2585&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and [[semantics]] possible.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories,  then the human ability to think about it becomes limited.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

The social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist ([[ontology]]) and how truths are justified ([[epistemology]]).&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both [[literal and figurative language|literal]] and [[metaphor]]ical,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Demerit, D. (2002). What is the 'social construction of nature'? A typology and sympathetic critique. Retrieved from https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/SOC165/Demeritt_2002_-_Social_Constr_of_Nature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as through giving it a human quality ([[Mother Nature]]).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Williams, R. (1983). Keyword: A vocabulary of culture and society. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to discredit [[science]] or philosophy.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

As a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes [[environmental ethics]] and [[Value (ethics)|values]], which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the [[natural environment]]. It incorporates ideas from [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[geography]], [[biology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[economics]], and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from [[Western world]] thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other [[world view]]s, such as the [[Traditional knowledge|Traditional Knowledge]] of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically [[ecofeminism]]&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Merchant, C. (2003). Reinventing Eden: The Fate of Nature in Western Culture. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Shiva, V. (1988).

=== The Role of Linguistics ===
[[File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|thumb|Raymond Williams, author of ''Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society (1983)''.]]
There are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; According to [[Raymond Williams]], there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature:
# Nature as a quality, character or process&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. human nature)
# Nature as a force&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. weather)
# Nature as the material world&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. the physical environment)
According to [[Raymond Williams]], language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== The Role of Mental Maps ===
Humans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Lynch, D. (1960). The Image of the City. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences allow us to create [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] where we can create memories associated to space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These images have three parts:
# An identity&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A pattern&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A [[Pragmatism|practical]] or [[emotion]]al meaning&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
According to [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Role of Science ===
[[Science]] occurs at many [[dimension]]s and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Pedynowski, D. (2003). Science(s) - which, when and whose? Probing the metanarrative of scientific knowledge in the social construction of nature. Retrieved from http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=15017498-bcd5-409d-b7ed-3d2141dad610%40sessionmgr101&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific knowledge consists of [[concept]]s and [[analysis]], and is a way to represent nature.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]], a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For [[Carolyn Merchant]], science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Schools of Thought ==

[[Relativism]] is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative:
# [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|Critical Realism]] (being realistic)&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
# [[Pragmatism]] (being practical)&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Critical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on [[social science]] and ethics, instead.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

According to [[Richard Rorty]], relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways:
# Every belief is equally valid&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# There is no criteria for what a truth can be&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That any truth can be justified by the society it comes from&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
According to [[Gilbert White]], pragmatism has four main assumptions:
# That human existence is based on putting labor into the land&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That the idea of owning anything is a [[wikt:conception|conception]]&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That humans learn from their experiences&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That engagement of the publics is what allows for commitments&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Richard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism:
# That all theories characterize some form of truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That there is not difference between what can and should be done when it comes to the truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That knowledge is constrained by the conversations we have&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Being pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

# Using non-human animals to relate to nature ([[Animism]])&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Viewing nature as an '[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]' ([[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]) &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Constructions can also be categorized by giving them meaning through the process of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]],&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; which has three components:
# The '[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]' (the individual)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The practice it originates from (the culture)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# An associated [[Taxon|taxonomic group]] (i.e. [[homo sapiens]])&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
No matter how nature becomes socially constructed, though, the process itself is limited by three dimensions:
# The physical dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The mental dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The social dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
The physical dimension is limited to the human body, where the brain is responsible for creating and selecting thoughts.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The mental dimension is used to understand the physical dimension and is limited to human logic.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The social dimension needs moral and [[social order]] and is used to give meaning to both what is physically present and what is culturally constructed.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; All three dimensions must be present and linked to be able to socially construct nature.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== Criticism on the Social Construction of Nature ==
The social construction of nature has room for improvement in four main areas:
# By giving more importance to how realities are culturally constructed through social interactions&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
# By acknowledging that all science should be analyzed by the same standard&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By gaining a better understanding of the role language plays in constructionism&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By giving more importance to how truths exist and how they are justified, using [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]]&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

[[File:Bellacorick County Mayo Summer 2010.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bellacorick blanket bog June 2010]]

'''Bellacorick''' or '''Bellacoric''' ({{irish place name|Béal Átha Chomhraic|ford mouth of the confluence}}) is a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], Ireland. It comprises an area of {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. The area is remote, virtually uninhabited [[blanket bog]] which was once used mainly for milled peat production. Nowadays, it is a [[Special Area of Conservation]] because of the unique nature of the intact blanket bog habitat. The main [[Belmullet]] to [[Castlebar]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] road passes through this townland.

== History ==
There is virtually no [[arable land]] in this area of lowland blanket bog but in the 19th century the area was leased to a Patrick Burke who housed horses in stables opposite the public house which comprises virtually all of this [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]].  There was a shooting lodge which later became the post office, but this was later moved again to Kilsallagh and there is now no post office in Bellacorick.  There used to be a Garda Station close to the Bridge but it was abandoned around 1940 and the area was policed by Crossmolina.

=== The Musical Bridge ===

[[File:Musical bridge Bellacorick June 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Musical Bridge, Bellacorick]]In about 1820, the civil engineer, [[William Bald]], who was mapping the area and building roads through [[Erris]], designed the Bellacorick Bridge, known as the Musical Bridge, it can be 'played' in two different ways:
* The first way is by rolling a stone along the parapet on either side.  As the stone drops along musical notes are produced in rapid succession.
* The second method is to hold the stone in your hand and to strike it on the slabs which form the coping of the parapet hitting each slab as you go along and drawing back the hand immediately after striking.  Each slab gives forth its own peculiar note and a musical scale is produced.

The bridge was difficult to erect.  Because of the remarkable soundness of the earth the foundation had to be secured by timber.  It has four elliptical arches each thirty feet apart, with battlements nearly {{convert|400|ft|m}} long.  The Erris prophet [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain]] referred to the then unbuilt bridge at Bellacorick in the 17th century.  He said that it would never be finished and it never has been.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inver.org/ceantar/des.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy generation ==

=== Peat-fired power station ===
[[Peat]] has been Ireland's staple fuel for centuries and still provides about 12% of the nation's energy needs.  In June 1949, James Kilroy TD, representing [[Erris]], requested the government to build a 'turf fired power station for the generation of electricity in Erris.  He also pointed out the advantage of reclaiming the bog and introducing a scheme of afforestation!.  The [[ESB Customer Supply|ESB]] acquired five and a half acres, two hundred metres from the bridge as the site for the [[power station]].  The access road was built over the ruins of the old shooting lodge.  At the same time [[Bord na Mona]] bought {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of bogland.  They harvested the turf to feed the power station.  The peat was pulverised and dried in the summer.  It was stored on the bog in large polythene covered piles.  It was then taken to the station by railway wagons pulled by diesel locomotives.

==== Closure ====
In 2007 the massive chimney at Bellacorick was demolished for safety reasons.  Even those who would have been opposed to the fossil-fuel burning power station on [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[greenhouse gas]] grounds were sad to see the chimney demolished as it had become a well-known landmark for those returning home to [[Erris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211127/http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |archivedate=9 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, although the visually attractive chimney has been removed, the visually offensive [[Abandoned property|derelict]] sixties-style block buildings, several storeys in height, are still standing, ungraciously draped with green netting, as a blot on the landscape.  As a result, it is difficult to get a decent view of the white windmills of the [[windfarm]] at the site.

=== Wind farm ===
Since 1992 Ireland's first commercial [[wind farm]] has been operating at Bellacorick.  The wind farm comprised 21 [[wind turbines]] with a total installed capacity of 6.45 [[megawatt]]s and produces enough electricity to supply 4,500 households.

The North Mayo area had long been identified as perhaps the best wind farm site in the country.  All the key criteria for a successful wind farm project were satisfied at Bellacorick.  The mean annual [[wind speed]] at the site at a height of 30 metres is 7.28&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The prevailing wind direction is south-westerly and the wind blows from the south west 50% of the time.  The wind regime is strong, steady winds.  The ground is flat with an open aspect to the prevailing winds, resulting in virtually no loss or [[turbulence]] due to [[topographical]] features. The nearby [[thermal]] [[power station]] is linked to the National Electricity Grid.  The Bellacorick [[wind farm]] is owned and operated by Renewable Energy Ireland whose major shareholder is [[Bord na Mona]].
The [[environment (systems)|environmental]] benefits of the wind farm can be stated in terms of [[Sustainability|environmental impacts]] avoided through not having to generate electricity from [[fossil fuel]] sources&amp;nbsp;– coal, [[peat]], oil and gas.  Bellacorick wind farm avoids the production of 120 tonnes of [[sulphur dioxide]], 85 tonnes of [[nitrous oxide]]s and 20,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] in a year.

On 16 February 2011, Capital Approval for the 400 kV Grid West Electricity Transmission Scheme (Grid West) was granted by the [[EirGrid]] Board. The project is driven by the need to connect 646.5 MW of Gate 3 wind generation at Bellacorick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf Grid25 -3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080753/http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf |date=23 May 2013 }} ''[[EirGrid]]''. March/April 2011. Accessed: 22 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2016}}, the project is awaiting consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eirgridgroup.com/the-grid/projects/grid-west/whats-happening-now/ |title=What's Happening Now?|publisher=[[EirGrid]] |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
Bus Éireann route 446 links Bellacorick with [[Crossmolina]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]]. In the reverse direction it links to [[Bangor Erris]], [[Belmullet]] and locations on the [[Mullet Peninsula]]. There is one service a day in each direction, including Sundays. On Friday evenings an extra journey operates from Ballina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517022954/http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ballina.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], the '''Brownian ratchet''' or '''Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet'''  is a [[thought experiment]] about an apparent [[perpetual motion]] machine first analysed in 1912 by Polish physicist [[Marian Smoluchowski]]&lt;ref name="Smoluchowski"&gt;M. von Smoluchowski (1912) Experimentell nachweisbare, der Ublichen Thermodynamik widersprechende Molekularphenomene, ''Phys.

The simple machine, consisting of a tiny [[paddle wheel]] and a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]], appears to be an example of a [[Maxwell's demon]], able to extract useful work from [[thermal fluctuations|random fluctuations]] (heat) in a system at [[thermal equilibrium]] in violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Detailed analysis by Feynman and others showed why it cannot actually do this.

==The machine==
The device consists of a gear known as a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] that rotates freely in one direction but is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a [[pawl]].  The ratchet is connected by an axle to a [[paddle wheel]] that is immersed in a [[fluid]] of [[molecule]]s at [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The molecules constitute a [[heat bath]] in that they undergo random [[Brownian motion]] with a mean [[kinetic energy]] that is determined by the [[temperature]].  The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle.  Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction.  The ratchet's motion then can be used to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other systems, for example lifting a weight (''m'') against gravity.  The energy necessary to do this work apparently would come from the heat bath, without any heat gradient. Were such a machine to work successfully, its operation would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]], one form of which states: "It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work."

==Why it fails==
Although at first sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman demonstrated that if the entire device is at the same temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work.  The reason is that since the pawl is at the same temperature as the paddle, it will also undergo Brownian motion, "bouncing" up and down.  It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up.  Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction.    Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; of the ratchet and pawl is the same as the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense.&lt;ref name="Feynman" /&gt; A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by [[Marcelo Osvaldo Magnasco|Magnasco]].&lt;ref name="forced"&gt;{{cite journal

If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the ratchet will indeed move forward, and produce useful work.  In this case, though, the energy is extracted from the temperature gradient between the two thermal reservoirs, and some [[waste heat]] is exhausted into the lower temperature reservoir by the pawl.  In other words, the device functions as a miniature [[heat engine]], in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the device will rotate in the opposite direction.

The Feynman ratchet model led to the similar concept of [[Brownian motor]]s, [[nanomachine]]s which can extract useful work not from thermal noise but from [[chemical potential]]s and other microscopic [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|nonequilibrium]] sources, in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
The [[ratchet and pawl]] was first discussed as a Second Law-violating device by [[Gabriel Lippmann]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Harmer"&gt;

Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], showing that if the temperature of the paddle ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was greater than the temperature of the ratchet ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', it would function as a [[heat engine]], but if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' there would be no net motion of the paddle.  In 1996, [[Juan Parrondo]] and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the [[Quasistatic process|quasistatic]] approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Brillouin-Paradoxon.svg|thumb|Brillouin paradox: an electrical analogue of the Brownian ratchet.]]

[[Léon Brillouin]] in 1950 discussed an electrical circuit analogue that uses a [[rectifier]] (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.627.2| title = Can the Rectifier Become a Thermodynamical Demon?| year = 1950| last1 = Brillouin | first1 = L.| journal = Physical Review| volume = 78| issue = 5| pages = 627-628|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..627B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was the diode would rectify the [[Johnson noise]] thermal current fluctuations produced by the [[resistor]], generating a [[direct current]]  which could be used to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an [[electromotive force]] that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations.  Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1652709| title = Spontaneous Reverse Current Due to the Brillouin EMF in a Diode| year = 1969| last1 = Gunn | first1 = J.

==Granular gas==
Researchers from the University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have constructed a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, when not in thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-[[Brownian motion]] into [[work (physics)|work]] by means of a [[Granular material#Granular gases|granular gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fom.nl/live/english/news/artikel.pag?objectnumber=120223 "Classical thought experiment brought to life in granular gas"], ''[[Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter]]'', Utrecht, 18 June 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state.  The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas.&lt;ref name="eshuis"&gt;

This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis.  However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads.  Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas.  Unlike an [[ideal gas]], though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop.  In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained.  Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength.  For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation.&lt;ref name="eshuis" /&gt;  The experiment was [http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/dryquicksand/ratchet/ratchet.html filmed].

'''Chinese bronze inscriptions''', also commonly referred to as '''Bronze script''' or '''Bronzeware script''', are writing in a variety of [[Chinese writing|Chinese scripts]] on [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] such as ''zhōng'' [[bell (instrument)#Ancient Chinese bells|bell]]s and ''[[ding (vessel)|dǐng]]'' tripodal cauldrons from the [[Shang dynasty]] (2nd millennium BC) to the [[Zhou dynasty]] (11th – 3rd century BC) and even later. Early bronze inscriptions were almost always [[casting|cast]] (that is, the writing was done with a stylus in the wet clay of the piece-mold from which the bronze was then cast), while later inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000 p.60&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], preceded by the [[oracle bone script]].

==Terminology==
[[Image:Chinese bronze inscription 牛 niu2 ox clan insignia Shang dynasty.svg|thumb|left|105px|Highly pictorial Shang clan emblem character (牛 niú "ox")]]
For the early [[Western Zhou]] to early [[Warring States]] period, the bulk of writing which has been unearthed has been in the form of [[bronze]] inscriptions.{{efn|There are also extremely small numbers of inscriptions from the ''Zhōuyuán'' (周原) [[oracle bones]] dating to the start of the Zhou dynasty (Qiú 2000, pp.68-9), as well as the Shĭ Zhoù Piān (史籀篇) compendium of ca. 800 BCE, a tiny fraction of which has been preserved as the ''zhòuwén'' (籀文) examples in ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', and finally, the [[Stone Drums of Qin]] of the late [[Spring and Autumn period]].}} As a result, it is common to refer to the variety of scripts of this period as "bronze script", even though there is no single such script. The term usually includes bronze inscriptions of the preceding [[Shang dynasty]] as well.{{efn|Bronze inscriptions also exist for the periods preceding and following this; but the bulk of earlier (Shang dynasty) writing is in [[oracle bone script]], while later writings are also available on [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo books]], silk books, and stone monuments ([[stele|stelae]]) in significant quantities.}}
However, there are great differences between the highly pictorial Shang emblem (aka "identificational") characters on bronzes (see "ox" clan insignia above), typical Shang bronze graphs, writing on bronzes from the middle of the Zhou dynasty, and that on late Zhou to [[Qin dynasty|Qin]], [[Han dynasty|Han]] and subsequent period bronzes. Furthermore, starting in the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the writing in each region gradually evolved in different directions, such that the script styles in the Warring States of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and the eastern regions, for instance, were strikingly divergent. In addition, artistic scripts also emerged in the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States, such as [[Bird-worm seal script|Bird Script]] (鳥書 ''niǎoshū''), also called Bird Seal Script (''niǎozhuàn'' 鳥篆 ), and [[Bird-worm seal script|Worm Script]] (''chóngshū'' 蟲書).

Right: Bronze ''fāng yí'' ritual container c. 1000 BCE. An inscription of some 180 characters appears twice on it, commenting on state rituals that accompany court ceremony, recorded by an official scribe.]]

Of the abundant [[Chinese ritual bronze]] artifacts extant today, about 12,000 have inscriptions.&lt;ref name="wilkinson428"&gt;Wilkinson (2000): 428.&lt;/ref&gt; These have been periodically unearthed ever since their creation, and have been systematically collected and studied since at least the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.62"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions tend to grow in length over time, from only one to six or so characters for the earlier Shang examples, to forty or so characters in the longest, late-Shang case,&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.62"/&gt; and frequently a hundred or more on Zhou bronzes, with the longest up to around 500.{{efn|Qiú 2000, p.68 cites 291 on the ''Dà Yú Dĭng'' (大盂鼎) , about 400 on the ''Xiǎo Yú Dĭng'' (小盂鼎), 350 on the ''Sǎn Shì Pán'' (散氏盤), 498 on the ''Máo Gōng Dĭng'' (毛公鼎), and 493 on a large ''bó'' bell cast by Shū Gōng (叔弓 (sic)) in the [[Spring and Autumn period]].}}

In general, characters on ancient Chinese bronze inscriptions were arranged in vertical columns, written top to bottom, in a fashion thought to have been influenced by [[bamboo]] books, which are believed to have been the main medium for writing in the Shang and Zhou dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Yahui, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The very narrow, vertical bamboo slats of these books were not suitable for writing wide characters, and so a number of graphs were rotated 90 degrees; this style then carried over to the Shang and Zhou oracle bones and bronzes. Examples: [[Image:Chinese characters from bronzes rotated 90 degrees.svg|left|thumb|450px|Examples of bronze inscription graphs rotated 270°: From left, ''mǎ'' 馬 "horse"; ''hǔ'' 虎 "tiger", ''shĭ'' 豕 "swine", ''quǎn'' 犬 "dog", ''xiàng'' 象 "elephant", ''guī'' 龜 "turtle", ''wèi'' 為 "to lead" (now "do"), ''jí'' 疾 "illness".]]

Of the 12,000 inscribed bronzes extant today, roughly 3,000 date from the Shang dynasty, 6,000 from the Zhou dynasty, and the final 3,000 from the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han dynasties]].&lt;ref name="wilkinson428" /&gt;

==Shang bronze inscriptions==
Inscriptions on [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] bronzes are of a fairly uniform style, making it possible to discuss a "Shang bronze script", although great differences still exist between typical characters and certain instances of clan names or emblems. Like early period [[oracle bone script]], the structures and orientations of individual graphs varied greatly in the Shang bronze inscriptions, such that one may find a particular character written differently each time rather than in a standardized way (see the many examples of "tiger" graph to the lower left). [[Image:Tiger colored gif.gif|315px|thumb|left|''hǔ'' 虎 "tiger" from bronze inscriptions (in green), compared to other script forms]] As in the oracle bone script, characters could be written facing left or right, turned 90 degrees, and sometimes even flipped vertically, generally with no change in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Image:Chinese character xu1 戌 11th Earthly Branch ORACLE BONE 1.jpg|13px]] and [[Image:Chinese character xu1 戌 11th Earthly Branch ORACLE BONE 2.jpg|13px]] both represent the modern character ''xū'' 戌 (the 11th [[Sexagenary cycle|Earthly Branch]]), while [[Image:Chinese oracle bone script character hou2 侯 marquis.gif|13px]] and [[File:侯-oracle.svg|13px]] are both ''hóu'' 侯 "marquis". This was true of normal as well as extra complex identificational graphs, such as the ''hǔ'' 虎 "tiger" clan emblem at right, which was turned 90 degrees clockwise on its bronze.

These inscriptions are almost all cast (as opposed to engraved),&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; and are relatively short and simple. Some were mainly to identify the name of a clan or other name,&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.64"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; while typical inscriptions include the maker's clan name and the posthumous title of the ancestor who is commemorated by the making and use of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000 p.62&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions, especially those late period examples identifying a name,&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.64"/&gt; are typically executed in a script of highly pictographic flavor, which preserves the formal, complex Shang writing as would have primarily been written on bamboo or wood books,&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.63"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The main writing medium of the time is believed to have been the writing brush and bamboo or wood books; although they have not survived, the character for such books, [[Image:Ce4 book from Shang1 dynasty bronze.png|16px]]  冊 ''cè'', showing their vertical slats bound with a horizontal string, is found on Shang and Zhou bronzes, as is the graph for the writing brush (see Qiú 2000, p.63, and Xǔ Yǎhuì, p.12). Historical references to use by the Shang of such books also exist, e.g., in the Duōshì chapter of the Shàngshū (Qiú pp.62-3)}} as opposed to the concurrent simplified, linearized and more rectilinear form of writing as seen on the oracle bones.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.70"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Shang inscriptions have been found which were brush-written on pottery, stone, jade or bone artifacts, and there are also some bone engravings on non-divination matters written in a complex, highly pictographic style;&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.64"/&gt; the structure and style of the bronze inscriptions is consistent with these.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.63"/&gt;

The soft clay of the piece-molds used to produce the Shang to early Zhou bronzes was suitable for preserving most of the complexity of the brush-written characters on such books and other media, whereas the hard, bony surface of the [[oracle bones]] was difficult to engrave, spurring significant simplification and conversion to rectilinearity. Furthermore, some of the characters on the Shang bronzes may have been more complex than normal due to particularly conservative&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; usage in this ritual medium, or when recording identificational inscriptions (clan or personal names); some scholars instead attribute this to purely decorative considerations.  Shang bronze script may thus be considered a ''formal'' script, similar to but sometimes even more complex than the unattested daily Shang script on bamboo and wood books and other media, yet far more complex than the [[oracle bone script|Shang script on the oracle bones]].

==Zhou dynasty inscriptions==

===Western Zhou===
Western Zhou dynasty characters (as exemplified by bronze inscriptions of that time) basically continue from the Shang writing system; that is, early W. Zhou forms resemble Shang bronze forms (both such as clan names,{{efn|Qiú 2000, p.69; p.65 footnote 5 also mentions that highly pictographic clan emblems and other identificational forms are still found in the Zhou period, especially the beginning of the W. Zhou.}} and typical writing), without any clear or sudden distinction. They are, like their Shang predecessors in all media, often irregular in shape and size, and the structures and details often vary from one piece of writing to the next, and even within the same piece. Although most are not pictographs in function, the early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions have been described as more pictographic in flavor than those of subsequent periods. During the Western Zhou, many graphs begin to show signs of simplification and linearization (the changing of rounded elements into squared ones, solid elements into short line segments, and thick, variable-width lines into thin ones of uniform width), with the result being a decrease in pictographic quality, as depicted in the chart below.
[[Image:Chinese characters on bronzes Linearization table.gif|thumb|center|300px|Linearization of characters during the Western Zhou]]
Some flexibility in orientation of graphs (rotation and reversibility) continues in the Western Zhou, but this becomes increasingly scarce throughout the Zhou dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; The graphs start to become slightly more uniform in structure, size and arrangement by the time of the third Zhou sovereign, [[King Kang of Zhou|King Kāng]], and after the ninth, [[King Yi of Zhou (Ji Xie)|King Yì]], this trend becomes more obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, pp.69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have used the problematic term "[[large seal script|large seal]]" (大篆 ''dàzhuàn'') to refer to the script of this period. This term dates back to the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; when (small) [[seal script]] and [[clerical script]] were both in use. It thus became necessary to distinguish between the two, as well as any earlier script forms which were still accessible in the form of books and inscriptions, so the terms "[[large seal script|large seal]]" (大篆 ''dàzhuàn'') and "small seal" (小篆 ''xiǎozhuàn'', aka 秦篆 ''Qín zhuàn'') came into being. However, since the term "large seal" is ''variously'' used to describe ''zhòuwén'' (籀文) examples from the ca. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] compendium, ''or'' inscriptions on both late W. Zhou bronze inscriptions and the [[Stone Drums of Qin]], ''or'' all forms (including [[oracle bone script]]) predating small seal, the term is best avoided entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Zhou===

====Spring and Autumn====

By the beginning of the [[Eastern Zhou]], in the [[Spring and Autumn period]], many graphs are fully linearized, as seen in the chart above; additionally, curved lines are straightened, and disconnected lines are often connected, with the result of greater convenience in writing, but a marked decrease in pictographic quality.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.70"/&gt;

In the Eastern Zhou, the various states initially continued using the same forms as in the late Western Zhou. However, regional forms then began to diverge stylistically as early as the Spring and Autumn period,&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p. 71 &amp; 76&lt;/ref&gt; with the forms in the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] remaining more conservative. At this time, [[Seal (Chinese)|seals]] and minted coins, both probably primarily of bronze, were already in use, according to traditional documents, but none of the extant seals have yet been indisputably dated to that period.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid to late Spring and Autumn period, artistic derivative scripts with vertically elongated forms appeared on bronzes, especially in the eastern and southern states, and remained in use into the Warring States period (see detail of inscription from the Warring States [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng|Tomb of Marquis Yĭ of Zēng]] below left). In the same areas, in the late Spring and Autumn to early [[Warring States]], scripts which embellished basic structures with decorative forms such as birds or worms also appeared. These are known as Bird Script (''niǎoshū'' 鳥書) and Worm Script (''chóngshū'' 蟲書), and collectively as [[Bird-worm seal script|Bird-worm script]]s, (''niǎochóngshū'' 鳥蟲書; see Bronze sword of King Gōujiàn to right); however, these were primarily decorative forms for inscriptions on bronzes and other items, and not scripts in daily use.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, pp.71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Some bronzes of the period were incised in a rough, casual manner, with graph structures often differing somewhat from typical ones. It is thought that these reflected the popular (vulgar) writing of the time which coexisted with the formal script.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warring States period====
[[Seal (Chinese)|Seals]] have been found from the [[Warring States period]], mostly cast in bronze,&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.80 notes that some were also silver or jade&lt;/ref&gt; and minted bronze coins from this period are also numerous. These form an additional, valuable resource for the study of Chinese bronze inscriptions. It is also from this period that the first surviving bamboo and silk manuscripts have been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Warring States period, typical bronze inscriptions were similar in content and length to those in the late [[Western Zhou]] to [[Spring and Autumn period]].&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.79"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous sets of bronzes ever discovered dates to the early Warring States: a large set of ''[[Bianzhong|biānzhōng]]'' bells from the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng|tomb of Marquis Yĭ of the state of Zēng]], unearthed in 1978. The total length of the inscriptions on this set was almost 2,800 characters.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.79"/&gt; [[Image:Bianzhong.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Bronze biānzhōng bells from the early Warring States Tomb of Marquis Yĭ of Zēng]]

In the mid to late Warring States period, the average length of inscriptions decreased greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Many, especially on weapons, recorded only the date, maker and so on, in contrast with earlier narrative contents. Beginning at this time, such inscriptions were typically engraved onto the already cast bronzes, rather than being written into the wet clay of piece-molds as had been the earlier practice. The engraving was often roughly and hastily executed.&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.79-80 &amp; 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In Warring States period bronze inscriptions, trends from the late Spring and Autumn period continue, such as the use of artistically embellished scripts (e.g., Bird and Insect Scripts) on decorated bronze items. In daily writing, which was not embellished in this manner, the typical script continued evolving in different directions in various regions, and this divergence was accelerated by both a lack of central political control as well as the spread of writing outside of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.78"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; In the state of Qin, which was somewhat culturally isolated from the other states, and which was positioned on the old Zhou homeland, the script became more uniform and stylistically symmetrical,&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.97"&gt;Qiú 2000, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; rather than changing much structurally. Change in the script was slow, so it remained more similar to the typical late Western Zhou script as found on bronzes of that period and the [[Shizhoupian|Shĭ Zhoù Piān (史籀篇)]] compendium of ca. 800 BCE.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;陳昭容 Chén Zhāoróng 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was not until around the middle of the [[Warring States]] period that popular (aka common or vulgar) writing gained momentum in Qin, and even then, the vulgar forms remained somewhat similar to traditional forms, changing primarily in terms of becoming more rectilinear. Traditional forms in Qin remained in use as well, so that two forms of writing coexisted. The traditional forms in Qin evolved slowly during the [[Eastern Zhou]], gradually becoming what is now called (small) [[seal script]] during that period, without any clear dividing line (it is not the case, as is commonly believed, that small seal script was a sudden invention by [[Li Si]] in the [[Qin dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;). Meanwhile, the Qin vulgar writing evolved into early clerical (or proto-clerical) in the late Warring States to Qin dynasty period,&lt;ref&gt;Qiú 2000, p.78, 104 &amp; 107&lt;/ref&gt; which would then evolve further into the [[clerical script]] used in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] through the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]-[[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] periods.{{efn|Although popularly associated only with the Han dynasty, clerical actually remained in use alongside cursive, neo-clerical and semi-cursive scripts until ''after'' the Wei-Jin period, when the modern standard script became dominant; see Qiu 2000, p.113}}

Meanwhile, in the eastern states, vulgar forms had become popular sooner; they also differed more radically from and more completely displaced the traditional forms.&lt;ref name="Qiú 2000, p.78"/&gt; These eastern scripts, which also varied somewhat by state or region, were later misunderstood by [[Xu Shen]], author of the Han dynasty etymological dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', who thought they predated the Warring States Qin forms, and thus labeled them ''gǔwén'' (古文), or "ancient script".

[[Image:Cycle of Abuse.png|thumb|400px|The four phases of the Cycle of Abuse]]
The '''cycle of abuse''' is a [[social cycle theory]] developed in 1979 by [[Lenore E. Walker]] to explain patterns of behavior in an [[abusive]] relationship.

==Overview==
[[Lenore E. Walker]] interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to [[domestic violence]] and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the "cycle of abuse".&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie S. Fisher; Steven P. Lab. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8kHrWPLLX54C&amp;pg=PA257 Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention]''. SAGE Publications; 2 February 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6047-2}}. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling [[patriarchal]] behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. Her terms "the battering cycle" and "battered woman syndrome" has since been largely eclipsed by "cycle of abuse" and "[[battered person syndrome]]", respectively, for many reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn't always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, "The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton |first=Donald G. |year=1994 |title=Patriarchy And Wife Assault: The Ecological Fallacy |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=9 |number=2 |pages=167–182 |url=http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229141744/http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cycle of abuse concept is widely used in [[domestic violence]] programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"&gt;Dutton, Donald G. and Susan Golant. 1997. The Batterer: A Psychological Profile. {{ISBN|0465033881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
The cycle usually goes in the following order, and will repeat until the conflict is stopped, usually by the survivor entirely abandoning the relationship&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, Lundy. ''Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men'' Berkley Publishing Group 2002 {{ISBN|0-399-14844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some form of intervention.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9"&gt;Willis C. Newman; Esmeralda Newman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA9 Domestic Violence: Causes and Cures and Anger Management]''. Willis Newman; 12 May 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4528-4323-0}}. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle can occur hundreds of times in an abusive relationship, the total cycle taking anywhere from a few hours, to a year or more to complete. However, the length of the cycle usually diminishes over time so that the "reconciliation" and "calm" stages may disappear,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} violence becomes more intense and the cycles become more frequent.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

===1: Tension building===
Stress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, it may last as much as several months.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31"&gt;Scott Allen Johnson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9ucrMFdC8C&amp;pg=PA31 Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies]''. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-7259-9}}. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent violence, the victim may try to reduce the tension by becoming compliant and nurturing. Or, to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury, the victim may provoke the batterer. "However, at no time is the batterer justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior," said Scott Allen Johnson, author of ''Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders''.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt;

===2: Acute violence===
Characterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents which may be preceded by [[verbal abuse]]&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; and include [[psychological abuse]].&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt; During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate their partner (survivor) with the use of domestic violence.

In [[intimate partner violence]], children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence and the partner's relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim "had it coming" to them.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

===3: Reconciliation/honeymoon===
The perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

Characterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually [[Love bombing|shower the survivor with love and affection]]. The abuser may use [[Victim playing|self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy]] and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Susan ''Helping her get free'' Seal Press 2006 {{ISBN|1-58005-167-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4: Calm===
During this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceable. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counseling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; Over time, the batterer's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt; However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

==Critiques==
Walker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence,&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"/&gt; which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the "escalation" or tension building stage, which includes triggers, the victim feeling victimized, angry and depressed, isolation and revenge planning. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Allen Johnson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9ucrMFdC8C&amp;pg=PA33 Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies]''. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-7259-9}}. p. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Dutton and Susan Golant agree that Walker's cycle of abuse accurately describes all cyclically abusive relationships they studied. Nonetheless, they also note that her initial research was based almost entirely on [[anecdotal]] data from a rather small set of women who were in violent relationships.&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"/&gt; Walker herself wrote, "These women were not randomly selected and they cannot be considered a legitimate [[data base]] from which to make specific generalizations."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Lenore E. (1979) ''The Battered Woman''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cycle of Abuse'''. In some areas of psychological research, violence is thought rarely to be only a one-time event. When abuse occurs in a relationship, it is said that the odds of re-occurrence increase dramatically.

'''Phase 1''': In this phase, tension is mounting within a home or situation. This is when minor conflicts occur and threats of violence may escalate.   The duration of this phase may last from a few hours to sometimes months.

'''Phase 2''': In this phase, the actual hands on abuse often occurs. The abuser may slap, kick, choke, or even commit worse bodily harm to the victim. The use of sexual acts or the use of weapons may occur. It is in this phase that there are usually no witnesses and there is little the victim can do to stop the violence.

'''Phase 3:''' The is often called the apology phase or the "Honeymoon" phase. The abuser may apologize and show great signs of remorse and beg for forgiveness. Often, the abuser will present gifts and tokens so that the victim will excuse the abuse. The abuser may even promise to seek treatment for the behavior and promise it will never happen again.

'''Phase 4''': Phase 1 starts all over again in a vicious cycle. Unfortunately, the abuse begins again and most often the abuser is more violent and terrorizing in his/her acts. The victim is often injured to the point of hospitalization or worse and often can not find an escape out of the situation.

This cycle is seen as 'never ending', unless 'the victim' finds a way to physically leave the situation.

Criticisms have been raised about the methodological limitations of the research from which this theory arises. While the theory 'fits' the anecdotal experience of many partners in abusive relationships, there are questions about its universal and determinist application as a prognostic tool. Coverage of this theory in the media and in popular self-help books is said to have distorted public perception of the complexity &amp; diversity of relationship breakdown, and also contributed to the design of unsatisfactory interventions by the state in relationships.--&gt;

[[File:Use of Deadly Force Authorized (5730792058).jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley AFB]]]]

'''Deadly force''', also known as '''lethal force''', is [[use of force]] that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or [[death]] to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a [[wikt:last resort|last resort]], when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

[[Firearm]]s, [[bladed weapon]]s, [[explosive material|explosive]]s, and [[vehicle]]s are among those [[weapon]]s the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of [[Improvised weapon|non-traditional weapons]] in an offensive manner, such as a [[baseball bat]], sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

{{Main|Police use of deadly force in the United States}}
The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines deadly force as "force that a person uses causing, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury".&lt;ref&gt;AFI 31-207 Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', July 2012, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United States]], the use of deadly force by sworn [[law enforcement officers]] is lawful  when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others.  The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' ruling in 1985 when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] said that "deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others." &lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

In the 1989 ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include "objective reasonableness" standard—not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Most [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] establish a [[use of force continuum]] starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum to the force they are opposing.

A [[civilian]]'s use of deadly force is generally [[justifiable homicide|justified]] if he or she reasonably believe that he or she is or other innocent lives are in imminent danger of death or serious injury.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;  Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children or prevention of sexual assaults. 

[[U.S. law]] requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person's death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for the particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt; A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officers|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0074.htm|publisher=Chief Attorney|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation to motor vehicles ===
In {{cite court

  |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1631.ZS.html
}}, the (U.S. Supreme Court 2007) held that a police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], even when it places the fleeing [[motorist]] at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the ''Harris'' case, Officer Scott [[PIT maneuver|applied his police car's push bumper to the rear of the suspect's vehicle]], causing the [[suspect]] vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.&lt;ref name="robertankony" /&gt;

Traditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Adams v. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department
  |vol=998
  |reporter=F.2d
  |opinion=923
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=1993
}},
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles such fatalities are infrequent, and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by
{{cite court
  |litigants=Harris v Coweta County
 |vol=406
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=1307
  |court=11th Cir.
  |date=2005
}}, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Scott v. Harris'' case discussed above; the extent to which ''Adams'' can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the ''Adams'' case, the officer rammed the suspect's vehicle.

In
{{cite court
  |litigants=Donovan v. City of Milwaukee
  |vol=17
  |reporter=F.3d
  |opinion=944
  |court=7th Cir.
  |date=1994
}}, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the ''Donovan'' case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer's vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.

'''Denying the antecedent''', sometimes also called '''inverse error''' or '''fallacy of the inverse''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of inferring the [[inverse (logic)|inverse]] from the original statement. It is committed by reasoning in the [[argument form|form]]:&lt;ref name=KA&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/wi-phi/wiphi-critical-thinking/wiphi-fallacies/v/denying-the-antecedent |author=Matthew C. Harris |title=Denying the antecedent |publisher=[[Khan academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If ''P'', then ''Q''.
:Therefore, if not ''P'', then not ''Q''.

which may also be phrased as

:&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;    (P implies Q)
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore \neg P \rightarrow \neg Q&lt;/math&gt;    (therefore, not-P implies not-Q)&lt;ref name= KA/&gt;

[[Argument]]s of this form are [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. Informally, this means that arguments of this form do not give good reason to establish their conclusions, even if their premises are true.

The name ''denying the antecedent'' derives from the premise "not ''P''", which denies [[Antecedent (logic)|the "if" clause]] of the [[indicative conditional|conditional]] premise.

One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample that has true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:

:If you are a ski instructor, then you have a job.
:You are not a ski instructor
:Therefore, you have no job&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;

That argument is intentionally bad, but arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example offered by [[Alan Turing]] in the article "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]":

{{quote|If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, men could still be machines that do not follow a definite set of rules. Thus, this argument (as Turing intends) is invalid.

It is possible that an argument that denies the antecedent could be valid, if the argument instantiates some other valid form. For example, if the claims ''P'' and ''Q'' express the same proposition, then the argument would be trivially valid, as it would [[begging the question|beg the question]]. In everyday discourse, however, such cases are rare, typically only occurring when the "if-then" premise is actually an "[[if and only if]]" claim (i.e., a [[logical biconditional|biconditional]]/[[logical equality|equality]]). For example:

:If I am [[President of the United States]], then I can veto Congress.
:I am not President.
:Therefore, I cannot veto Congress.

The above argument is not valid, but would be if the first premise ended thus: "...and if I can veto Congress, then I am the U.S. President" (as is in fact true). More to the point, the validity of the new argument stems not from denying the antecedent, but ''[[modus tollens]]'' (denying the consequent).

Dharani are found in the ancient texts of all major traditions of Buddhism. They are a major part of the Pali canon preserved by the [[Theravada]] tradition.

Zhoushu, “spell techniques,” was one of the most
prevalent translations of dharani used by Buddhists in medieval China. Seminal Buddhist literature describes an ordinary monk as a student of spell techniques and the acquisition of dharani as a prominent quality of a bodhisattva. Dharani have a firmly established position in the Mahayana doctrine of the bodhisattva path. They were perceived to be part of an ordinary monk’s religious cultivation and a by-product of meditation. In this respect they are closely associated with an advanced monk or bodhisattva’s acquisition of the spiritual penetrations, supernormal powers and the ability to work miracles. [...] Dharani and spells were functional and fashionable in medieval
Sinitic Buddhism and their role in Chinese religion has continued to the present. They were understood and used as powerful practices to promote the Buddhist teaching and to protect the personal and spiritual welfare of believers. Yet, the very success of Buddhist spells was probably due to the long-standing value of spells and talismans in Chinese religion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt; In some Buddhist regions, they served as texts upon which the Buddhist witness would swear to tell the truth.&lt;ref name=Kooij1978&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

The word ''dhāraṇī'' derives from a Sanskrit root √''dhṛ'' meaning "to hold or maintain".&lt;ref name="mcbride2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braarvig, Jens (1985), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; This root is likely derived from the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] of ancient India where chants and melodious sounds were believed to have innate spiritual and healing powers even if the sound cannot be translated and has no meaning (as in a music).

According to the traditional belief in Tibetan texts, states Jose Cabezon – the Dalai Lama professor of Tibetan Buddhism studies, there were three councils and the term ''dharani'' was recorded and became the norm after the third council.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The first council, according to this belief, compiled the ''Sutranta'', the ''Vinaya'' and the ''Abhidhamma'' in  Vimalabhada to the south of Rajagriha in India. The first council was held in the year Buddha died, but the compiled dhamma consisted of spoken words that were not written down.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The second council occurred about 200 years after the death of the Buddha in a grove provided by [[Ashoka]], where the knowledge was compiled again, but it too did not write anything down.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The third council gathered in Kashmir a century later, according to the Tibetan tradition, and the teachings were put down in writing for those "who had not obtained the power (''dharani'') of not-forgetting"  because people were reciting corrupted forms of the teachings of the Buddha. In this context, ''dharani'' were acknowledged in the Buddhist tradition by about 2nd-century BCE, and they were a memory aid to ground and remember the ''[[dhamma]]'' teachings.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Ignacio Cabezon|title=The Buddha's Doctrine and the Nine Vehicles: Rog Bande Sherab's Lamp of the Teachings|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty3O7BZYO5QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-995862-7|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term dharani as used in the history of Mahayana and tantric Buddhism, and its interpretation has been problematic since the mid-19th-century, states Ronald Davidson. It was initially understood as "magical formula or phrase", but later studies such as by Lamotte and Berhard interpreted them to be "memory", while Davidson proposes that some dharani are "codes".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} [[Eugène Burnouf]], the 19th-century French Indologist and a scholar of Buddhism, dharanis are magical formulas that to Buddhist devotees are the most important parts of their books.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|p=100}} Burnouf, states Davidson, was the first scholar to realise how important and widespread dharani had been in Buddhism sutras and Mahayana texts.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=100-101}} The Indologist [[Moriz Winternitz]] concurred in early 20th-century that dharanis constituted a "large and important" part of Mahayana Buddhism, and that they were magic formulae and "protective spells" as well as amulets.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}}

According to Winternitz, a dharani resembles the incantations found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and ''[[Yajurveda]]'' of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}} The dharani-genre of Buddhist literature includes mantra, states [[Étienne Lamotte]], but they were also a "memory aid" to memorize and chant Buddha's teachings. This practice was linked to concentration (''samadhi'') and believed to have magical virtues and a means to both spiritual and material ''karma''-related [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] making.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=103-105}} According to Braarvig, the dharanis are "seemingly meaningless strings of syllables". While they may once have been "memory aids", the dharanis that have survived into the modern era do not match with any text. In later practice, the dharanis were "hardly employed as summaries of doctrine, but were employed as aids to concentration and magical protection benefits".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=105-106}}

According to Jan Nattier, Vedic mantras are more ancient than Buddhist dharani, but over time they both were forms of incantations that are quite similar.&lt;ref name="nattier202"/&gt; In the early texts of Buddhism, proposes Nattier,  "it would appear that the word dharani was first employed in reference to mnemonic devices used to retain (Skt. "hold") certain elements of Buddhist doctrine in one's memory". In Nattier's view, the term dharani is "peculiar to Buddhism".&lt;ref name="nattier202"&gt;{{harvnb|Nattier|1992|pp=201-202 note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dhāraṇī can be a [[mnemonic]] to encapsulate the meaning of a section or chapter of a [[sutra]].&lt;ref name="nattier158"&gt;Nattier 1992, pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddhism-related writer [[Red Pine (author)|Red Pine]], ''mantra'' and ''dharani'' were originally interchangeable, but at some point ''dhāraṇī'' came to be used for meaningful, intelligible phrases, and mantra for syllabic formulae which are not meant to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Robert Buswell and Ronald Davidson, ''dharani'' were codes in some Buddhist texts. They appeared at the end of the text, and they may be seen as a coded, distilled summary of Buddhist teachings in the chapters that preceded it.&lt;ref name=Buswell240/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2014|pp=5-11}} For example, the ''Vajrasamadhi-sutra'' – a Korean Buddhist text likely composed in the 7th-century by an unknown monk, one important to the Ch'an ([[Zen Buddhism]]) tradition in East Asia, the ''Dharani'' chapter is the eighth (second last), with a brief conversational epilogue between the Tathagata Buddha and Ananda being the last chapter. This ''dharani'' chapter,  states Buswell, "encodes (''dharayati'') the important meanings, without forgetting them, and it reminds and codes the points to remember.&lt;ref name=Buswell240&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Buswell Jr.|title=The Formation of Ch'an Ideology in China and Korea: The Vajrasamadhi-Sutra, a Buddhist Apocryphon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYrDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8703-3|pages=xiii-xv, 3-6, 240–248 with footnote 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indologist [[Frits Staal]] who is known for his scholarship on mantras and chants in Indian religions, states the Dharani mantras reflect a continuity of the Vedic mantras.&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt; He quotes Wayman to be similarly stressing the view that the Buddhist chants have a "profound debt to the Vedic religion".&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayman1990p413"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=430, context: 413–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yogacara scholars, states Staal, followed the same classification as one found in the Vedas – ''arthadharani'', ''dharmadharani'' and ''mantradharani'', along with express acknowledgment like the Vedas that some "dharani are meaningful and others are meaningless" yet all effective for ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt;

The early Buddhism literature includes the dharani spells and incantations. It demonstrates that dharanis were valued and in use within Buddhist communities before the 1st-century CE, state Charles Prebish and Damien Keown.&lt;ref name="PrebishKeown2010p92"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles S.

The role of dharanis in Buddhist practice of mid-1st-millennium CE is illustrated by numerous texts including the systematic treatises that emerged. According to Paul Copp, one of the earliest attestable literary mandate about writing dharanis as an effective spell in itself is found in a Chinese text dated between 317 and 420 CE.{{sfn|Copp|2014|pp=31-32}} This text is the ''Qifo bapusa suoshuo da tuoluoni shenzhou jing'' (or, Great Dharani Spirit-Spell Scripture Spoken by the Seven Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas).{{sfn|Copp|2014|pp=31-32}} ''The Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras'', for example, were compiled in the mid-seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shinohara | first=Koichi | title=Spells, Images, and Mandalas | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-231-53739-1 | pages=28-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oldest Buddhist religious inscriptions in Stupas ([[Dagoba (architecture)|Dagoba]], Chörten) are extracts from dharani-genre compositions such as the ''Bodhigarbhalankaralaksa-dharani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert N.

People who wish to perform the ceremony for it should, on the 8th, 13th, 14th or 15th day of the month, walk round and round the pagoda containing the relics a full seventy-seven times, with it on their right, reciting this charm [dhāraṇī] also seventy-seven times: they should build an altar and keep its surface clean. They should have the charm copied out seventy-seven times, and out of respect for the ceremony should give the copyist perfume, flowers, food and drink, clean clothes and a bath, and reward him either by anointing and covering him with perfumes or by giving him much money, or by paying him according to his ability. Then they should take these copies of the charms, place them inside the pagoda, and make offerings at the pagoda. Alternatively they should make seventy-seven small clay pagodas, place one copy inside each, and make offerings. If they duly perform this, people who are about to die will prolong their lives to old age, all their previous sins and evil deeds being completely destroyed.

Early mentions of dharani in the European literature are from the records left by John of Plano Carpini (1245–7) and William of Rubruck (1254) where they wrote in their respective memoirs that Uighurs and Mongols chanted "Om man baccam", later identified with "Om mani padme hum". They also mention that these Asians write "short sorcery sentences on paper and hang them up".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} Other than such scant remarks, little was known about the Dharani-genre of literature or its value in Buddhism till the mid-19th-century colonial era, when Brian Hodgson began buying Sanskrit and related manuscripts in Nepal, Tibet and India for a more thorough scholarship, often at his personal expense.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} According to Hodgson, as quoted by Ronald Davidson, dharani were esoteric short prayers "derived from [Buddhist tantric] Upadesa" that are believed to be amulet to be constantly repeated or worn inside little lockets, something that leads to "a charmed life".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}}&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;

The colonial era scholarship initially proposed that the dharanis and related rituals may have been an influence on Buddhism of other Indian religions such as from the esoteric tantra traditions of Hinduism around the mid-1st-millennium CE. This assumption, along with the view that early Buddhism was an "abstract philosophy or even a broad-based social movement" is now a part of a scholarly debate. With increased access to the primary texts of Buddhism and the discoveries of historical manuscripts in China, Korea and Japan, such as those about early Silla Buddhism, McBride and others state that dharani incantations and ritualism had widespread significance in East Asia from the early years.&lt;ref name="McBride2008p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D.

According to Richard McBride, as well as Richard Payne,&lt;ref name=payne2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard K.

There is no evidence for such a sequential development. Instead, the evidence points to an overlap but that the significance of the dharanis in mainstream Buddhist traditions and the esoteric Buddhist tantra tradition co-existed independent of each other. Phonic mysticism and musical chanting based on dharanis – ''parittas'' or ''raksas'' in the Theravada Pali literature{{refn|group=note|According to Joseph Kitagawa, Atanatiya Suttanta (''DN 32'') illustrates such apotropaic formulae in the Pali canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Kitagawa|title=The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfyzAAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-87597-7|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} – along with related mantras were important in early Buddhism.&lt;ref name=payne2006/&gt; They continue to be an essential part of actual Buddhist practice in Asia, both for its laypersons and the monks.&lt;ref name=payne2006/&gt; The emerging evidence and later scholarship increasingly states that "dharani and ritual procedures were mainstream Mahayana practices" many centuries before the emergence of tantric and esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayana, states McBride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practical Buddhist Thaumaturgy: The "Great Dhāraṇī on Immaculately Pure Light" in Medieval Sinitic Buddhism| author= Richard D.

Dharanis are not limited to an esoteric cult within Buddhism, states Paul Copp, rather the "dharani incantations and related mystic phrases and practices have been integral parts of nearly all Buddhist traditions since at least the early centuries of the common era".&lt;ref name="Copp2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Copp | first=Paul | title=The Body Incantatory | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-231-53778-0 | doi=10.7312/copp16270 | pages=1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''guhya'' mantra are about male deity and female deity relationships and union. The ''vidya'' mantra represent the mind of male Buddhist deities, while ''dharani'' mantras of the female Buddhist deities. Theologically, the ''vidya'' mantras constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism, according to Cabezon, which "pacifies the suffering experienced in the existential world (''samsara'') and the heaps of faults such as desire".&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p108"/&gt; The ''dharani'' mantras, in contrast, constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism which "causes one to hold onto the ''dhamma'', to remember the ''dhamma'', to remember virtue".&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p108"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Ignacio Cabezon|title=The Buddha's Doctrine and the Nine Vehicles: Rog Bande Sherab's Lamp of the Teachings|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty3O7BZYO5QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-995862-7|pages=108–111 with footnote 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little prescriptive or practical difference between dharani and mantras except that dharani are much longer, states Eugene Burnouf.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|p=100}}

According to Winternitz, a Buddhist dharani resembles the incantations and mantras found in Hinduism. A dharani may contain simple magical syllables and words without any literal meaning (''mantra-padani''), or its power is believed to result from it containing words or wisdom ''in nunce'' from a Buddhist Sutta.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}}&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature: Buddhist literature and Jaina literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0265-0|pages=367–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Horiuzi manuscript of ''Prajna paramita hrdaya sutra'' and ''Usnisha Vijaya dharani'' dated to 609 CE illustrate both, with the latter being only invocations consisting of meaningless series of syllables.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt; In Buddhism, a dharani has been believed to have magical virtues and a means to earn [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] to offset the past ''karma'', allay fear, diseases and disasters in this life, and for a better [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. To the lay Buddhist communities, states Davidson, the material benefits encouraged the popularity and use of dharanis for devotionalism, rituals and rites in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=103-105}} According to Janet Gyatso, there is a difference between mantras and dharanis. The mantras are more than melodious sounds and have meaning, and these were found sporadically in pre-Mahayana Buddhism. With the emergence of the Mahayana Buddhism tradition, the dharanis became closely related to mantras. Later, as the Vajrayana Buddhism tradition grew, they proliferated. The dharanis and mantras overlap because in the Vajrayana tradition. There exist "single seed-syllable ''bija'' like dharanis, treated as having special powers to protect chanters from dangers such as "snakes, enemies, demons and robbers".&lt;ref name="Gyatso173"/&gt; The ''bija'' (seed) mantra condenses the protective powers of a Buddhist deity or a Buddhist text into a single syllable. For example, the single letter "a" (अ) condenses the 100,000 verses of the ''Prajna-paramita sutras'' into a single syllable.&lt;ref name="Gyatso174"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Gyatso|title=In the Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RCsM6GqjicQC&amp;pg=PA174| year=1992| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0525-4|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Buddhist monk [[Kūkai]] drew a distinction between ''dhāraṇī'' and ''mantra'' and used it as the basis of his theory of language. According to Kūkai, a Buddhist ''mantra'' is restricted to esoteric Buddhist practice whereas ''dhāraṇī'' is found in both esoteric and exoteric rituals. In the Nara and early [[Heian period]] of Japanese history, a monk or nun was tested for their fluency and knowledge of dharanis to confirm whether they are well trained and competent in Buddhist knowledge. Their appointment letters listed the sutras and dharanis that he or she could recite from memory.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appointment recommendation letter dated 732 CE, as an example, a Japanese priest named Chishu supports the ordination of his student Hata no kimi Toyotari by listing that he can recite following dharanis: "the ''Greater Prajna-paramita'', Amoghapasa Avalokiteshvara, Eleven-faced Avalokiteshvara, the ''Golden Light'', Akashagarbha, Bhaisajyaguru, consecrating water, concealing ritual space" with the dharani rituals of prostration after eight years of training.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt; A study of numerous such ''ubasoku koshinge'' recommendation letters from the 1st-millennium Japan confirm that dharanis were an essential and core part of monastic training, though the specific group of dharanis memorized by a monk or nun varied.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt;

Kūkai classified mantras as a special class of dhāraṇīs and argued that every syllable of a dhāraṇī was a manifestation of the true nature of reality – in Buddhist terms, that all sound is a manifestation of ''[[śūnyatā]]'' or emptiness of self-nature. Thus, rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dhāraṇīs are in fact saturated with meaning – every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=159–176, 490–491 with notes 72, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Megha-Sutra'' is an example of an ancient Mahayana magico-religious text. In it, the snake deities appear before the Buddha and offer him adoration, then ask how the suffering of snakes, as well as people, can be alleviated. The text suggests friendliness (''maitri'') and lists numerous invocations such as those to female deities, exorcisms, means to induce rains, along with a series of magical formulae such as ''"sara sire sire suru suru naganam java java jivi jivi juvu juvu etc"'', states Moriz Winternitz.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt; The historic Mahayana dharanis have survived as single manuscripts as well as large collections.

The popularity of Buddhist spells in China was probably because older native Chinese religions valued spells already.&lt;ref name=mcbridechina/&gt;

According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, it is "almost certain" that some of the East Asian Buddhist literature on dharani were indigenous Chinese texts and syncretic with the [[Daoism|Daoist]] practices.&lt;ref name="buswellLopez2013p330"/&gt; For example, the ''Guanding jing'' composed in mid-5th century in China is largely a collection of magical spells in the dharani-genre in twelve semi-independent chapters. It includes spells such as those of the 72,000 spirit kings to protect Bhikshus (Buddhist monks), spells of the 120,000 spirit kings to protect the Bhikshunis (Buddhist nuns), incantations of spirit kings to protect one's surroundings, seals and spells to subdue devils, chants to summon dragon kings to treat infections and remove pests, and seeking rebirth in pure lands of one's desire, state Buswell and Lopez.&lt;ref name="buswellLopez2013p330"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

The significance of dharanis was such that both the government and monastic organization had stipulated, by the 7th-century, how and when dharanis may or may not be used. A ''ritsuryo'' code for Buddhist clerics dated 718 CE, promulgated by the Nara government in Japan, forbid the use of dharani for any unauthorized medical, military and political rebellion. The code explicitly exempted their use for "healing of the sick by chanting dharanis in accordance with the Buddha dharma".&lt;ref name="Abe1999161"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another document dated 797 CE mentions "healer-meditation masters" (''kanbyo zenji'') in dharanis to protect the family of the ruler. Others evidence the use of dharani chanting by monks and nuns as "one of the common methods of healing during the Nara period", states Ryûichi Abé.&lt;ref name="Abe1999161"/&gt;

The dharanis were an essential part of the ''rokujikyoho'' (six-syllable sutra) liturgy ritual in Japan, states Benedetta Lomi. The ''ritsuryo'' code They were greatly popular between the 11th- and 15th-centuries and a part of comprehensive solution to various ailments, a ritual performed by Buddhist monks and practitioners of ''[[onmyōdō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benedetta Lomi |year= 2014  | title=Dharanis, Talismans, and Straw-Dolls: Ritual Choreographies and Healing Strategies of the "Rokujikyōhō" in Medieval Japan| jstor=43233881| journal= Japanese Journal of Religious Studies| volume= 41| number= 2| pp=255-257| url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/4341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada tradition===
The [[Theravada]] tradition is found in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian Buddhist countries. The three historic ritual practices of the Theravada community include the Buddha puja (''[[triratna]]'' rite), the Five Precepts ceremony (''pancasil''), and the protective chanting of Paritrana (''[[paritta]]'').&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"/&gt; The Theravada Paritrana texts are equivalent to the Dharani texts in the Mahayana tradition, both providing protective charm through chanting of hymns. According to Buddhist studies scholars Sarah LeVine and David Gellner, Theravada lay devotees traditionally invite the monks into their homes for rites of "protection from evil" and the monk(s) chant the paritrana hymns.&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"/&gt; These rituals are particularly common during rites-of-passage ceremonies such as baby naming, first rice-eating and others.&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarah LeVine |author2=David N Gellner |title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9C1iF3MAYgC |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04012-0|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhologist Karel Werner, some Mahayana and Vajrayana dharani texts influenced the paritta texts of Theravada tradition, such as the Gini (fire) Paritta, as the hymns are identical in parts and the Theravada text uses the same terms, for example, ''"dharani dharaniti"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karel Werner|title=Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMxdAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77461-4|pages=82–83 note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pali canon makes many references to protective (''raksha'', ''paritta'') incantations and magical spells.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt; These invocations provide protection from "malignant spirits, disease and calamity". For example, in ''Digha Nikaya'' (DN I.116.14), Sonadanda remarks that wherever the Buddha stays, "non-humans do not harm the people of that town or village", states the Buddhism scholar Peter Skilling. This and similar statements are also found in the early Chinese translations of Indian Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=skilling110&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter Skilling| title= The ''Raksha'' Literature of the Sravakayana|journal= The Journal of the Pali Text Society|volume=XVI|year=1992|pages=110-111, 116-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skilling, these "protective Buddhist literature" are used by both the monks and the laypeople of Theravada countries. These texts are a part of any "meagre library of Buddhist Sri Lankan households" and they are called ''Pirit Pota''.&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt; In Myanmar, all classes of the Theravada community more widely know about the ''paritta'' incantation literature than any other Pali Buddhist work. The average Theravada monk in other southeast Asian countries who may not know much about a ''[[Tipitaka]]'', states Skilling, is likely to "be able to recite numerous chants [paritta, dharani] from memory".&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt;

In northern Thailand, the ''Suat Boek Phranet'' (lit. Eye-Opening Sutta) is a Pali chant text used during rites such as the consecration of a Buddha image. The text, states Donald Swearer, includes a "unique dharani in praise of the Buddha" and his victory over the evil Mara.&lt;ref name="Swearer2004"/&gt; Though the dharani appears at the end of the text and the associated chant in Thai Buddhist practice occurs at the close of the ceremony, they highlight their key role in "the ''buddhabhiseka'' ritual".&lt;ref name="Swearer2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

According to languages and ancient manuscripts scholar Ernst Wolff, "it was Buddhism, above all, that eminently stimulated and sustained printing activities". Its chants and ideas were in demand in East Asia, and this led to the development of wood-block based mass printing technology. The oldest known dharanis were mass produced by the 8th-century, and later in the 10th-century the canonical ''[[Tripitaka]]'' in addition to 84,000 copies of dharanis were mass printed.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Wolff|editor1=Allen Kent|editor2=Harold Lancour|editor3=Jay E.

{{Disability}}
'''Disability studies''' is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of [[disability]]. Initially the field focused on the division between "impairment" and "disability", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a [[social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=MLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Session Details: Avenues of Access: The State of Disability Studies|url=http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=570&amp;year=2013|website=Modern Language Association|publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the [[Social model of disability|social]] and [[medical model of disability|medical]] models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field.&lt;ref name=Models1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickenbacha|first1=Jerome E|last2=Chatterji|first2=Somnath|last3=Badley|first3=E.M.|last4=Üstün|first4=T.B.|title=Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1999|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1173–1187|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953698004419%20/%20bbib10|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged.&lt;ref name=MLA/&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-social"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=Guy|last2=Karen|first2=Clarke|last3=Randallb|first3=Dave|last4=Rouncefield|first4=Mark|last5=Sommerville|first5=Ian|title=The anti‐social model of disability|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=Oct 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/0968759042000181776|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.9006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs&gt;{{cite web|title=what is disability studies?|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/what_is_ds|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent investigations suggest using "cross-sectional markers of stratification"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siordia | first1 = C | year = 2014 | title = Disability Prevalence According to a Class, Race, and Sex (CRS) Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Racial &amp; Ethnic Health Disparities | volume =  2| issue = 3| pages =  303–310| doi = 10.1007/s40615-014-0073-8 | pmid = 26539340 | pmc = 4628829}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.

Disability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to [[civil rights]] and improving their [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=CAPUZZI SIMON|first1=CECILIA|title=Disability Studies: A New Normal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]].&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415914703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the [[Modern Language Association]] established disability studies as a “division of study.” &lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==History==
Universities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]]&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory/&gt; and its journal "[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the "Disability Studies Reader" Lennard J. Davis wrote that "it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities".&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that "all that has changed", but "just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415953337|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.&lt;ref name=DSQ:ProgramReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multinational Review Of English-Language Disability Studies Degrees And Courses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/issue/view/41|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i3.940 | last1 = Cushing | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Smith | first2 = Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[New York Times]] article "Disability Studies: A New Normal" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=Allegra|last2=Schwartz|first2=Ariel|title="It'll Grow Organically and Naturally": The Reciprocal Relationship between Student Groups and Disability Studies on College Campuses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2014|volume=34|issue=2|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4253/3593|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the transnational&lt;ref name=SDSAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://disstudies.org/about|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society for Disability Studies]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach.  Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.  Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.

*Challenging the view of disability as an individual deficit or defect that can be remedied solely through medical intervention or rehabilitation by "experts" and other service providers.  Rather, a program in Disability Studies should explore models and theories that examine social, political, cultural, and economic factors that define disability and help determine personal and collective responses to difference. At the same time, Disability Studies should work to de-stigmatize disease, illness, and impairment, including those that cannot be measured or explained by biological science.  Finally, while acknowledging that medical research and intervention can be useful, Disability Studies should interrogate the connections between medical practice and stigmatizing disability.
*Studying national and international perspectives, policies, literature, culture, and history with an aim of placing current ideas of disability within their broadest possible context.  Since attitudes toward disability have not been the same across times and places, much can be gained by learning from these other experiences.
*Encouraging participation by disabled students and faculty, and ensuring physical and intellectual access. Prioritizing leadership positions held by disabled people; at the same time, it is important to create an environment where contributions from anyone who shares the above goals are welcome."&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disability studies and medical humanities==
The [[social model of disability]] is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the [[medical humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garden|first=R|title=Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities|journal=Medical Humanities|date=December 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=70–4|pmid=21393285|doi=10.1136/jmh.2010.004143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. [[Infinite Ability]] has done some preliminary work in [[India]] to introduce disability studies to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Khosla, J |author3=Sridhar, S |title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2012|volume=54|issue=3|pages=296–7|pmid=23226869|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.102461|pmc=3512382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|author2=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian Medical Journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability|journal=Medical Education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|page=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersectionality==
[[Feminism]] introduces the inclusion of [[intersectionality]] in disability studies. It focuses on [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Class (social)|class]] and other related systems of [[oppression]] that can also intersect with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillborn|first=David|date=2015|title=Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism: Race, Class, Gender, and Disability in Education.|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–287|doi=10.1177/1077800414557827}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tina Goethals|first=|last2=Elisabeth De Schauwer|last3=Geert Van Hove|date=|year=2015|title=Weaving Intersectionality into Disability Studies Research: Inclusion, Reflexivity and Anti-Essentialism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:000f48af9d031f8db8036895074aa270|journal=Digest. Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies|language=en|volume=2|pages=75|doi=10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research on intersectionality and disability has focused on the aspect of being part of two or more stigmatized groups and how these are contributing factors to multiple forms of harassment, the paradox known as "Double Jeopardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Linda R.|last2=Chan|first2=Fong|last3=McMahon|first3=Brian T.|date=2011-12-29|title=Intersectionality and Disability Harassment|journal=Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=82–91|doi=10.1177/0034355211431167|issn=0034-3552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
Recent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race. Ellen Samuels explores [[Gender studies|gender]], queer sexualities, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstudies.wisc.edu/professional-pages/samuels.htm|title=Department of Gender and Women's Studies|date=2013-02-27|publisher=Womenstudies.wisc.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/resources/feministdisabilitystudies.aspx|title=Women and Disability: Feminist Disability Studies [Disability Studies&amp;#93;|publisher=Disabilitystudies.syr.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bell (scholar)|Christopher Bell]]’s posthumous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca/2009/12/obituary-chris-bell-disability-studies.html|title=Media dis&amp;dat: Obituary: Chris Bell, disability studies scholar on race, HIV/AIDS, dies|author=BA Haller|date=2009-12-26|publisher=Media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; volume on ''Blackness and Disability'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2N8uMz6g02gC|title=Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions - Google Boeken|year=2011|isbn=9783643101266|accessdate=2013-05-07|last1=Bell|first1=Christopher M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Robert McRuer]] both explore [[Queer theory|queerness]] and disability. These works engage with issues of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic oppression. Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] and Alison Kafer. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell’s "Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness" signalled a new direction of research — studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially "othered" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics. Empirical studies show that minority students are disproportionately more likely to be removed from class or school for "behavioral" or academic reasons, and far more likely to be labeled with intellectual or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies(DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors propose a union of critical race and disability studies, DisCrit, as an intersectional approach designed to analyzing the interaction between ableism, sexism, and racism.

In addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies.&lt;ref name="SDSBell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|title=chris bell memorial scholarship|website=Society for Disability Studies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160435/https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the [[intersectionality]] of oppression.  The [[University of Manitoba]] offers a course in on "Women with disabilities".&lt;ref name="ManitobaCourses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/disability_studies/contents/courses.html|title=Disability Studies Courses|website=University of Manitoba|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent masters' student research papers at [[York University]] focus on issues related to women with disabilities and people of African descent with disabilities.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdis.gradstudies.yorku.ca/ma/mrp/|title=COMPLETED MA PROJECT RESEARCH PAPERS|website=York University|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Feminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by "its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment". Garland-Thomson further describes that "identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie. "Integrating disability, transforming feminist theory." NWSA journal 14.3 (2002): 1-32|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism works towards [[accessibility]] for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a [[minority group|minority]]. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. [[Sara Ahmed]] elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in "Atmospheric Walls", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ahmed, Sara N. "Atmospheric Walls." Feministkilljoys. N.p., 2014. Web. 10 Oct. 2016|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerschick|first=Thomas J.|date=2000-07-01|title=Toward a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1263–1268|doi=10.1086/495558|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkerson|first=Abby|date=2002|title=Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|jstor=4316923|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=33–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
The intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It was only in 1973 that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=4|pages=565–575|pmc=4695779|pmid=26690228|doi=10.3390/bs5040565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) changed the listing of transgender to “gender dysphoria”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case ''[[In re Guardianship of Kowalski]]'', in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/us/gay-groups-are-rallied-to-aid-2-women-s-fight.html|title=Gay Groups Are Rallied To Aid 2 Women's Fight|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/us/disabled-woman-s-care-given-to-lesbian-partner.html|title=Disabled Woman's Care Given to Lesbian Partner|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.

A 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first=Karen I.|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun-Jun|last3=Barkan|first3=Susan E.|date=2012|title=Disability Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults: Disparities in Prevalence and Risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490559/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e16–e21|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300379|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490559|pmid=22095356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Though these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of "coming out" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Addressing Disability Stigma within the Lesbian Community|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43888838/Lesbian___Disability.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539886805&amp;Signature=JzL0VYPNkGAJAKigLgay9NP0i%2F0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAddressing_Disability_Stigma_within_the.pdf|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=81|pages=49–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coming out" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of "Double Jeopardy", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.

[[Queer studies]] which emerged from [[women's studies]], brings light towards the different kind of oppression [[queer]] and [[transgender]] people with disabilities have. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] dismisses [[gender disphoria]] because of its moral case against transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry |first=Kevin M. |title=Disabilityqueer: Federal Disability Rights Protection for Transgender People |date=February 18, 2014 |journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol16/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as “Crip” and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McRuer |first=Robert |title=Cripping Queer Politics, or the Dangers of Neoliberalism |website=S&amp;F Online |url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/cripping-queer-politics-or-the-dangers-of-neoliberalism/ |issue=10.1–10.2 |date=Fall 2011 – Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, "Feminist Queer Crip". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and "an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, queer, crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253009227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3GPb2obU0gC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Crip+Theory:+Cultural+Signs+of+Queerness+and+Disability#v=onepage&amp;q=Crip%20Theory:%20Cultural%20Signs%20of%20Queerness%20and%20Disability&amp;f=false|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|date=2006-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814761090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term "differing abilities", describes the label disability as  "a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Disabilities" vs. "Differing Abilities" |url=https://www.melwood.org/disabilities-vs-differing-abilities|website=Melwood|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the [[ableism]] that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society "as a structure for people who have no weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendell |first=Susan |title=Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability |journal=Hypatia |volume=4 |number=2 |year=1989 |pages=104–124 |jstor=3809809 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.

=== Social class ===
Within class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability. Disability looks different from a middle class, upper class, and lower class perspective, as well as through race, gender, and ethnicity. One's social class can contribute to when a person becomes disabled, rather it be sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F4X6yaiCNOcC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Feminist,+Queer,+Crip#v=onepage&amp;q=Feminist,%20Queer,%20Crip&amp;f=false|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2013-05-16|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253009418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where there is poverty we will find disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2zYEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Disability+Studies:+An+Interdisciplinary+Introduction#v=onepage&amp;q=Disability%20Studies:%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Introduction&amp;f=false|title=Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction|last=Goodley|first=Dan|date=2016-11-03|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473986930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poverty can include social, economic, and cultural poverty. Having a disability can contribute to poverty just as poverty can contribute to having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poverty and Disability: A Survey of the Literature|last=Elwan|first=Ann|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and be unemployed than those who do not, resulting in lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/disability.aspx|title=Disability &amp; Socioeconomic Status|last=|first=|date=|website=apa.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Questioning the social model===
The International Association of Accessibility Professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies|url=http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationprofoutline|website=International Association of Accessibility Professionals|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the '''social''' model of disability &lt;ref name=Models1999 /&gt; has recently{{When|date=January 2018}} been challenged.&lt;ref name="anti-social" /&gt; In a 2014 ''Disability Studies Quarterly'' article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and "question the rejection of the '''medical''' model" of disability.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups/&gt; The '''cultural affiliation''' model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=J|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|date=1994|publisher=Broadway Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''economic''' model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strnadová|first1=I|last2=Cumming,|first2=Therese|title=Lifespan transitions and disability : A holistic perspective|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the '''charity''' model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.  The '''functional solutions''' model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html |title=Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators |publisher=.ed.gov |date= 2018-09-25|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of cognitive and mental disabilities===
There is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of ''mental illness.'' However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Carol|title=Sociologies of disability and illness : contested ideas in disability studies and medical sociology|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403936363|page=131|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, [[Lancaster University]], this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities.  The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.

It is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship “psychological impairment” can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  Scholars such as [[Peter Beresford]] (2002) suggest "the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'" which would consider impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Yet others may recommend the "embodied approach," to the study of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - How They Met Themselves (1860-64 circa).jpg|thumb|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], ''How They Met Themselves'', watercolor, 1864|305px]]
A '''doppelgänger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|əl|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|əɹ|,_|-|g|æ|ŋ|əɹ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔpl̩ˌɡɛŋɐ|lang|De-doppelgaenger.ogg}}, literally "double-goer") is a non-biologically related [[look-alike]] or double of a living person, sometimes portrayed as a ghostly or [[paranormal]] phenomenon and usually seen as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an [[evil twin]]. In modern times, the term '''twin stranger''' is occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|title=See what happened when 3 friends set out to find their ‘twin stranger’|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906134813/https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|archivedate=2017-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3994274/Identical-strangers-brought-Finding-Twin-Stranger.html|title=Identical strangers are brought together|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20161202192206/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article%2D3994274/Identical%2Dstrangers%2Dbrought%2DFinding%2DTwin%2DStranger.html|archivedate=2016-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "doppelgänger" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person.

==Spelling==
The word ''doppelgänger'' is a [[loanword]] from the German ''Doppelgänger'', a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns ''Doppel'' (double) and ''Gänger'' (walker or goer).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger Doppelgänger; Orthography, Meaning Synonyms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120074951/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger |date=2012-11-20 }} http://www.duden.de {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AeW56Irr?url=http://www.duden.de/ |date=2012-09-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural "doppelgängers". The first known use, in the slightly different form ''Doppeltgänger'', occurs in the novel ''[[Siebenkäs]]'' (1796) by [[Jean Paul]], in which he explains his [[neologism|newly coined word]] by a [[footnote]] – while actually the word ''Doppelgänger'' also appears, but with a quite different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pleasures of Abandonment: Jean Paul and the Life of Humor |author=Paul Fleming |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-8260-3247-9 |page=126, footnote 13 |quote=In one of the stranger twists of fate in literary history, Jean Paul coins two terms in ''Siebenkäs'', "Doppelgänger" and "Doppeltgänger." The term Jean Paul uses to describe Siebenkäs and Leibgeber is "Doppeltgänger," which he defines in a footnote: "So heißen Leute, die sich selber sehen" ["the name for people who see themselves"] (2, 67). Earlier in ''Siebenkäs'' the neologism "Doppelgänger" also appears for the first time and means something quite different. In a description of the wedding banquet in the first chapter, the food is so delicious and abundant that "not only was one course [''Gang''] served but also a second, a {{italics correction|''Doppelgänger''}}" ["nicht bloß ''ein'' Gang aufgetragen wurde, sondern ein zweiter, ein Doppelgänger"] (2, 42). "Gang" in German has multiple meanings, ranging from a "walk" to the "course" of a meal; according to Jean Paul, when people "see themselves," when one "goes twice," one is a "Doppeltgänger"; when one has a meal of two courses, in which the second doesn't come second but together with the first, this is a "Doppelgänger."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[noun]]s in German, the word is written with an initial [[capital letter]]. ''Doppelgänger'' and ''Doppelgaenger'' are essentially equivalent spellings, and ''Doppelganger'' is different and would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title. It is further common to drop the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut]] on the letter "a", writing (and often pronouncing) "doppelganger".

==Mythology==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. [[Francis Grose]]'s, ''Provincial Glossary'' of 1787 used the term ''[[fetch (folklore)|fetch]]'' instead, defined as the "apparition of a person living." [[Catherine Crowe]]'s book on paranormal phenomena, ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of [[alter ego]]s and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian mythology]], a ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' was a tangible "spirit double" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. ''The Greek Princess'' presents an Egyptian view of the [[Trojan War]] in which a ''ka'' of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. This is depicted in [[Euripides]]' play [[Helen (play)|''Helen'']]. In [[Norse mythology]], a ''[[vardøger]]'' is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In [[Finnish mythology]], this is called having an ''[[etiäinen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ganander, Christfrid.

==Examples==



[[Izaak Walton]] claimed that English [[metaphysical poet]] [[John Donne]] saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Izaak. ''Life of Dr. John Donne.'' Fourth edition, 1675. Cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;

German playwright [[Goethe]] described an experience in his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' in which he and his double passed one another on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Wolfgang von Goethe.'' Translated by John Oxenford. Horizon Press, 1969. This example cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s drama ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' makes reference to a dead child who "met his own image walking in the garden".&lt;ref&gt;''Prometheus Unbound'', lines 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lord Byron]] uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.&lt;ref name="Burwick2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Burwick|title=Playing to the Crowd: London Popular Theatre, 1780-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37065-4|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Devil's Elixir]] (1815), a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. T. A., ''The Devil's Elixers (English Translation)''. London, T. Cadell, Publishers, 1829; url=https://archive.org/details/devilselixirfrom01hoffuoft/page/n3&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s early novels.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' (1846) presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams']] ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Williams, ''Descent into Hell'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Barker]]'s story "Human Remains" in his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of [[Gothic fiction]].

Criminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on [[eyewitness testimony]]. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Emily O'Hara.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20896">'''Dynamical systems theory''' is an area of [[mathematics]] used to describe the behavior of the  [[complex systems|complex]] [[dynamical system]]s, usually by employing [[differential equations]] or [[difference equations]]. When differential equations are employed, the theory is called [[continuous time|''continuous dynamical systems'']]. From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of [[classical mechanics]], a generalization where the [[equations of motion]] are postulated directly and are not constrained to be [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s of a [[Principle of least action|least action principle]]. When difference equations are employed, the theory is called [[discrete time|''discrete dynamical systems'']]. When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a [[cantor set]], one gets [[dynamic equations on time scales]]. Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as [[differential-difference equations]].

Much of modern research is focused on the study of [[chaotic system]]s.

This field of study is also called just ''dynamical systems'', ''mathematical dynamical systems theory'' or the ''mathematical theory of dynamical systems''.

== Overview ==
Dynamical systems theory and [[chaos theory]] deal with the long-term qualitative behavior of [[dynamical system]]s. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible steady states?", or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

An important goal is to describe the fixed points, or steady states of a given dynamical system; these are values of the variable that don't change over time. Some of these fixed points are ''attractive'', meaning that if the system starts out in a nearby state, it converges towards the fixed point.

Similarly, one is interested in ''periodic points'', states of the system that repeat after several timesteps. Periodic points can also be attractive. [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] is an interesting statement about the number of periodic points of a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system.

Even simple [[nonlinear dynamical system]]s often exhibit seemingly random behavior that has been called ''chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grebogi |first=C. |last2=Ott |first2=E. |last3=Yorke |first3=J. |year=1987 |title=Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=238 |issue=4827 |pages=632–638 |jstor=1700479 |doi=10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of dynamical systems that deals with the clean definition and investigation of chaos is called ''[[chaos theory]]''.

== History ==
The concept of dynamical systems theory has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future.

Before the advent of [[computer|fast computing machines]], solving a dynamical system required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could only be accomplished for a small class of dynamical systems.

Some excellent presentations of mathematical dynamic system theory include {{harv|Beltrami|1990}}, {{harv|Luenberger|1979}}, {{harv|Padulo|Arbib|1974}}, and {{harv|Strogatz|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome R. Busemeyer (2008), [http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html "Dynamic Systems"]. To Appear in: ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science'', Macmillan. Retrieved 8 May 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613053119/http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Dynamical systems ===
{{main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
The [[dynamical system]] concept is a mathematical [[formal system|formalization]] for any fixed "rule" that describes the [[time]] dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each spring in a lake.

A dynamical system has a ''state'' determined by a collection of [[real numbers]], or more generally by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Point (geometry)|points]] in an appropriate ''state space''.  Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers.  The numbers are also the coordinates of a geometrical space—a [[manifold]].   The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state.  The rule may be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] (for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state) or [[stochastic differential equation|stochastic]] (the evolution of the state is subject to random shocks).

=== Dynamicism ===
[[Dynamicism]], also termed the ''dynamic hypothesis'' or the ''dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science'' or ''dynamic cognition'', is a new approach in [[cognitive science]] exemplified by the work of philosopher [[Tim van Gelder]]. It argues that [[differential equations]] are more suited to modelling [[cognition]] than more traditional [[computer]] models.

=== Nonlinear system ===
{{main|Nonlinear system}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[nonlinear system]] is a system that is not [[linear system|linear]]—i.e., a system that does not satisfy the [[superposition principle]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"/&gt; Less technically, a nonlinear system is any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. A [[Homogeneity (physics)|nonhomogeneous]] system, which is linear apart from the presence of a function of the [[independent variable]]s, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such systems are usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to a linear system as long as a particular solution is known.

== Related fields ==

=== Arithmetic dynamics ===
:[[Arithmetic dynamics]] is a field that emerged in the 1990s that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, [[dynamical systems]] and [[number theory]]. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the [[Iterated function|iteration]] of self-maps of the [[complex plane]] or [[real line]]. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].

=== Chaos theory ===
:[[Chaos theory]] describes the behavior of certain [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]]s – that is, systems whose state evolves with time – that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions (popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]). As a result of this sensitivity, which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions, the behavior of chaotic systems appears [[randomness|random]]. This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic]], meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply ''chaos''.

=== Complex systems ===
:[[Complex systems]] is a scientific field that studies the common properties of [[system]]s considered [[Complexity|complex]] in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]]. It is also called ''complex systems theory'', ''complexity science'', ''study of complex systems'' and/or ''sciences of complexity''. The key problems of such systems are  difficulties with their formal [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]]. From such perspective, in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes.

:The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical [[reductionist]] strategy has fallen short. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including [[neurosciences]], [[social sciences]], [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[economics]], earthquake prediction, [[molecular biology]] and inquiries into the nature of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s themselves.

=== Control theory ===
:[[Control theory]] is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], that deals with influencing the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s.

=== Ergodic theory ===
:[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies [[dynamical system]]s with an [[invariant measure]] and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of [[statistical physics]].

=== Functional analysis ===
:[[Functional analysis]] is the branch of [[mathematics]], and specifically of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], concerned with the study of [[vector space]]s and [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of [[functional space]]s, in particular transformations of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], such as the [[Fourier transform]], as well as in the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]]. This usage of the word ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' goes back to the [[calculus of variations]], implying a function whose argument is a function. Its use in general has been attributed to mathematician and physicist [[Vito Volterra]] and its founding is largely attributed to mathematician [[Stefan Banach]].

=== Graph dynamical systems ===
:The concept of [[graph dynamical system]]s (GDS) can be used to capture a wide range of processes taking place on graphs or networks. A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of graph dynamical systems is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result.

=== Projected dynamical systems ===
:[[Projected dynamical systems]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory investigating the behaviour of [[dynamical system]]s where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems and the dynamical world of [[ordinary differential equations]]. A projected dynamical system is given by the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] to the projected differential equation.

=== Symbolic dynamics ===
:[[Symbolic dynamics]] is the practice of modelling a topological or smooth [[dynamical system]] by a discrete space consisting of infinite [[sequence]]s of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a state of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the [[shift operator]].

=== System dynamics ===
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behaviour of systems over time.  It deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behaviour and state of the entire system.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163801/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].  These elements help describe how even seemingly simple systems display baffling [[nonlinearity]].

=== Topological dynamics ===
:[[Topological dynamics]] is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied from the viewpoint of [[general topology]].

== Applications ==

=== In biomechanics ===
In [[sports biomechanics]], dynamical systems theory has emerged in the movement sciences as a viable framework for modeling athletic performance. From a dynamical systems perspective, the human movement system is a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) that are composed of a large number of interacting components (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle tissue, metabolic enzymes, connective tissue and bone). In dynamical systems theory, movement patterns emerge through generic processes of self-organization found in physical and biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S Glazier, Keith Davids, Roger M Bartlett (2003). [http://www.sportsci.org/jour/03/psg.htm "DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY: a Relevant Framework for Performance-Oriented Sports Biomechanics Research"]. in: Sportscience 7. Accessed 2008-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no research validation of any of the claims associated to the conceptual application of this framework.

=== In cognitive science ===
Dynamical system theory has been applied in the field of [[neurodynamics|neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive development]], especially in [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. It is the belief that cognitive development is best represented by physical theories rather than theories based on syntax and [[AI]]. It also believed that differential equations are the most appropriate tool for modeling human behavior. These equations are interpreted to represent an agent's cognitive trajectory through [[state space]]. In other words, dynamicists argue that [[psychology]] should be (or is) the description (via differential equations) of the cognitions and behaviors of an agent under certain environmental and internal pressures. The language of chaos theory is also frequently adopted.

In it, the learner's mind reaches a state of disequilibrium where old patterns have broken down. This is the phase transition of cognitive development. [[Self-organization]] (the spontaneous creation of coherent forms) sets in as activity levels link to each other. Newly formed macroscopic and microscopic structures support each other, speeding up the process. These links form the structure of a new state of order in the mind through a process called ''scalloping'' (the repeated building up and collapsing of complex performance.) This new, novel state is progressive, discrete, idiosyncratic and unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promise of Dynamic Systems Approaches for an Integrated Account of Human Development|journal=Child Development|date=2000-02-25|first=Mark D.|last=Lewis|volume=71|issue=1|pages=36–43|id= |url=http://home.oise.utoronto.ca/~mlewis/Manuscripts/Promise.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00116|pmid=10836556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic systems theory has recently been used to explain a long-unanswered problem in child development referred to as the [[A-not-B error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2003-07-30|first=Linda B.|last=Smith|author2=Esther Thelen|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–8|id= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/labwork/dynamicsystem.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In second language development===
{{Main|Dynamic approach to second language development}}
The application of Dynamic Systems Theory to study [[second language acquisition]] is attributed to [[Diane Larsen-Freeman]] who published an article in 1997 in which she claimed that [[second language acquisition]] should be viewed as a developmental process which includes [[language attrition]] as well as language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article-abstract/18/2/141/134192|title=Chaos/Complexity Science and Second Language Acquisition|date=1997|publisher=Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article she claimed that language should be viewed as a dynamic system which is dynamic, complex, nonlinear, chaotic, unpredictable, sensitive to initial conditions, open, self-organizing, feedback sensitive, and adaptive.

'''[[Torture]]''' has been used throughout history for the purpose of obtaining information in [[interrogation]]. Torture, while widely illegal and a violation of international law, has been frequently cited as generating false or misleading information, and lacks scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The counterargument points to some specific cases{{which|date=September 2018}} where torture has elicited true information.

== Historical Examples of the Use of Torture ==

=== Judicial Use of Torture ===

====17th century====

One early writer on the ineffectiveness of torture was [[Friedrich Spee]] (1591-1635). Spee was a [[Germany|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8139-2182-1}}. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1GMTaUuzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi)] contains many details on Spee's life.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

=== Military Use of Torture ===

====World War II====

After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II, the Japanese military tortured a captured American [[P-51]] [[fighter pilot]], Marcus McDilda,  in order to discover how many [[atomic bombs]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who knew nothing about the atomic bomb nor the [[Manhattan Project]], "confessed" under torture that the U.S. had 100 atomic bombs and that [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]] were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' [[Surrender of Japan|decision to surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jerome T. Hagen| title=War in the Pacific, Chapter 25 "The Lie of Marcus McDilda"| publisher= Hawaii Pacific University| year=1996| ISBN=978-0-9653927-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/opinion/blood-on-our-hands.html |title=Blood On Our Hands? |first=Nicholas |last=Kristof |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |date=5 August 2003 |accessdate=20 May 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean War====
Chinese interrogators tortured U.S. Air Force prisoners of war during the [[Korean War]] with the specific goal of eliciting false confessions.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/02detain.html |title=China Inspired Interrogations at Guantánamo|last1=Shane |first1=Scott |authorlink=Scott Shane |date=July 2, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, these false confessions led to allegations that the airmen had been "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]", so the United States interviewed the former prisoners of war to collect information on the torture techniques employed, publishing their results in 1957.&lt;ref name=Biderman&gt;{{cite journal |title=Communist Attempts to Elicit False Confessions from Air Force Prisoners of War |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1806204/pdf/bullnyacadmed00378-0046.pdf |first=Albert D. |last=Biderman |work=[[Journal of Urban Health|Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine]] |date=September 1957 |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=616–625 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These torture techniques were incorporated into the [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) program to train servicemembers to resist torture.&lt;ref name=china /&gt;

====1992 U.S. Army Field Manual====
[[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]], the [[United States Army Field Manuals|United States Army field manual]], explains that torture "is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=United States Department of the Army |authorlink=United States Department of the Army |title=FM 34-52: Intelligence Interrogation |date=28 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is torture ineffective at gathering reliable information, but it also increases the difficulty of gathering information from a source in the future.

====War on Terror and 2003 invasion of Iraq====

Directed by Michael Kirk. [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]. March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the revelations in 2004 and 2008 that the President [[George W. Bush]] administration [[Torture Memos|authorized the use of torture]] in interrogations, and that United States personnel have used such practices in interrogations related to the [[9/11 attacks]] and [[al-Qaeda]], both at [[black sites]] and at [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]], discussions on this topic have been heated. In commenting on the use and effectiveness of various torture methods, with a focus on [[waterboarding]], former U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[Dennis C. Blair]], wrote in 2009 that "high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=0|title=Interrogations' Effectiveness May Prove Elusive|work=[[New York Times]]|date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a Senate Committee that investigated claims of useful information being extracted from suspects that underwent enhanced interrogation concluded that critical and valuable information was not obtained using these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/jan/26/does-torture-work-and-is-it-worth-the-cost-donald-trump|title=Does torture work – and is it worth the cost?|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=26 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5,700-page [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] also concluded that the CIA repeatedly and deliberately impeded oversight, as well as misrepresenting the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique to policymakers and to the public through coordinated [[news leak|leaking]] of false information.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself&gt;{{cite web

Alex Knapp, a staff writer at ''[[Forbes]],'' wrote the following in 2009, "Time and time again, people with actual experience with interrogating terror suspects and actual experience and knowledge about the effectiveness of torture techniques have come out to explain that they are ineffective and that their use threatens national security more than it helps".&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/an_fbi_interrogator_on_the_effectiveness_of_torture/ |title=An FBI Interrogator on the Effectiveness of Torture |publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had written an article about an FBI interrogator, who noted their practice did not include torture; FBI agents had registered strong disapproval of the US military approach.&lt;ref name="knapp"/&gt;

Annette Sisco argues that "the [torture] techniques... are specifically designed to make captives pliable and dependent. They are designed to get prisoners to say whatever you want them to say".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Annette Sisco |url=http://blog.nola.com/guesteditorials/2009/04/how_effective_is_torture_not_v.html |title=How effective is torture?

The book ''Physicians at War: the Dual-Loyalties Challenge'' by Fritz Allhoff explains that "to test the effectiveness of torture researchers would have to ignore the consent of the research subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2BDGSZ0qJEC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Effectiveness+of+torture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mqXYTtH3EJDSmAWDpY3fCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Effectiveness%20of%20torture&amp;f=false |title=Physicians at war: the dual-loyalties challenge|editor=Fritz Allhoff|via=Google Books |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date= 2008|isbn=9781402069123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, classicality is described as an emergent property induced in [[open quantum system]]s by their environments. Due to the [[interaction]] with the environment, the vast majority of states in the [[Hilbert space]] of a quantum open system become highly unstable due to entangling interaction with the environment, which in effect monitors selected observables of the system. After a [[decoherence]] time, which for macroscopic objects is typically many orders of magnitude shorter than any other dynamical timescale,&lt;ref name="zurek04"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0302044|last1= Zurek|first1= Wojciech H.|title= Reduction of the Wavepacket: How Long Does it Take? |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generic quantum state decays into an [[density matrix|uncertain state]] which can be decomposed into a mixture of simple [[pointer states]]. In this way the environment induces effective superselection rules. Thus, einselection precludes stable existence of pure superpositions of pointer states.  These '[[pointer states]]' are stable despite environmental interaction. The einselected states lack coherence, and therefore do not exhibit the quantum behaviours of [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] and [[quantum superposition|superposition]].

Advocates of this approach argue that since only quasi-local, essentially classical states survive the decoherence process, einselection can in many ways explain the emergence of a (seemingly) classical reality in a fundamentally quantum universe (at least to local observers). However, the basic program has been criticized as relying on a circular argument (e.g. [[R. E. Kastner]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kastner |first=R. E. |year=2014 |title=Einselection' of Pointer Observables: the New H-Theorem? |journal=[[Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics]] |volume=48 |pages=56 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/10757/1/Einselection_and_HThm_Final.pdf|bibcode=2014SHPMP..48...56K |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2014.06.004 |arxiv=1406.4126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). So the question of whether the 'einselection' account can really explain the phenomenon of wave function collapse remains unsettled.

==Definition==
Zurek has defined einselection as follows "[[Quantum decoherence|Decoherence]] leads to einselection when the [[quantum state|states]] of the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] &lt;math&gt;|\epsilon_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different pointer states become orthogonal:
&lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon_i|\epsilon_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;",&lt;ref name="zurek03"/&gt;

==Details==
Einselected pointer states are distinguished by their ability to persist in spite of the environmental monitoring and therefore are the ones in which quantum open systems are observed. Understanding the nature of these states and the process of their dynamical selection is of fundamental importance. This process has been studied first in a measurement situation: When the system is an apparatus whose intrinsic dynamics can be neglected, pointer states turn out to be [[eigenstates]] of the interaction [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] between the apparatus and its environment.&lt;ref name="zurek05"&gt;

Pointer states result from the interplay between self-evolution and environmental monitoring.

To study einselection, an operational definition of pointer states has been introduced.&lt;ref name="zurek06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zurek |first=W. H. |year=1993 |journal=[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=281–312 |doi=10.1143/ptp/89.2.281 |title=Preferred States, Predictability, Classicality and the Environment-Induced Decoherence|bibcode=1993PThPh..89..281Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zurek |first1=W.

This is the "predictability sieve" criterion, based on an intuitive idea: ''Pointer states'' can be defined as the ones which become minimally entangled with the environment in the course of their evolution. The predictability sieve criterion is a way to quantify this idea by using the following algorithmic procedure: For every initial pure state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, one measures the [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] generated dynamically between the system and the environment by computing the entropy:
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal {H}_\Psi (t)= -\operatorname{Tr} \left ( \rho_\Psi(t) \log \rho_\Psi(t) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
or some other measure of predictability &lt;ref name="zurek06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek08"&gt;

The entropy is a function of time and a functional of the initial state &lt;math&gt;\left | \Psi \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Pointer states are obtained by minimizing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal {H}_\Psi\,&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\left | \Psi \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and demanding that the answer be robust when varying the time &lt;math&gt;  t\ &lt;/math&gt;.

The nature of pointer states has been investigated using the predictability sieve criterion only for a limited number of examples.&lt;ref name="zurek06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zurek08"/&gt; Apart from the already mentioned case of the measurement situation (where pointer states are simply eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian) the most notable example is that of a quantum [[Brownian]] particle coupled through its position with a bath of independent [[harmonic oscillators]]. In such case pointer states are localized in [[phase space]], even though the interaction Hamiltonian involves the position of the particle.&lt;ref name="zurek07"/&gt; Pointer states are the result of the interplay between self-evolution and interaction with the environment and turn out to be coherent states.

There is also a [[quantum limit]] of decoherence: When the spacing between [[energy levels]] of the system is large compared to the [[frequencies]] present in the environment, [[energy eigenstates]] are einselected nearly independently of the nature of the system-environment coupling.&lt;ref name="zurek82"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paz |first=J. P. |last2=Zurek |first2=W. H. |year=1999 |title=Quantum limit of decoherence: Environment induced superselection of energy eigenstates |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=82 |issue=26 |pages=5181–5185 |arxiv=quant-ph/9811026 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.82.5181|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82.5181P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collisional decoherence ==

There has been significant work on correctly identifying the pointer states in the case of a massive particle decohered by collisions with a fluid environment, often known as ''collisional decoherence''.  In particular, Busse and Hornberger have identified certain solitonic wavepackets as being unusually stable in the presence of such decoherence.&lt;ref name="busse2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0905.4609 |last1=Busse |first1=M. |title=Emergence of pointer states in a non-perturbative environment |journal=[[Journal of Physics A]] |volume=42 |issue=36 |pages=362001 |last2=Hornberger |first2=K. |year=2009 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/42/36/362001 |bibcode=2009JPhA...42J2001B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busse2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0910.1062 |last1=Busse |first1=M. |title=Pointer basis induced by collisional decoherence |journal=[[Journal of Physics A]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=015303 |last2=Hornberger |first2=K. |year=2009 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/43/1/015303 |bibcode=2010JPhA...43a5303B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19565">'''Endre Tot''' (Endre TÓT) born in [[Sümeg]], [[Hungary]],1937 is a Hungarian artist who lives and works in [[Cologne]], Germany.

Tot participated in the [[Fluxus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-vautier.com/2007/2007.php3?id_sujet=flux fluxus]&lt;/ref&gt; movement and is well known for his [[Mail art]] projects, the use of xerox copies and usage of rubber stamps with clear [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] text declarations. In some of them Tot declares: "We are glad if we are happy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hundertmark-gallery.com/artist-endre-tot.0.html Endré Tot]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he shows "Who's Afraid of Nothing? Absent images" at [[Museum Ludwig]], Cologne, a continuation of a project called "Nothing is not nothing".

==The 60s – Experiments in Informel==
He studied at the Mural Department of the Hungarian College of Arts and Crafts from 1959 till 1965. He started to make informel paintings, an absolute novelty in Hungary, in the early 60s followed shortly by collages and works executed in the spirit of Pop Art and Minimal Art. He became attached in the mid-60s to a leading but neglected Avant-Garde painter, Dezső Korniss who highly appreciated his pioneering informel ventures. In 1968 and 1969 he joined his young Neo-Avant-Garde colleagues named collectively the Iparterv Group of Artists at two scandalous exhibitions heavily criticised by officialdom. A retrospective of his early works was staged at the Budapest Kiscelli Museum in 1989, his early pencil and ink drawings were shown at Székesfehérvár’s King Stephen Museum in 2003, while a comprehensive exhibition of his early works entitled „Early Works – from painted to unpainted pictures” at the Szombathely Gallery in 2004 presented most of his important works executed before his „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970). After the political turn of 1989-1990 many of his major works executed back in the 60s were acquired by important Hungarian museums.

==The 70s – The Beginnings of Concept Art==
In 1970-71 he broke radically with painting and has since been pre-occupied with Concept Art. „Tót may well have possessed the most phenomenal painter talent among artists living East of Amsterdam. And yet, he voluntarily relinquished painting for the sake of a truth that he had gradually recognised to be even more important than painting.” (Géza Perneczky, writing in Új Művészet, October, 2003) As a farewell to his painter period he prepared his artist’s book „My Unpainted Canvasses” (1970), a virtual presentation of his canvasses never actually accomplished. Also in the early 70s, he evolved some of his basic ideas like "Nothing/Zer0", "Rains and Gladnesses" that were to permeate his works in subsequent decades.
The new media he employed in his art include telegrams, picture postcards, T-shirts, Xerox copies, typewriters, films, music, posters, graffiti, banners, actions, artist’s books, street newsreels.
Critics recognised his early „Absent Works” published by Cologne-based DuMont Verlag ("Aktuelle Kunst in Ost-Europa", 1972) to be the very first conceptual works stemming from Eastern-Europe, works that were to be greatly enhanced in subsequent decades. Some other conceptual works of his were also published in Achille Bonito Oliva’s „Europe/America: The Different Avant-Garde” (Milan, 1976).
„He entered the stage of mail art almost in the very first hour”, wrote J. M. Poison in his catalogue of 1971 entitled „Mail Art-Communication - A Distance-Concept”. His fellow mail art correspondents included his later friend Ben Vautier, John Armleder, George Brecht, Daniel Spoerri, Cosey Fanny Tutti, Genesis P-Orridge, Dieter Roth, Marina Abramovich, Ken Friedmann and his dog. His mail art was exhibited at the Paris Bi-Annual of 1972 together with art by such other mail art pioneers as Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Richard Johnson, Ben Vautier, George Brecht. About his letters written with a zero code Pierre Restany, a friend of Yves Klein’s, wrote this in 1978: „In the immaterial zone of a concentrated (ZEROED) sensitivity Endre Tót appears to be the Yves Klein of mail art, a monochrome of postage.”
His first museum exhibition was staged by the Israel Museum in 1975. Since Hungary had severed its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967, Tót was forced to smuggle his works out of Hungary in an adventurous way. His conceptual works (e.g. his Rainproof-ideas) executed between 1970 and 1974 were exhibited there simultaneously with Alberto Giacometti’s statues. Art magazines in Germany, Italy, and France took note of the exhibition with the Jerusalem Post commenting: "This is not to say that Endre Tot is the same race with Giacometti, but he is a totally new and rewarding experience."
In 1974, the Swiss Howeg Verlag published his sheet of stamps called Zero-Post among the very first artist’s stamps of international mail art.
At the invitation of John Armleder, his later friend who became world-famous for his Neo Geo movement, he spent half a year with the Ecart Gallery of Geneva, an institution also functioning as a mail art centre. It was during his stay in Geneva that he accomplished his first street action (TOTalJoys 1976) which was filmed and later issued on DVD by the Paris Bureau des Videos in 2005.
His artist’s books made in Budapest in the 70s earned him quite a lot of international praise. He had first published them on a samizdat basis but they were later republished by Western-European Avant-Garde publishers. 1971: „My Unpainted Canvasses”,  „The States of Zeros”, „Semmi sem semmi / Nothing ain't Nothing”, 1972: „Nothing”, „Incomplete Informations”, 1974: „Zero-Texts (1971-72)”, „Night Visit to the National Gallery” (Beau Geste Press, UK), „Zero-Post”, „Rainproof Ideas (1971-74)”, 1979: ”TÓTalJOYS”, 1981: ”Very Special Drawings”, 1990: „Evergreen Book”. In 1998, the Paris Bibliothèque Nationale bought several of his artist’s books. The library of the Paris Pompidou Centre acquired his Correspondence avec John Armleder (Ecart, Geneva, 1974) in 2010. His artist’s books were exhibited in many European, American and Canadian museums including the Pompidou Centre’s „Livres d'Artistes” exhibition of 1985.
He was still a resident of Budapest when, in 1977, he exhibited with Galerie Bama, one of the best-known Paris galleries. His show was reviewed in L 'Express by Otto Hahn. Due to his international actions and mail art activities he counted in the West as one of the most notable Eastern-European artists, an appraisal hardly acknowledged in his native country.
He was plucked from the isolation of his Óbuda apartment in the late 70s by an invitation coming from the Berlin Artist Program of DAAD. His applications for an exit permit had been refused by the authorities several times which created a political sensation in the Western press, a circumstance that eventually earned him a permit. After staying in Berlin for a year Tót opted for emigration. His Óbuda apartment was confiscated but his sibling had evacuated his works stored there in the nick of time. After being stored in various low-key places, they were eventually deposited with the Hungarian National Gallery in an orderly fashion.
It was in West-Berlin that Tót came to realise the ideas that he had taken with him in his suitcase and in his mind from Budapest. Shortly after arriving, he placed the following inscription upon the Berlin Wall: „Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ich etwas auf die andere Seite der Mauer schreiben dürfte” (I should be glad if I were allowed to write something on the other side of this wall). He demonstrated his joys ("TÓTalJOYs") with posters in his hand or upon his back in the busiest spots of the metropolis. He even placed a flickering sentence speaking about his joy among the news items of a street newsreel atop a Kurfürstendamm building. In 1978 DAAD filmed and published in book form his street action named TOTalJOYS. He twice exhibited his works with Galerie René Block, an institution previously hosting such notables as Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell. The irony inherent in his actions and mail art definitely links him up with the fluxus movement in Germany. He was the sole Eastern-European protagonist of the itinerant exhibition organised by René Block entitled „Fluxus in Germany 1962-1992”.

==The 80s – Blackout in Cologne==
After a stay of one and a half years in Berlin he moved to Cologne with his German wife Herta. The first years of his Cologne period were much less productive than his stay in Berlin. He hardly ever worked until the mid-80s. Invited by Artist Place, he flew to New York City in 1982 with a piece of chalk in his pocket that he used for placing graffiti on the walls of the gallery. It was here that he met up with a great number of notable artists including Alan Kaprow and his friend of old, John Armleder.
With the „blackout years” gone, as he himself called them, he started to work again feverishly from the late 80s on. He elaborated on the idea of „absent paintings”, an idea dating back to his Budapest years (My Unpainted Canvasses, 1970, Night Visit to the National Gallery, A Visit to the Museum,  both in 1974). With his „absent paintings” he accomplished a virtual return to painting but this was tantamount in his case to its final destruction. The spirit nurturing his Blackout and Catalogued paintings comes from an aesthetics of dearth[1] . Conceived in an aesthetics of disappearance, his „absent” works attempt to visualise nothing and void itself. His large work entitled „Dada Messe in Berlin” was exhibited at the show ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art (ZKM, Karlsruhe, 2002) presenting major iconoclastic works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Duchamp, Malevich, Picabia, Warhol, Beuys etc. At the Bremen exhibition „Who Killed the Painting?” (Museum für Moderne Kunst, 2010) his large triptych „Fluxus Triptichon” (2002, 3 x 200 x 125&amp;nbsp;cm) was on view alongside works by Beuys, Kaprow, Ben Vautier, G. Brecht, Al Hausen, Nam June Paik etc.

==The 90s – Retrospectives and Entering the Canon==
After the political change of 1989-1990 in Hungary Tót returned to his native country with his works created abroad. He filled all 12 exhibiting halls of the Palace of the Arts with them under the evocative title of „Nothing is Nothing”. Four years later he exhibited with the Cologne Ludwig Museum (Who is afraid of Nothing?), and this selection of his works was re-exhibited with the Budapest branch of the Ludwig Museum in 1999. Tót is the first Hungarian artist to have been asked to put on an individual show at the Kassel Documenta. Curators there insisted on using the Hungarian title of his Budapest show (Semmi sem semmi) probably because they liked its exotic sound. His action on the city’s main square involving him distributing flyers with a black mask hiding his face was cut short by the police even though the flyers contained no information at all. Along with his works accomplished in his studio, his street actions have also helped him achieve international fame. 
„I am glad that I have stood here” – this was inscribed in Hungarian on his bronze plaque placed in the pavement in 1998 in front of [[Artpool Art Research Center|Artpool's]] art space in Budapest (60, Paulay Ede St.). Six years later a similarly inscribed plaque („Ich freue mich, dass ich hier gestanden habe”) was placed in the floor of the roof terrace of the Cologne Ludwig Museum. 
His Flyer, Zero, Joy etc. street actions as satellite events to international exhibitions have embarrassed or enraged passers-by in many cities over the decades, not infrequently causing even the police to intervene. International critics usually evaluate those anti-demonstrations by Tót to be responses to the mandatory political demonstrations that he had lived through as a young man in totalitarian Hungary.

==The 2000s==
A photo documentation of Tót’s earliest street action was exhibited at the international show „Protest &amp; Survive” put on by the famous London Whitechapel Gallery. Requested by the curators, he also re-staged his remarkable Geneva street action. The catalogue said this about his actions: „Tót's response to the censorship, isolation and suppression inherent in a totalitarian state was to produce his series of joy”. At the exhibition staged by the Vienna Kunstforum entitled „Superstars von Warhol bis Madonna” (2005) his conceptual paperwork „depicting” or rather just marking Mona Lisa’s (absent) smile was on view alongside Duchamps’ famous moustached Mona Lisa. 
The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had acquired several works of his created during his Budapest isolation and exhibited them in 2006 at its show „Eye on Europe – 1960 to Now”. Along with Czech artist Milan Knizak, Tót was the only exhibiting artist coming from Eastern Europe. Two years later MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry presented an Honorary Artist Membership to him.

==The 2010s – Tót in Collections==
In 2010 he exhibited with such wide-ranging institutions as Neues Museum Nürnberg, Museum für Moderne Kunst Wesenburg - Bremen, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, The V. Koc Foundation Contemporary Art Collection Istanbul. The Pompidou Centre’s catalogue published a copy of his 1975 letter to Pierre Restany ending with the words: „So I'm fucked with my zer0000000000000s”. Simultaneously, the Paris Hungarian Institute staged a show of the Iparterv Group of Artists (Le Progrés de l'Illusion), where Tót’s early (1966/67) informel paintings and paperworks were also on view.
His conceptual works were acquired from 1975 through 2010 by such major collections as those of MoMA New York, Getty Museum Los Angeles, Museum Ludwig Köln, Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, Israel Museum Jerusalem, Haags Gemeentemuseum The Hague, and the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts as well as East-Central European museums like National Gallery Prague, Museum Stuki Łódź, Museum of Modern Art Ljubjana, National Gallery of Art Varsaw, Museum of Modern Art Olmütz, Hungarian National Gallery, Ludwig Museum Budapest, or even two museums in Latin-America: the Center de Arte y Communication (CAYC) Buenos Aires, and the Museu de Arte Contemporaneu da Universidade de São Paulo. 
Probably more than a hundred of his major works are preserved in such notable private collections as Sammlung Dr. Speck (Cologne), Sammlung René Block (Berlin), Das Archive Sohm (Stuttgart), The Sacker Archive of Concrete und Visual Poetry (Miami Beach, Florida).
In 2009 he published a memoir entitled „I’m glad that I can write one sentence after another” with Noran Publishers, Budapest. A critic wrote this about the book: „This is half-way between a logbook and an autonomous work of art since the primacy of the text is questioned throughout by its unusual layout and illustrations… The account Tót gives of his youthful love-affair is deeply moving, the way he recalls the relationship of the regime towards its artists in the 60s and 70s, convincing, and the list of his fleeting affairs with girls is very funny.”
Due to the extreme multiplicity of Tót’s oeuvre, it is next to impossible to understand his art without a thorough-going theoretical back-up.

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental governance''' is a concept in [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]] that advocates [[sustainability]] ([[sustainable development]]) as the supreme consideration for [[Management|managing]] all human activities—[[Politics|political]], [[social]] and [[Economy|economic]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8. The Soft Path in a Nutshell. (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Governance includes government, business and civil society, and emphasizes whole [[Systems management|system management]]. To capture this diverse range of elements, environmental governance often employs alternative systems of governance, for example watershed-based management.&lt;ref&gt;IPlanet U, R. Michael M'Gonigle, Justine Starke&lt;/ref&gt;

It views [[natural resource]]s and the environment as global [[public goods]], belonging to the category of [[goods]] that are not diminished when they are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/analyse/fiche-analyse-317.html Launay, Claire, Mouriès, Thomas, '' Les différentes catégories de biens '', summary and excerpt from Pierre Calame’s book, ’’La démocratie en miettes’’, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that everyone benefits from for example, a breathable [[atmosphere]], stable [[climate]] and stable [[biodiversity]].

Public goods are non-rivalrous—a natural resource enjoyed by one person can still be enjoyed by others—and non-excludable—it is impossible to prevent someone consuming the good (breathing). Nevertheless, public goods are recognized as beneficial and therefore have value. The notion of a global public good thus emerges, with a slight distinction: it covers necessities that must not be destroyed by one person or state.

The non-rivalrous character of such goods calls for a management approach that restricts public and private actors from damaging them. One approach is to attribute an [[economic value]] to the resource. [[Water]] is possibly the best example of this type of good.

As of 2013 environmental governance is far from meeting these imperatives. “Despite a great awareness of environmental questions from [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], there is [[environmental degradation]] and the appearance of new environmental problems. This situation is caused by the parlous state of global environmental governance, wherein current global environmental governance is unable to address environmental issues due to many factors. These include fragmented governance within the [[United Nations]], lack of involvement from financial institutions, proliferation of environmental agreements often in conflict with [[trade]] measures; all these various problems disturb the proper functioning of global environmental governance. Moreover, divisions among northern countries and the persistent gap between developed and developing countries also have to be taken into account to comprehend the institutional failures of the current global environmental governance."

==Definitions==
'''What is Environmental Governance?'''

Environmental governance refers to the processes of [[decision-making]] involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the 'multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of “good governance”; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]]' (IUCN 2014)

Key principles of environmental governance include:

* Embedding the environment in all levels of decision-making and action
* Conceptualizing cities and communities, economic and political life as a subset of the environment
* Emphasizing the connection of people to the ecosystems in which they live
* Promoting the transition from open-loop/cradle-to-grave systems (like garbage disposal with no recycling) to closed-loop/[[cradle-to-cradle]] systems (like [[permaculture]] and [[zero waste]] strategies).

'''Neoliberal Environmental Governance''' – is an approach to the theory of environmental governance framed by a perspective on [[neoliberalism]] as an ideology, policy and practice in relation to the biophysical world. There are many definitions and applications of neoliberalism, e.g. in economic, international relations, etc. However, the traditional understanding of neoliberalism is often simplified to the notion of the primacy of market-led economics through the rolling back of the state, [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]]. Neoliberalism has evolved particularly over the last 40 years with many scholars leaving their ideological footprint on the neoliberal map. [[Hayek]] and [[Friedman]] believed in the superiority of the free market over state intervention. As long as the market was allowed to act freely, the supply/demand law would ensure the ‘optimal’ price and reward. In [[Karl Polanyi]]’s opposing view this would also create a state of tension in which self-regulating [[free market]]s disrupt and alter social interactions and “displace other valued means of living and working”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to the notion of an unregulated market economy there has also been a “paradoxical increase in [state] intervention”&lt;ref&gt;Jessop B. (2002) ‘Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Urban Governance: A State Theoretical Perspective’, Antipode, 34 (3), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; in the choice of economic, legislative and social policy reforms, which are pursued by the state to preserve the neoliberal order. This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in “purposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations".&lt;ref&gt;Peck, J. and Tickell, A. (2002) ‘Neoliberalising Space’, Antipode, 34(3): p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic ‘thing’ with a clear end point.&lt;ref&gt;Heynen N and Robins P. (2005) ‘The neoliberalisation of nature: Governance, privatization, enclosure and valuation’, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 16(1): p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally “connected neoliberalisation” processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that “cover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or “accumulation by dispossession” that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (2004) ‘Privatizing conditions of production: trade agreements as neoliberal environmental governance’, Geoforum, 35(3), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw, E. (2005) ‘Dispossessing H20: The contested terrain of water privatisation’, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 16(1): pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, B. (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’ Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94(3): pp. 565–584.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[water privatization|privatisation of water supply]] and [[sewage treatment]] in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to “deploy markets as the solution to environmental problems” in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.431&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a [[quantifiable]] resource ([[Robert Costanza|Costanza]], for example, estimates the earth [[ecosystem services|ecosystem's service]] value to be between 16 and [[orders of magnitude (currency)#1 trillion to 100 trillion|54 trillion dollars]] per year&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al., (1997) ‘The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital’, Nature 387(6630): pp. 255&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Environmental issues==

===Main drivers of environmental degradation===

''[[Economic growth]]'' – The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and [[environmental degradation]], arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a [[degrowth]] phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the [[quality of life]].

''[[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]]'' – The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or [[consumerist]] ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person.

''Destruction of [[biodiversity]]'' – The complexity of the planet’s ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is [[deforestation]]. Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]]. Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their [[environmental impact]].

''[[Population growth]]'' – Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women’s status.

"[[Pollution]]" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists.

"Agricultural practices" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and [[overgrazing]] lead to land degradation. The soil gets [[soil erosion|eroded]], and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in [[desertification]] of the land. Apart from [[land degradation]], [[water pollution]] is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can [[surface runoff|run-off]] into rivers and [[water contamination|contaminate the water]].

===Challenges===

The crisis by the impact of human activities on nature calls for governance. Which includes responses by international institutions, governments and citizens, who should meet this crisis by pooling the experience and knowledge of each of the agents and institutions concerned.

The [[environmental protection]] measures taken remain insufficient. The necessary reforms require time, energy, money and diplomatic negotiations. The situation has not generated a unanimous response. Persistent divisions slow progress towards global environmental governance.

The global nature of the crisis limits the effects of national or sectoral measures. Cooperation is necessary between actors and institutions in international trade, sustainable development and [[peace]].

Global, continental, national and local governments have employed a variety of approaches to environmental governance. Substantial positive and negative spillovers limit the ability of any single jurisdiction to resolve issues.

Challenges facing environmental governance include:

* Inadequate continental and global agreements
* Unresolved tensions between maximum development, sustainable development and maximum protection, limiting funding, damaging links with the economy and limiting application of [[Multilateral Environment Agreement]]s (MEAs).
* Environmental funding is not self-sustaining, diverting resources from problem-solving into funding battles.
* Lack of integration of sector policies
* Inadequate institutional capacities
* Ill-defined priorities
* Unclear objectives
* Lack of coordination within the UN, governments, the private sector and civil society
* Lack of shared vision
* Interdependencies among development/sustainable economic growth, trade, agriculture, health, peace and security.
* International imbalance between environmental governance and trade and finance programs, e.g., [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).
* Limited credit for organizations running projects within the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
* Linking [[UNEP]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[World Bank]] with MEAs
* Lack of government capacity to satisfy MEA obligations
* Absence of the gender perspective and equity in environmental governance
* Inability to influence public opinion&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf Global Conventions and Environmental Governance; Inforesources Focus No. 3, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;UNEP; International Environmental Governance and the Reform of the United Nations, XVI Meeting of the Forum of Environment Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean;  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/civil_society/PDF_docs/3rdGCSF_CS_Statement_IEG.pdf Civil Society Statement on International Environmental Governance; Seventh special session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF; Cartagena, Colombia; February 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Time lag between human action and environmental effect, sometimes as long as a generation&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underdal | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity and challenges of long term environmental governance | url = | journal = Global environmental change | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 386–393 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental problems being embedded in very complex systems, of which our understanding is still quite weak&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"/&gt;

All of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of [[multilateralism]] in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems.

On the other hand, The [[local Agenda 21|Agenda 21]] program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities.&lt;ref&gt;7,000 municipalities is very few, in view of the fact that over a million municipalities exist on the planet and that initial forecasts were for local agenda 21 actions being adopted in 500,000 municipalities in 1996 and throughout the rest of the planet in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action.

Bäckstrand and Saward wrote, “sustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.”&lt;ref name=Saward&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p58974_index.html Bäckstrand, Karin; Saward, Michel; Democratizing Global Governance: Stakeholder Democracy at the World Summit for Sustainable Development; Document presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association; Chicago; 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local governance===
A 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities.&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"&gt;Leach, M., Mearns, R and Scoones, I. (1997), Challenges to community based sustainable development, in IDS Bulletin Vol 28:4, pp 1&lt;/ref&gt; Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control”&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"/&gt; and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of innovation]] theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community-centered conservation interventions spread through space and time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Local level governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Pulgar Vidal observed a “new institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.”&lt;ref name=pv&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11304196171GAD-espanol.pdf Pulgar Vidal, Manuel; Gobernanza Ambiental Descentralizada (Decentralized Environmental Governance); 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes:

* formal and informal regulations, procedures and processes, such as consultations and participative democracy;
* social interaction that can arise from participation in development programs or from the reaction to perceived injustice;
* regulating social behaviours to reclassify an individual question as a [[public matter]];
* within-group [[participation (decision making)|participation]] in decision-making and relations with external actors.

He found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are:

* access to [[social capital]], including local knowledge, leaders and local shared vision;
* democratic access to information and decision-making;
* local government activity in environmental governance: as facilitator of access to natural resources, or as policy maker;
* an institutional framework that favours decentralized environmental governance and creates forums for social interaction and making widely accepted agreements acceptable.&lt;ref name=pv/&gt;

The legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population.&lt;ref name=poats&gt;[http://www.portalces.org/content/view/85/100000022/lang,Spanish Suárez, David; Poats, Susan V.; Procesos de Gobernanza Ambiental en el Manejo Participativo de Áreas Protegidas en Carchi (Environmental Governance Processes in the Participative Management of Carchi Protected Areas); Symposium; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo G., Saija G., Salomone R. 2013. From coastal management to environmental management: The sustainable eco-tourism program for the mid-western coast of Sardinia (Italy). Land Use Policy (31), 460-471&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governance===
States play a crucial role in environmental governance, because "however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments".&lt;ref&gt;Cable, V. 1999, ''Globalisation and global governance'', Chatham House Papers, London&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;WHAT 2000, "Governance for a sustainable future", Reports of the Commissions of the World Humanity Action Trust, viewed 22 April 2014, http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/governance/future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, [[environmental management]] has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the ''Grenelle de l’environnement''&lt;ref&gt;Operational Committee No. 24 "Institutions and stakeholder representativity" (introduced by Bertrand Pancher); Final report to the Prime Minister, senior Minister, Minister for the Ecology, Sustainable Development and Territorial Planning; 2008, also known as the Rapport Pancher.&lt;/ref&gt; process:

* included a variety of actors (e.g. the state, political leaders, unions, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and environmental protection foundations);
* allowed stakeholders to interact with the legislative and executive powers in office as indispensable advisors;
* worked to integrate other institutions, particularly the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council|Economic and Social Council]], to form a pressure group that participated in the process for creating an environmental governance model;
* attempted to link with environmental management at regional and local levels.

If environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauxglacees.com/Gouvernance-environnementale-vers Laime, Marc; Gouvernance environnementale: vers une meilleure concertation ? (Environmental Governance: towards better consultation?); 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

“In southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states’ political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/es/sobre/union/secretaria/oficinas/sudamerica/sur_trabajo/sur_pgam.cfm IUCN; Gobernanza ambiental para un desarrollo sostenible (Environmental Governance for Sustainable Development).]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies.

=== Global Governance ===
At the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and "a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt; The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and other international organisations such as UNEP ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]). Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;  This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global environmental governance is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. “It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt; State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains.&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"&gt;Newell, P.(2008). The political economy of global environmental governance.

==== Multi-tier governance ====

The literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of [[environmental issues]] have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadowcroft|first=James|title=Politics and scale: some implications for environmental governance|journal=Landscape and urban planning|year=2002|volume=61|issue=2–4|pages=169–179|doi=10.1016/s0169-2046(02)00111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: [[internationalisation]], increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafferty|first=William|title=Implementing Sustainable Development|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|author2=Meadowcroft, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales.

==== Institutional fit ====

[[Hans Bruyninckx]] claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruyninckx|first=Hans|title=Environmental evaluation practices and the issue of scale|journal=New directions for evaluation|year=2009|volume=122|pages=31–39|doi=10.1002/ev.293|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/234737/1/newdirectionsevaluation-HB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Oran|title=The globalization of socio-ecological systems: An agenda for scientific research|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=304–316|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the literature addresses the level of [[governance]] rather than ecological scale.

[[Elinor Ostrom]], amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=C|title=The problem of fit between ecosystems and institutions: ten years later|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2007|volume=12|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrem|first=Elinor|title=A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=39|pages=15181–15187|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702288104|bibcode=2007PNAS..10415181O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebel|first=L |author2=Garden, L |author3=Imamura, M|title=The Politics of Scale, Position and Place in the Governance of Water Resources in the Mekong Region|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of  [[river basins]].&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagg|first=V|author2=Gupta, J|title=Scale issues in the governance of water storage projects|journal=Water Resources Research|year=2008|volume=44|issue=10|pages=W10417|bibcode=2008WRR....4410417V|doi=10.1029/2007WR006364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance issues==

===Soil deterioration===

[[soil degradation|Soil]] and [[land degradation|land deterioration]] reduces its [[field capacity|capacity]] for capturing, [[water storage|storing]] and recycling water, energy and food. [[Alliance 21]] proposed solutions in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article514.html Alliance 21’s Proposal Paper “Save our Soils to Sustain our Societies”]&lt;/ref&gt;

* include [[Soil regeneration|soil rehabilitation]] as part of conventional and popular education
* involve all stakeholders, including policymakers and authorities, producers and land users, the scientific community and civil society to manage incentives and enforce regulations and laws
* establish a set of binding rules, such as an international convention
* set up mechanisms and incentives to facilitate transformations
* gather and share knowledge;
* mobilize funds nationally and internationally

===Climate change===
The scientific consensus on [[climate change]] is expressed in the reports of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Oreskes, N 2004, "Beyond the ivory tower", Science, vol. 306, no. 5702, pp, 1686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drivers of climate change can include
- Changes in [[solar irradiance]]
- Changes in atmospheric [[trace gas]] and [[aerosol]] concentrations
Evidence of climate change can be identified by examining
- Atmospheric concentrations of [[Green House Gas]]es (GHGs) such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2)
- Land and sea surface temperatures
- Atmospheric water vapor
- [[Precipitation]]
- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events
- [[Glacier]]s
- Rapid sea [[ice loss]]
- Sea level&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter01_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as [[fuel consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuels, [[deforestation]], increased [[agricultural production]] and production of [[xenobiotic]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, JC &amp; Elder, DL 1992 Climate, Sealevel rise and the coastal zone: management and planning of global changes, Ocean and coastal management, vol 18, pp- 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels. [[Kyoto protocol]] and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gateway/the-negotiations/the-un-climate-change-convention-and-the-kyoto-protocol&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], mainly {{CO2}}. Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon.

Two decades following the [[Brundtland Report]], however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted.

===Biodiversity===

Environmental governance for protecting the [[biodiversity]] has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, [[urban growth]], [[industrialization]] of countries, [[resource use|use of natural resources]], control of [[invasive species]],  the correct use of water and protection of [[air quality]]. Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have.

[[Population growth]] and [[urbanization]] have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes [[habitat loss]], which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and  [[habitat fragmentation]] affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed.&lt;ref&gt;Steffan-Dewenter &amp; Tscharntkae, 2000 ‘Butterfly community structure in fragmented habitats’  Ecology Letters, vol. 3, pp. 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

‘''Species are genetically unique and irreplaceable their loss is irreversible. Ecosystems vary across a vast range of parameters, and similar ecosystems (whether wetlands, forests, coastal reserves etc) cannot be presumed to be interchangeable, such that the loss of one can be compensated by protection or restoration of another''’.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2010 ‘Environmental Governance’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/environmental_law/elp_work/elp_work_issues/elp_work_governance&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid habitat loss, and consequently biodiversity loss, politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2007 ‘Guidelines for applying the precautionary principle to biodiversity conservation and  natural resource management’ viewed 28 May 2014, cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ln250507_ppguidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans.&lt;ref&gt;Sampford, C 2002 ‘Environmental governance for biodiversity’ Environmental Science &amp; Policy, vol. 5, pp. 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt; International agreements are good way to have it done right.

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD’s objectives are: “to conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.” The Convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is “a common concern for all humanity”. The       Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies.

The Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets, were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of ‘''halting and eventually reversing the loss of biodiversity of the planet''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"&gt;Convention on Biodiversity 2010 ‘Strategic Goals &amp; Targets for 2020’ viewed 28  May 2014, www.cbd.int/2011-2020/goals/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to ‘''promote its overall vision of living in harmony with nature''’ As result (...) ‘''mainstream biodiversity at different levels. Throughout the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity, governments are encouraged to develop, implement and communicate the results of national strategies for implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; According to the CBD &lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; the five Aichi targets are:
#‘''Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society'';
#''Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use'';
#''Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and [[genetic diversity]]'';
#''Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]]'';
#''Enhance implementation through [[participatory planning]], [[knowledge management]] and [[capacity building]]''.’

=== Water ===

The 2003 [[UN World Water Development Report]] claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%.{{update|date=September 2013}}
In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2003). ''World Water Development Report 1: "Water for People, Water for Life"''. Retrieved from: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129726e.pdf#page=27&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the UK’s [[WaterAid]] charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases.

According to Alliance 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article501.html Proposals Related to the Water Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; “All levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of [[irrigation]] and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.”

[[Australia]]n [[water resources]] have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in [[groundwater]] use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia’s inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of water trading systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated.  More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in [[Macquarie Marshes]] has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing [[daughterless carp]] to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands.  Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control.  The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===

On 16 September 1987 the United Nations General Assembly signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] to address the declining [[ozone layer]]. Since that time, the use of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (industrial refrigerants and aerosols) and farming fungicides such as [[methyl bromide]] has mostly been eliminated, although other damaging gases are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gareau, Brian J. From Precaution to Profit: Contemporary Challenges to Global Environmental Protection in the Montreal Protocol (2013, Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear risk===

The [[Nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] is the primary multilateral agreement governing nuclear activity.

===Transgenic organisms===
[[Genetically modified organisms]] are not the subject of any major multilateral agreements. They are the subject of various restrictions at other levels of governance. GMOs are in widespread use in the US, but are heavily restricted in many other jurisdictions.

Controversies have ensued over [[golden rice]], [[AquAdvantage salmon|genetically modified salmon]], [[Monsanto#Seeds|genetically modified seeds]], disclosure and other topics.

=== Precautionary principle ===

The [[precautionary principle]] or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.
The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, BD 2000, 'Applying the precautionary principle to the environment', Bulletin Of The World Health Organization, 78, 9, p. 1159, Health Business Elite, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;European Report 25 Jan. 2013"ENVIRONMENT : PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE: EEA REPORT DAMNING TO INDUSTRY."Academic OneFile. Web. 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-environmental conflicts ===
Leading experts have emphasized on the importance of taking into account the security aspects the environment and natural resources will cause. The twenty-first century is looking into a future with an increase in mass migrations of refugees, wars and praetorian regimes caused by the effect of environmental degradation such as water scarcity, deforestation and soil erosion, air pollution and, climate change effects such as rising sea levels. For a long time, foreign-policy challenges have focused on social causes as being the only reason for social and political changes. However, it is a crucial moment to understand and take into consideration the security implications that environmental stress will bring to the current political and social structure around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|date=February 1994|title=The Coming Anarchy: How scarcity, crime, overpopulation,tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet.|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=GLOBAL|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==

===Conventions===

The main multilateral conventions, also known as Rio Conventions, are as follows:

[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1992–1993): aims to conserve biodiversity. Related agreements include the [http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cartagena-protocol-en.pdf Cartagena Protocol] on biosafety.

[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCC) (1992–1994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|stabilize the climate system]] without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) (1994–1996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa).

Further conventions:
* [http://www.ramsar.org Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance] (1971–1975)
* [http://whc.unesco.org UNESCO World Heritage Convention]  (1972–1975)
* [http://www.cites.org Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES)] (1973–1975)
* [http://www.cms.int Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species] (1979–1983)
* [http://www.unece.org/env/water Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention)] (1992–1996)
* [http://www.basel.int Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal] (1989–1992)
* [http://www.pic.int Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade]
* [http://www.pops.int Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (COP)] (2001–2004)

The Rio Conventions are characterized by:

* obligatory execution by signatory states
* involvement in a sector of global environmental governance
* focus on the fighting poverty and the development of sustainable living conditions;
* funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for countries with few financial resources;
* inclusion of a for assessing ecosystem status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumassessment.org/fr/index.aspx Millennium assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental conventions are regularly criticized for their:

* rigidity and verticality: they are too descriptive, homogenous and top down, not reflecting the diversity and complexity of environmental issues. Signatory countries struggle to translate objectives into concrete form and incorporate them consistently;
* duplicate structures and aid: the sector-specific format of the conventions produced duplicate structures and procedures. Inadequate cooperation between government ministries;
* contradictions and incompatibility: e.g., “if reforestation projects to reduce {{CO2}} give preference to monocultures of exotic species, this can have a negative impact on biodiversity (whereas natural regeneration can strengthen both biodiversity and the conditions needed for life).”&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"/&gt;

Until now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the [[Commission for Sustainable Development]], but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}

===Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)===

MEAs are agreements between several countries that apply internationally or regionally and concern a variety of environmental questions. As of 2013 over 500 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), including 45 of global scope involve at least 72 signatory countries.&lt;ref name=inomata&gt;Inomata, Tadanori; Management Review of Environmental Governance within the United Nations System; United Nations; Joint Inspection Unit; Geneva; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Multilateral Environmental Agreement Negotiator’s Handbook: Pacific Region 2013|date=2013|publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme / New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law, University of Auckland|location=Samoa / New Zealand|isbn=978-982-04-0475-5|url=http://www.sprep.org/attachments/Publications/EMG/MEA_Handbook_2013.pdf|author2=Stroud, Lucy |author3=Peteru, Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as [[deforestation in Borneo]] or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states.

Many Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"&gt;Steiner, A &amp; Oviir, M (2010) ‘Auditing the Implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs): A Primer for Auditors’, United Nations Environment Programme, pp. 1-136&lt;/ref&gt; Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt; These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Union, (2010) ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’, African Union, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://www.au.int/en/content/bamako-convention-ban-import-africa-and-control-transboundary-movement-and-management-hazard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil Action Network (2011) ‘The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal’, Basil Action Network, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://ban.org/about_basel_conv/treaty_text.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

“The environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#International_institutions UNEP], MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level.

"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases:

* a) assessment of environment status;
* b) international policy development;
* c) formulation of MEAs;
* d) policy implementation;
* e) policy assessment;
* f) enforcement;
* g) sustainable development.

"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three
phases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.”&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

Lack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them.&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

==Background==

The risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the [[Stockholm Conference]] (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the [[Law of treaties|Law of Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Mento, Josep; The Global Environment and International law, University of Texas Press; 2003; p 7..&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs.

The [[Brundtland Report]], published in 1987 by the [[Earth Summit|UN Commission on Environment and Development]], stipulated the need for economic development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs.

===Rio Conference (1992) and reactions===

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], was the first major international meeting since the end of the [[Cold War]] and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of [[secretariats]].

Governments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.&lt;ref name=boug&gt;Bouguerra, Larbi; La consommation assassine.

Ideas for responsible consumption) ; Éditions Charles Léopold Mayer; 2005; adaptation of State of the World. Special Focus - The Consumer Society; The Worldwatch Institute; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agenda 21===

[[Agenda 21]] is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory-based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies.

The Agenda has been accused of using [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled “International Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies” states, “The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.”

The UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries.

In 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

According to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP:

* initiate a strategic independent overhaul of its mission;
* consolidate the financial information and transparency process;
* restructure organizing governance by creating an operative executive council that balances the omnipresence of the overly imposing and fairly ineffectual Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF).

Other proposals offer a new mandate to “produce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and [http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Des-responsabilites-communes-mais.html common but differentiated responsibilities] should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.”&lt;ref&gt;Reforming International Environmental Governance: Statement representing views expressed at two meetings of stakeholders held at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP:

* obtain a social consensus on a long-term vision;
* analyze the current situation and future scenarios;
* produce a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of sustainable development;
* build on existing strategies and processes;
* multiply links between national and local strategies;
* include all these points in the financial and budget plan;
* adopt fast controls to improve process piloting and identification of progress made;
* implement effective participation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/Statement%20on%20IEG%20by%20civil%20society.pdf Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, et al (comp.); Options for Strengthening the Environment Pillar of Sustainable Development. Compilation of Civil Society Proposals on the Institutional Framework for the United Nations' Environmental Activities; 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group stated, “Consider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/ieg/SubmissionsToThePanel/BRAZILIANFORUMOFNGOS.pdf Submission by the Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and the Development to the Panel Consultation with Civil Society; June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Environment Facility (GEF)====
{{main|Global Environment Facility}}
Created in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.

GEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million.&lt;ref name=young2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoë |first=Young |title=A new green order: The World Bank and the politics of the global environmental facility |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Andler, Lydia; The Secretariat of the Global Environment Facility: From Network to Bureaucracy; "Global Governance Working Paper", no. 24; Amsterdam et al.; The Global Governance Project; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others.&lt;ref&gt;Werksman, Jake; Consolidating global environmental governance: New lessons from the GEF?; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global "green market". It represents “an adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.”{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}  Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment.

GEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Conventions conventions]. It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002.{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}

====United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)====
{{main|Commission on Sustainable Development}}
This intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006-2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wri.org/pubs/pubs_pdf.cfm?PubID=3764 World Resources Institute; World Resources 2002–2004: Decisions for the Earth: Balance, Voice and Power; Washington DC; 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.&lt;ref name=Najam&gt;[http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/geg.pdf Najam, A., Papa, M. and Taiyab, N. Global Environmental Governance. A Reform Agenda; IISD; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Environment Organization (WEO)====
{{main|United Nations Environment Organization}}
A proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the [[World Health Organization]] could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Proposals proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/Gouvernance-internationale-de-l'environnement-les-prochaines-etapes Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B.; Gouvernance internationale de l'environnement: les prochaines étapes (International Environmental Governance; the next stages)]; in "Synthèse", 2005, no. 01, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI).&lt;/ref&gt; WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====World Bank====
{{main|World Bank}}
The World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank’s mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Marschinski, Robert; Behrle, Steffen; The World Bank: Making the Business Case for the Environment; "Global Governance Working Paper No 21"; Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP’s standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance. Other financial institutions, regional development banks and the private sector also drew up their own standards. Criticism is not directed at the World Bank’s standards in themselves, which Najam considered as “robust”,&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; but at their legitimacy and efficacy.

===== GEF =====

The [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]'s account of itself as of 2012 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef] is as "the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment", period, which "provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants."  It claims to have provided "$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million."  It serves as mechanism for the:
*[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD)
*[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)
*[[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs)
*[[Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD)
*implementation of [[Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in some countries with "economies in transition" [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef]
This mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/instrument].

====World Trade Organization (WTO)====
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO’s mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO’s own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO’s trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country’s ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO’s trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences.

Some criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad.  In a recently dispute over labelling of [[dolphin safe label]]s for [[tuna]] between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed,

====International Monetary Fund (IMF)====
{{main|International Monetary Fund}}
The IMF’s mission is "''to ensure the stability of the international monetary system''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm/|title=IMF -- About|website=www.imf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues."&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

==== UN ICLEI ====

{{main|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives}}

The UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-making&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclei.org/ ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; is named the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Its slogan is "Local Governments for Sustainability".
This body sponsored the concept of [[full cost accounting]] that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance.

ICLEIs projects and achievements include:
*Convincing thousands of municipal leaders to sign the [[World Mayors and Municipal Leaders Declaration on Climate Change]] (2005) which notably requests of other levels of government that:
:Global trade regimes, credits and banking reserve rules be reformed to advance debt relief and incentives to implement policies and practices that reduce and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ICLEI promotes [[best practice exchange]] among municipal governments globally, especially [[green infrastructure]], [[sustainable procurement]].

====Other secretariats====
Other international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including:

* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), promoting development;
* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) which works on the climate and atmosphere;
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  (FAO) working on the protection of agriculture, forests and fishing;
* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) which focuses on nuclear security.

Over 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam.&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them.

====Criticism====

According to Bauer, Busch and Siebenhüner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glogov.org Bauer, Steffen; Busch, Per-Olof; Siebenhüner, Bernd; Administering International Governance: What Role for Treaty Secretariats? "Global Governance Working Paper" No 29. Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered.

The United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements.

===States===

====Environmental governance at the state level====

Environmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions.
See also the [[Environmental policy of the European Union]].

====State participation in global environmental governance====

US refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan.

The World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries.

===Business===

Environmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains:

*  values (vision, mission, principles);
*  policy (strategy, objectives, targets);
*  oversight (responsibility, direction, training, communication);
*  process (management systems, initiatives, internal control, monitoring and review, stakeholder dialogue, transparency, environmental accounting, reporting and verification);
*  performance (performance indicators, benchmarking, eco-efficiency, reputation, compliance, liabilities, business development).&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0904BKFE-e-e.pdf White, Andrew; Klernan, Matthew; Corporate Environment Governance. A Study into the Influence of Environmental Governance and the Financial Performance; Environment Agency (United Kingdom Government); 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

White and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Business environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Environmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/governance.html |title=Environmental Governance |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance is the set of [[Business process|processes]], customs, [[policies]], laws, and institutions affecting the way a [[corporation]] (or [[company]]) is managed. Corporate [[governance]] is affected by the relationships among [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. These stakeholders research and quantify performance to compare and contrast the environmental performance of thousands of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/stakeholders.html |title=Priority Stakeholders |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large corporations with global supply chains evaluate the environmental performance of business partners and suppliers for marketing and ethical reasons. Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies.

===Non-governmental organizations===
{{Main|Non-governmental organizations}}
According to Bäckstrand and Saward,&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; “broader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.”

Local activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company’s plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bebbington, Anthony; et al.; Los movimientos sociales frente a la minería: disputando el desarrollo territorial andino (Social Movements and Mining: disputes over territorial development in the Andes); in J. Bengoa (ed.) "Movimientos sociales y desarrollo territorial rural en América Latina" (Social Movements and Territorial Rural Development in Latin America). Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher, Dana R.; Civil Society Protest and Participation: Civic Engagement Within the Multilateral Governance Regime pp. 176-201; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/hawaii/howwework/community-based-marine-conservation.xml |title=Community-Based Marine Conservation &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flacso.org.ec/docs/WP_005_AndradeM_01_2.pdf Andrade Mendoza, Karen; La gobernanza ambiental en el Ecuador: El conflicto alrededor de la licencia Ambiental en el bloque 31, en el parque nacional Yasuní (Environmental Governance in Ecuador:  the conflict concerning the environmental license for block 31 in the Yasuní National Park); FLACSO; Observatorio Socioambiental; Quito; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bengoa,&lt;ref&gt;Bengoa, José; et al. Movimientos sociales, gobernanza ambiental y desarrollo territorial (Social Movements, Environmental Governance and Territorial Development) ; Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; “social movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.” But despite successes in this area, “these institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.” He cites several reasons:

* conflict between in-group cohesion and openness to outside influence;
* limited trust between individuals;
* contradiction between social participation and innovation;
* criticisms without credible alternatives to environmentally damaging activities

A successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest.&lt;ref name=poats/&gt;

==Proposals==

The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are:&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt;

* expert leadership;
* positioning science as the authoritative basis of sound environmental policy;
* coherence and reasonable coordination;
* well-managed institutions;
* incorporate environmental concerns and actions within other areas of international policy and action

=== Coherence and coordination ===

Despite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth’s ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"&gt;{{cite web

| access-date=30 March 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Rorden | title = Global governance : critical perspectives | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780203302804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inforesources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf ''Global Conventions and Environmental Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are:

* parallel structures and competition, without a coherent strategy
* contradictions and incompatibilities, without appropriate compromise
* competition between multiple agreements with incompatible objectives, regulations and processes
* integrating policy from macro- to micro- scales.

Recommended measures:

* MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ UN Millenium Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; and conventions, combining sustainability and reduction of poverty and equity;
* country-level approach linking global and local scales
* coordination and division of tasks in a multilateral approach that supports developing countries and improves coordination between donor countries and institutions
* use of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.aspx Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; in development planning
* transform conflicts into tradeoffs, synergies and win-win options

Contemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"/&gt;

Some analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently.

=== Democratization ===

Starting in 2002, Saward&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; and others began to view the [[Earth Summit]] process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by:

* the importance given to scientific and technical considerations
* the official and unofficial participation of many actors with heterogeneous activity scopes
* growing uncertainty
* a new interpretation of [[international law]] and social organization models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behnassi | first1 = Mohamed |title= Les négociations environnementales multilatérales: Vers une gouvernance environnementale mondiale (Multilateral Environmental Negotiations: towards world environmental governance) |journal= C Durable: Doctoral thesis summary paper|date= 2003|url=http://cdurable.info/Les-Negociations-Environnementales-Multinationales-NEM-vers-une-Gouvernance-Environnementale-Mondiale-GEM,1136.html|location=Casablanca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johal | first1 = Surjinder | last2 = Ulph | first2 = Alistair | title = Globalization, lobbying, and international environmental governance | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–403 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | date = August 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments.

===Institutional reform===

Actors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN/UNPAN021755.pdf Resolution 60/1 of the United Nations General Assembly.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes “the need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.”

Proposals include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/resolution230708.pdf UN environmental governance report]&lt;/ref&gt;

* greater and better coordination between agencies;
* strengthen and acknowledge UNEP’s scientific role;
* identify MEA areas to strengthen coordination, cooperation and teamwork between different agreements;
* increase regional presence;
* implement the [[Bali Strategic Plan]] on improving technology training and support for the application of environmental measures in poor countries;
* demand that UNEP and MEAs participate formally in all relevant WTO committees as observers.
* strengthen its financial situation;
* improve secretariats’ efficiency and effectiveness.

One of the main studies addressing this issue proposes:

* clearly divide tasks between development organizations, UNEP and the MEAs
* adopt a political direction{{clarify|date=September 2013}} for environmental protection and sustainable development
* authorize the UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum to adopt the UNEP medium-term strategy
* allow Member States to formulate and administer MEAs an independent secretariat for each convention
* support UNEP in periodically assessing MEAs and ensure coordination and coherence
* establish directives for setting up national/regional platforms capable of incorporating MEAs in the Common Country Assessment (CCA) process and [[United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)]]&lt;ref&gt;The CCA is the main diagnostic tool available for teams working in UN countries and their partners. It is used to assess and create a shared understanding of the underlying challenges facing a country during its development. The UNDAF is a product of the CCA analysis and collaboration process and provides the basis for UN cooperation programmes. (Source: ISDR; Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo Framework; United Nations; 2007; chapter 4; p. 81-120).&lt;/ref&gt;
* establish a global joint planning framework
* study the aptitude and efficiency of environmental activities’ funding, focusing on differential costs
* examine and redefine the concept of funding differential costs as applicable to existing financial mechanisms
* reconsider remits, division of tasks and responsibilities between entities that provide services to the multipartite conferences. Clearly define the services that UN offices provide to MEA secretariats
* propose measures aiming to improve personnel provision and geographic distribution for MEA secretariats
* improve transparency resource use for supporting programmes and in providing services to MEAs. Draw up a joint budget for services supplied to MEAs.

===Education===

A 2001 Alliance 21 report proposes six fields of action:&lt;ref&gt;Ziaka, Yolanda; Robicon, Philippe; Souchon, Christian; Environmental Education: Six Proposals for Citizens’ Action. Proposal Paper, [http://www.alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World]; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthen citizens' critical faculties to ensure greater democratic control of political orientations
* develop a global and critical approach
* develop civic education training for teachers
* develop training for certain socio-professional groups
* develop environmental education for the entire population;
* assess the resulting experiences of civil society

===Transform daily life===

Individuals can modify consumption, based on [[voluntary simplicity]]: changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population’s basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend.

Alternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems.

Alternative energy sources are becoming less costly.

Ecological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another.

Governments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

The [[Community Environmental governance Global Alliance]] encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge. [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]] capped population growth based on the carrying capacity of the Sheep River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/default.aspx?cid=208&amp;lang=1 |title=Okotoks - 1. Water Management |publisher=Okotoks.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fraser Basin Council Watershed Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraserbasin.bc.ca/ |title=Fraser Basin Council - Home |publisher=Fraserbasin.bc.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in British Columbia, Canada, manages issues that span municipal jurisdictions. [[Smart Growth]] is an international movement that employs key tenets of Environmental governance in [[urban planning]].

===Policies and regulations===

Establish policies and regulations that promote “infrastructures for well being” whilst addressing the political, physical and cultural levels.

Eliminate subsidies that have a negative environmental impact and tax pollution

Promoting workers’ personal and family development.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

===Coordination===

A programme of national workshops on synergies between the three Rio Conventions launched in late 2000, in collaboration with the relevant secretariats. The goal was to strengthen coordination at the local level by:

* sharing information
* promoting political dialogue to obtain financial support and implement programmes
* enabling the secretariats to update their joint work programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommetjohannesburg.org/initiatives/gouvernance-environnementale.html Diallo, Hama Arba; La gouvernance environnementale et la synergie entre les trois conventions globales (Environmental Governance and the Synergy between the Three Global Conventions); Johannesburg Summit document; 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Laura B.; The Effectiveness of WTO and WIPO: Lessons for Environmental Governance? in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; “In the context of globalization, the question of linking up environmental themes with other subjects, such as trade, investment and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the economic incentives to participate in and apply agreements would seem to provide an important lesson for the effective development of environmental governance structures.” Environmental concerns would become part of the global economic system. “These problems also contain the seeds of a new generation of international conflicts that could affect both the stability of international relations and collective security. Which is why the concept of ‘collective security’ has arisen.”

Moving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system. Kanie&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichika; Global Environmental Governance in Terms of Vertical Linkages;  pp. 86-113 {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that NGOs, scientists, international institutions and stakeholder partnerships can reduce the distance that separates the local and international levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">A '''figurative [[analogy]]''' is a [[wikt:comparison|comparison]] about two things that are not alike but share only some common property.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morris.umn.edu/~burkebr/spch1100/Ch_08_notes.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, a literal analogy is about two things that are nearly exactly alike.

The two things compared in a figurative analogy are not obviously comparable in most respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n72m240n34123784/ | doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9165-0_10 | title=Comparing the Incomparable: Figurative Analogies in a Dialectical Testing Procedure | year=2009 | journal=Argumentation Library | pages=133–140 | last1 = Garssen | first1 = Bart}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metaphor]]s and [[simile]]s are two types of figurative analogies.

In the course of analogical reasoning, figurative analogies become weak if the [[disanalogies]] of the entities being compared are relevant—in the same way that literal analogies become weak.  Consider the disanalogies involving two cars in a literal analogy (the same principle concerning disanalogies is true for a figurative analogy):  The day they were purchased isn't relevant whereas the previous accidents of the two cars would be relevant.  If car A has been in five accidents while car B has been in no accidents, then the conclusion drawn about the future performance of the two cars is affected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">The '''Folkewall'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml Folkewall]&lt;/ref&gt; is a construction with the dual functions of growing plants and purifying waste water.  It was designed by Folke Günther&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/cv/Eng/Biography/short.shtml Folke Günther]&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden. 

Inspired by the "Sanitas wall" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in [[Botswana]], this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and [[Water purification|purification]] of [[greywater]]. This system is also known as a living wall or [[green wall]].

==Design==
The basic design is a wall of hollow concrete slabs, with compartments opening on one or both sides of the wall. The hollows are filled with inert material like [[gravel]], [[expanded clay aggregate]], [[perlite]], or [[vermiculite]]. It is designed to let the water [[Trickling filter|trickle]] over the longest possible treatment path along the length of the wall among the pebbles. 

The water is brought in at the top, and percolates following a zig-zag pattern inside the wall. As it does so the plant roots grow among the inert material and extract nutrients from the water. A film of [[Bioremediation|beneficial bacteria]] grows over the pebbles, releasing the nutrients in the percolating greywater. At the bottom of the wall a container collects the purified water, which can then be used for non-[[potable]] household use, for watering the garden, or it can be returned to the top of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/features/digital/archives/0702dignews-1.asp Living wall systems ''(subscription required)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
''Plants used'': since the harvesting of the plants is a part of the purification process, fast growing, herbaceous crops are particularly suited for the Folkewall. Annual food crops are suitable, perennials like trees and shrubs should be avoided.

''Greywater'': The water feeding the plants in the wall must be free of [[heavy metals]] and/or unsafe [[pollutants]], notably [[human waste]]. This requires using source-separating toilets.

==Advantages==
* '''Better use of greywater''': most of the evaporation happens through the plant's leaves, which makes the method especially useful in arid climates. The Folkewall makes use of this aspect.
* '''More efficient use of the area'''. For example in greenhouses or other glazed areas where a wall is used as a greywater purification device, it also works as a '''heat exchanger and buffer'''.
* '''Purification''' of the percolating water, so greywater can be used as irrigation water.
* In warm climates, the wall can be used on the sunny side to '''cool the building'''. 
* '''Low-cost housing''': the combined use of Folkewalls and source-separating toilets would "reduce the infrastructure cost by about 30%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/JF_OTHER/SMALL/Growing%20wall%20-%20Water.pdf Growing walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Formosan black bear''' (臺灣黑熊, ''Ursus thibetanus formosanus''), also known as the '''white-throated bear''', is a [[subspecies]] of the [[Asiatic black bear]]. Formosan black bears are [[endemic]] to [[Taiwan]]. In 2001, they were voted the [[List of national animals|most representative wildlife of Taiwan]] in a half-year-long countrywide voting campaign. They are also the largest land animals and the only native bears (''[[Ursidae]]'') in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="gio_gov_tw"&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/ecology/English/animals_e/MidAnimals_e/MidAnimals06_e.htm Taiwan's Ecological Conservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013130/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/ecology/English/animals_e/MidAnimals_e/MidAnimals06_e.htm |date=2008-09-08 }}. Gio.gov.tw. Retrieved on 2011-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of severe exploitation and habitat degradation in recent decades, populations of wild Formosan black bears have been declining. This species was listed as "endangered" under Taiwan's Wildlife Conservation Act ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 野生動物保育法) in 1989. Their geographic distribution is restricted to remote, rugged areas at elevations of {{convert|1000|-|3500|m}}.

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:V character.JPG|thumb|130px|left|The V-shaped white mark on a bear's chest]]
[[File:Formosan Black Bear01.jpg|thumb|160px|right|A Formosan black bear]]
The Formosan black bear is sturdily built and has a round head, short neck, small eyes, and long [[snout]]. Its head measures 26–35&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 40–60&amp;nbsp;cm in [[circumference]]. Its ears are 8–12&amp;nbsp;cm long. Its snout resembles a dog's, hence its nickname is "dog bear". Its tail is inconspicuous and short — usually less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm long. Its body is well covered with rough, glossy, black hair, which can grow over 10&amp;nbsp;cm long around the neck. The tip of its chin is white. On the chest, there is a distinctive yellowish or white mark that is shaped like a "V" character or a [[crescent]] moon. This earns it another nickname — "moon bear".&lt;ref name="physical_chars"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/bear/features.asp] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
[[File:Acorn-20.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Acorns]]
[[File:19-Formosan Black Bear.JPG|thumb|160px|A bear eating fruits]]

They feed primarily on leaves, buds, fruits, roots, although they also eat insects, small animals, and [[carrion]]. Diets of bears monitored in [[Yushan National Park]] include succulent vegetation in spring, soft fruits rich in [[carbohydrate]] in summer, and fat-loaded [[Mast (botany)|hard mast]] (e.g., [[acorn]] and [[walnut]]) in fall/winter.

== Habitat and behavior ==
The Formosan bear lives in the mountainous forests in the eastern two-thirds of Taiwan at elevations of {{convert|1,000|to|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the winter, rather than [[hibernate|hibernating]] like [[Asiatic black bear]]s in [[temperate]] areas, they move to lower elevations to find food. They are active for 54–57% of daylight hours, and more active during summer (60%) and fall/winter (60%) than spring (47%). They are primarily active during the day in the spring and summer; and increasingly active at night in the fall/winter when [[acorn]]s are abundant. They are solitary and usually move around extensively except during the mating season or when caring for cubs. Formosan bears are also the only bears on the planet that make temporary nests.

Although they look clumsy and slow, Formosan black bears can easily outrun humans, reaching speeds of 30–40&amp;nbsp;km per hour. They are skilled at swimming and climbing, as well. Because of their [[endangered species]] status and their habit of avoiding humans, Formosan black bears are rarely seen in the wild. In most encounters the bear retreats and runs away from humans. Even though bears can be aggressive, they rarely attack humans without provocation.

==Reproduction==

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:26-sucking_cubs.jpg|A mother bear nursing her cubs
Image:44 days Feb 12.jpg|A 44-days old cub
Image:12-cub_on_tree.jpg|A bear cub climbing in a tree
&lt;/gallery&gt;
As solitary animals, Formosan black bears do not stay in fixed shelters, except for females during their breeding period. The bear's courtship period is very brief. A male trails after a female for a few days. After mating, they return to their solitary lives. Females reach [[sexual maturity]] at age 3–4 and males reach sexual maturity at age 4–5, usually one year later than females. Mating is usually from June to August and [[pregnancy]] lasts for 6–7 months. Thus, wild females usually give birth between December and the following February.&lt;ref name="reproduction"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/bear/breeding.asp] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each birth produces 1–3 cubs. Cubs will be nursed by mother for about six months. When they are strong enough to leave the den, bear cubs will remain with the mother for approximately two years, until the mother enters the next cycle of [[estrus]] and drives the cubs off. This forms the 2-year reproductive cycle of Formosan black bears.&lt;ref name="reproduction"/&gt;

==Hunter and hunted==

Formosan black bears (台灣黑熊) and [[Formosan clouded leopard]]s  (台灣雲豹) — two of the most powerful land animals on the island of [[Taiwan]] — used to roam over the ranges and mountains of [[Taiwan]]. However, while the leopard is now extinct, the bear, though endangered, has survived.&lt;ref name="hunter_and_hunted"&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/relation/hunterandbear.asp]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research by the Institute of Wildlife Conservation, [[National Pingtung University of Science and Technology]], this may be due to the myths and traditional taboos of [[Taiwanese aborigines]].&lt;ref name="wildlife_conservation"&gt;[http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/techwp.aspx?id=0980115003&amp;ctunit=208&amp;ctnode=287&amp;mp=7 行政院國家科學委員會, National Science Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211192306/http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/techwp.aspx?id=0980115003&amp;ctunit=208&amp;ctnode=287&amp;mp=7 |date=2009-02-11 }}. Web1.nsc.gov.tw. Retrieved on 2011-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bunun people]] call black bears ''Aguman'' or ''Duman'' which means the devil. If a Bunun hunter's trap accidentally traps a bear, he has to build a cottage in the mountains and burn the body of the bear there. He also has to stay in the cottage alone away from the village until the millet harvest is finished. [[Rukai people|Rukai]] and [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] people are allowed to hunt bears, but the hunters have to pay the price of carrying the ancient curse in return. [[Rukai people|Rukai]] people believe hunting bears can result in disease. Also, not every one is allowed to eat bear meat, and children are strictly forbidden to do so. In Taroko ([[Truku people|Truku]]) legend, Formosan black bears are respectful “kings of the forest” whose white marks on their chests represent the moon. The Taroko people believe that killing black bears results in family disaster. In general, among these hunting tribes, hunters of boars are respected as heroes, while hunters of bears are considered losers.&lt;ref name="hunter_and_hunted"/&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:YLS 8822.jpg|thumb|[[Mascot]] of the [[2017 Summer Universiade]] held in [[Taipei]], [[TAIWAN]]]]
From 1998 to 2000, 15 Formosan black bears were captured and radio collared in [[Yushan National Park]]. Reported bear sightings are very infrequent and no one knows exactly how many bears still exist. The species has been legally protected since 1989 but illegal hunting continues and such poaching continues to threaten Formosan black bear populations. For example, eight of fifteen bears captured in the above survey had missing toes or paws, caused by illegal traps.

Since 1989, Formosan black bears have been listed as [[endangered animals]] and protected by Taiwan's ''Cultural Heritage Preservation Law'' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 文化資產保存法). Internationally, this species is listed on [http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml Appendix I] of [[CITES]]. CITES bans all international trade of any products from this species. The Formosan black bear is also on the [[Red List of Threatened Animals|red list]] of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] ([[IUCN]]) which declares that these bears are vulnerable to extinction.

An indigenous [[Bunun people|Bunun]] hunter once said, "If there were no bears in the mountains, the forest would look empty and I would feel lonely." Mei-Hsiu Hwang of Institute of Wildlife Conservation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/index.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109124505/http://tve.npust.edu.tw:8080/project/meibear/English/index.asp |date=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a campaigner for black-bear preservation, also said: "We do not wish to lose this soul of Taiwan's mountains. We do not wish our offspring to see them only in the zoo or in history books."

There is still hope for the Formosan black bear. In 2009, Lin Yuan-Yuan (a member of Yushan National Park's black bear conservation group) recorded footage showing a mother bear attempting to help her two cubs cross a rapid near Batongguan Historic Trail (八通關古道) in the eastern section of Tafen (塔芬).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016211640/http://english.ysnp.gov.tw/Publication.aspx?CurrentNodeID=1802&amp;Level=3&amp;PublicID=569 Yushan National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, '''frustration''' is a common [[emotional]] response to opposition, related to [[anger]], [[annoyance]] and [[disappointment]], frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or goal&lt;ref name="The Consolations of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Botton|first1=Alain|title=The Consolations of Philosophy|date=April 2011|publisher=Vintage Books, a division of Random House Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77917-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. There are two types of frustration; internal and external. Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling [[Personality psychology|personal]] [[objective (goal)|goals]], [[Desire (philosophy)|desires]], instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived [[:wikt:deficiency|deficiencies]], such as a lack of [[confidence]] or [[fear]] of social situations. [[Emotional conflict|Conflict]], such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create [[cognitive dissonance]]. External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time.&lt;ref name="Frustration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frustration|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/pyschologist_frustration.htm|website=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple ways individuals [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with frustration such as [[passive–aggressive behavior]], [[anger]], or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeronimus | displayauthors=etal|title= Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences |chapter=Frustration|date=Jan 2018|publisher=Springer |location=New York|editors= Zeigler-Hill, V., Shackelford, T.K. |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_815-1|page=1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The [[Frustration aggression theory|frustration–aggression hypothesis]] | last = Miller | first = NE | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 48 | issue = 4 |date=July 1941 | pages = 337–42 | doi=10.1037/h0055861}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Frustration originates from feelings of uncertainty and insecurity which stems from a sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Overcome Frustration|url=http://www.eruptingmind.com/how-to-overcome-frustration/|website=Erupting Mind|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. External blocking happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.

Some people are predisposed towards feelings of frustration, indexed in terms of [[temperament]] (frustration), in adolescence and [[neuroticism]] in adulthood.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"/&gt; Temperamental frustration is associated with perceptual alterations including changes in perceived relationship affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laceulle, O.M. | displayauthors=etal| year = 2015 | title = Why Not Everyone Gets Their Fair Share of Stress: Adolescent's Perceived Relationship Affection Mediates Associations Between Temperament and Subsequent Stressful Social Events | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1989/full| journal = European Journal of Personality| volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 125 | doi=10.1002/per.1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

Frustration can be considered a problem–response behavior and can have a number of effects, depending on the mental health of the individual. In positive cases, this frustration will build until a level that is too great for the individual to contain or allow to continue, and thus produce action directed at solving the inherent problem in a disposition that does not cause social or physical harm. In negative cases, however, the individual may perceive the source of frustration to be outside their control, and thus the frustration will continue to build, leading eventually to further problematic behavior (e.g. violent reaction against perceived oppressors or enemies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|title=Frustration-aggression hypothesis: Examination and reformulation.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=59–73|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubborn refusal to respond to new conditions affecting the goal, such as removal or modification of the barrier, sometimes occurs. As pointed out by [[J.A.C. Brown]], severe punishment may cause individuals to continue non-adaptive behavior blindly: "Either it may have an effect opposite to that of reward and as such, discourage the repetition of the act, or, by functioning as a frustrating agent, it may lead to fixation and the other symptoms of frustration as well. It follows that [[punishment]] is a dangerous tool, since it often has effects which are entirely the opposite of those desired".&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{Citation | first = JAC | last = Brown | title = The Social Psychology of Industry | place = Baltimore, MD | publisher = Penguin | year = 1954 | pages = 253–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frustration tolerance==
Frustration tolerance is one's ability to resist becoming frustrated when facing difficult tasks. Having a [[low frustration tolerance]] is related to trait anger and a higher level of frustration tolerance is related to lower levels of anger and longer persistence on difficult tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szasz|first1=P.L.|last2=Szentagotai|first2=A.|last3=Hofmann|first3=S.|title=The Effect of Emotion Regulation Strategies on Anger|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=30 November 2010|volume=49|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|accessdate=27 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child with a high frustration tolerance may be able to deal with repeated challenges and failures without experiencing significant frustration. The child with a low frustration tolerance can be quick to experience frustration when asked to perform tasks of moderate difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liden|first1=C.|title=9 Traits You Should Know About Your Temperament|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|website=The Being Well Center|accessdate=26 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Christian Ørsted''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜːr|s|t|ɛ|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oersted "Oersted"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-da|hans kʁæsdjan ˈɶɐ̯sdɛð|lang}}; often rendered '''Oersted''' in English; 14 August 1777{{spaced ndash}}9 March 1851) was a Danish [[physics|physicist]] and [[chemistry|chemist]] who discovered that [[electric current]]s create [[magnetic field]]s, which was the first connection found between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. [[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] (Oe) are named after him.

A leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], Ørsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.

==Early life and studies==
[[File:Hans Christian Ørsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young H. C. Ørsted]]
Ørsted was born in [[Rudkøbing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy.&lt;ref name="compilation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/oersted.htm|title=Hans Christian Ørsted |publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796 Ørsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.

In 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired Ørsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801 Ørsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ Inspiration fra Europa - planer i København] Niels Bohr Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany Ørsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to Ørsted as he subscribed to Kantian thought regarding the unity of nature.&lt;ref name="compilation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian, R.M. &amp; Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian Ørsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.

Ørsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812 Ørsted again visited Germany and France after publishing ''Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love'' and ''Første Indledning til den Almindelige Naturlære'' (1811).

Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term ''Gedankenexperiment'' circa 1812 and the German term ''Gedankenversuch'' in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen, J., "H.C. Ørsted, Immanuel Kant and the Thought Experiment", Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, Vol.13, (1976), pp. 48–65.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Electromagnetism==
[[File:17. Естердов експеримент.ogv|thumb|280px|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect Ørsted discovered. Demonstrated by Prof. Oliver Zajkov, Physics Institute at the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], Macedonia.]]
On 21 April 1820, during a lecture, Ørsted noticed a [[compass]] needle deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from a battery was switched on and off, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Ørsted (1997). Karen Jelved, Andrew D. Jackson, and Ole Knudsen, translators from Danish to English. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}}, pp.421-445&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, Roberto de Andrade, "[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V&amp;H%20Sect3/V&amp;H%20245-265.pdf Resistance to the discovery of [[electromagnetism]]: Ørsted and the symmetry of the magnetic field]", in: Fabio Bevilacqua &amp; Enrico Giannetto (eds.), ''Volta and the History of Electricity'', Pavia / Milano, Università degli Studi di Pavia / Editore Ulrico Hoepli, 2003, pp. 245-265. (Collana di Storia della Scienza) {{ISBN|88-203-3284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his discovery, the [[Royal Society of London]] awarded Ørsted the [[Copley Medal]] in 1820 and the French Academy granted him 3,000 [[French francs|francs]].

Ørsted's findings stirred much research into electrodynamics throughout the scientific community, influencing French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's work also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

==Later years==
[[File:Assistens Kirkegård - Hans Christian Ørsted.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone]]
Ørsted was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1822 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter O|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterO.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences, in 1824. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] and the [[European Patent Organisation|Danish Patent and Trademark Office]].
In 1829, Ørsted founded [[Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt]] ('College of Advanced Technology') which was later renamed the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|title=History of DTU|publisher=Technical University of Denmark|accessdate=2009-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902070101/http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, Ørsted made a significant contribution to [[chemistry]] by producing [[aluminium]] for the first time. While an aluminium-iron alloy had previously been developed by [[Humphry Davy]], Ørsted was the first to isolate the element via a reduction of [[aluminium chloride]].

Ørsted died in Copenhagen in 1851, aged 73, and was buried in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
The [[CGS|centimetre-gram-second system (CGS)]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named for his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

===Toponomy===
The [[Ørstedsparken|Ørsted Park]] in Copenhagen was named after Ørsted in 1879. The streets [[H.C. Ørsteds Vej]] in [[Frederiksberg]] and H. C. Ørsteds Allé in [[Galten, Denmark|Galten]] are also named after him.

The buildings that are home to the [[University of Copenhagen Department of Chemistry|Department of Chemistry]] and the [[University of Copenhagen Institute for Mathematical Sciences|Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s [[North Campus (University of Copenhagen)|North Campus]] are named the ''[[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute|H.C. Ørsted Institute]]'', after him. A dormitory named H. C. Ørsted Kollegiet is located in [[Odense]].

The [[Ørsted (satellite)|first Danish satellite]], launched 1999, was named after Ørsted.

===Monuments and memorials===
[[File:Statue of Hans Christian Øersted, Øerstedsparken, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Ørsted in [[Ørstedsparken]], in Copenhagen.]]
A [[The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted|statue of Hans Christian Ørsted]] was installed in the Ørsted Park in 1880. A commemorative plaque is located above the gate on the building in [[Studiestræde]] where he lived and worked. The 100 [[Danish krone|danske kroner]] note issued from 1950 to 1970 carried an engraving of Ørsted.

===Awards and lectures===
Two medals are awarded in Ørsted's name: the [[Oersted Medal]] for notable contributions in the teaching of physics in America, awarded by [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], along with the [[H. C. Ørsted Medal]] for Danish scientists, awarded by the Danish ''Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse'' (Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science), founded by Ørsted. 

The H.C. Ørsted Lectureship is awarded to two prominent researchers annually.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A '''happening''' is a performance, event, or [[Situationist International|situation]] meant to be considered [[art]], usually as [[performance art]]. The term was first used by [[Allan Kaprow]] during the 1950s to describe a range of art-related event or multiple events.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Happenings occur anywhere and are often multi-disciplinary, with a [[nonlinear narrative]] and the active participation of the audience. Key elements of happenings are planned but artists sometimes retain room for [[improvisation]].  This [[new media art]] aspect to happenings eliminates the boundary between the artwork and its viewer.

In the late 1960s, perhaps due to the depiction in films of [[hippie]] culture, the term was used much less specifically to mean any gathering of interest from a [[pool hall]] meetup or a [[jam session|jamming]] of a few young people to a beer blast or fancy formal party.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:SurvivalResearch2006.jpg|thumb|[[Survival Research Laboratories]] Performance in L.A. 2006]]
[[Allan Kaprow]] first coined the term "happening" in the spring of 1959 at an art picnic at [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]'s farm to describe the art pieces that were going on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical Introduction to Twentieth-Century American Drama: Volume 3 Beyond Broadway |author=Christopher W. Bigsby |authorlink=Christopher Bigsby |year=1985 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521278966 |page=45 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gZPUSNnDXwC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Allan%20Kaprow%20coined%20happening&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Allan%20Kaprow%20coined%20happening&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance in print was in Kaprow's famous "Legacy of Jackson Pollock" essay that was published in 1958 but primarily written in 1956. "Happening" also appeared in print in one issue of the [[Fluxus at Rutgers University|Rutgers University]] undergraduate literary magazine, ''Anthologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Marter and Simon Anderson, ''Off Limits: Rutgers University and the [[Avant-Garde]], 1957-1963'', [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1999, p10. {{ISBN|0-8135-2610-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form was imitated and the term was adopted by artists across the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]]. [[Jack Kerouac]] referred to Kaprow as "The Happenings man", and an ad showing a woman floating in outer space declared, "I dreamt I was in a happening in my [[Maidenform]] brassiere".{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Happenings are difficult to describe, in part because each one is unique and completely different from one another.  One definition comes from [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin|Wardrip-Fruin]] and [[Nick Montfort|Montfort]] in ''The New Media Reader'', "The term 'Happening' has been used to describe many performances and events, organized by Allan Kaprow and others during the 1950s and 1960s, including a number of theatrical productions that were traditionally scripted and invited only limited audience interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, eds., ''The New Media Reader'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2003): p.&amp;nbsp;83. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is, "a purposefully composed form of theatre in which diverse alogical elements, including nonmatrixed performing, are organized in a compartmented structure".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kirby, ''Happenings: An Illustrated Anthology'', scripts and productions by Jim Dine, Red Grooms, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Canadian theatre critic and playwright [[Gary Botting]], who himself had "constructed" several happenings, wrote in 1972: "Happenings abandoned the matrix of story and plot for the equally complex matrix of incident and event."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings," in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaprow was a student of [[John Cage]], who had experimented with "musical happenings" at [[Black Mountain College]] as early as 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings", in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaprow combined the theatrical and visual arts with discordant music. "His happenings incorporated the use of huge constructions or sculptures similar to those suggested by Artaud," wrote  Botting, who also compared them to the "impermanent art" of Dada. "A happening explores negative space in the same way Cage explored silence. It is a form of symbolism: actions concerned with 'now' or fantasies derived from life, or organized structures of events appealing to archetypal symbolic associations."&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; A "Happening" of the same performance will have  different outcomes because each performance depends on the action of the audience.  In New York City especially, "Happenings" became quite popular even though many had neither seen nor experienced them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--It is difficult to believe this is even possible; who says so?--&gt;

Happenings can be a form of participatory new media art, emphasizing an interaction between the performer and the audience. In his ''Water'', [[Robert Whitman]] had the performers drench each other with coloured water. "One girl squirmed between wet inner tubes, ultimately struggling through a large silver vulva."&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], best known for his innovative sculptures, used a vacant house, his own store, and the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Los Angeles for ''Injun'', ''World's Fair II'' and ''AUT OBO DYS''.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was to break down the fourth wall between performer and spectator; with the involvement of the spectator as performer, objective criticism is transformed into subjective support. For some happenings, everyone present is included in the making of the art and even the form of the art depends on audience engagement, for they are a key factor in where the performers' spontaneity leads.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings," 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Later happenings had no set rules, only vague guidelines that the performers follow based on surrounding props. Unlike other forms of art, Happenings that allow chance to enter are ever-changing. When chance determines the path the performance will follow, there is no room for failure. As Kaprow wrote in his essay, "'Happenings' in the New York Scene", "Visitors to a Happening are now and then not sure what has taken place, when it has ended, even when things have gone 'wrong'. For when something goes 'wrong', something far more 'right,' more revelatory, has many times emerged".&lt;ref&gt;''New Media Reader'', p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaprow's piece ''18 Happenings in 6 Parts'' (1959) is commonly cited as the first happening, although that distinction is sometimes given to a 1952 performance of ''Theater Piece No. 1'' at [[Black Mountain College]] by [[John Cage]], one of Kaprow's teachers in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, "Happenings", 13&lt;/ref&gt; Cage stood reading from a ladder, [[Charles Olson]] read from another ladder, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] showed some of his paintings and played wax cylinders of [[Édith Piaf]] on an Edison horn recorder, [[David Tudor]] performed on a [[prepared piano]] and [[Merce Cunningham]] danced.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Dale Hobbs, ''The End of the American Avant Garde'', NYU Press, 1997, p109. {{ISBN|0-8147-3539-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All these things took place at the same time, among the audience rather than on a stage.  Happenings flourished in [[New York City]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Key contributors to the form included [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Red Grooms]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[Jim Dine]] ''Car Crash'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/BeckyWalker/Becky_Descriptions.htm Performance Descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709225423/http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/BeckyWalker/Becky_Descriptions.htm |date=2010-07-09 }} Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Delford Brown]], [[Lucas Samaras]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Some of their work is documented in Michael Kirby's book ''Happenings'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kirby, ''Happenings: An Illustrated Anthology'', scripts and productions by Jim Dine, Red Grooms, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Kaprow claimed that "some of us will become famous, and we will have proven once again that the only success occurred when there was a lack of it".&lt;ref&gt;New Media Reader, p 87&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 [[Wolf Vostell]] made the Happening ''TV-Burying'' at the [[Fluxus at Rutgers University#Yam Festival|Yam Festival]] in coproduction with the [[Smolin Gallery]] and in 1964 the Happening ''You'' in [[Great Neck, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/images/2/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: TV Burying|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=25 September 2017|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/ Happening ''You'', Great Neck, New York, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1959, [[Red Grooms]] along with others (Yvonne Andersen, Bill Barrell, Sylvia Small and Dominic Falcone) staged the non-narrative "play" ''Walking Man'', which began with construction sounds, such as sawing. Grooms recalls, "The curtains were opened by me, playing a fireman wearing a simple costume of white pants and T-shirt with a poncholike cloak and a Smokey Stoverish fireman's helmet. Bill, the 'star' in a tall hat and black overcoat, walked back and forth across the stage with great wooden gestures. Yvonne sat on the floor by a suspended fire engine. She was a blind woman with tin-foil covered glasses and cup. Sylvia played a radio and pulled on hanging junk. For the finale, I hid behand a false door and shouted pop code words. Then the cast did a wild run around and it ended".&lt;ref name="Early Years"&gt;Judith Stein, "The Early Years: 1937-1960", ''Red Grooms: A Retrospective'' (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbing his 148 Delancey Street studio The Delancey Street Museum, Grooms staged three more happenings there, ''A Garden'', ''The Burning Building'' and ''The Magic Trainride'' (originally titled ''Fireman's Dream''). No wonder Kaprow called Grooms "a Charlie Chaplin forever dreaming about fire".&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt; On the opening night of ''The Burning Building'', [[Bob Thompson (painter)|Bob Thompson]] solicited an audience member for a light, since none of the cast had one, and this gesture of spontaneous theater recurred in eight subsequent performances.&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt;
The Japanese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]] staged [[nude]] happenings during the late '60s in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/52ab168a-4188-11e1-8c33-00144feab49a.html#axzz1kDck8rzm|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/scream_against_the_sky_yayoi_kusamas_self_obliteration|title=Scream Against the Sky: Yayoi Kusama’s Self-Obliteration, avant garde weirdness, 1967|date=15 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happenings emphasize the organic connection between art and its environment. Kaprow supports that "happenings invite us to cast aside for a moment these proper manners and partake wholly in the real nature of the art and life. It is a rough and sudden act, where one often feels "dirty", and dirt, we might begin to realize, is also organic and fertile, and everything including the visitors can grow a little into such circumstances." 
Happenings have no plot or philosophy, but rather is materialized in an improvisatory fashion. There is no direction thus the outcome is unpredictable. "It is generated in action by a headful of ideas...and it frequently has words but they may or may not make literal sense. If they do, their meaning is not representational of what the whole element conveys. Hence they carry a brief, detached quality. If they do not make sense, then they are acknowledgement of the sound of the word rather than the meaning conveyed by it."{{Citequote|date=June 2017}}

Due to the convention's nature, there is no such term as "failure" which can be applied. "For when something goes "wrong", something far more "right", more revelatory may emerge. This sort of sudden near-miracle presently is made more likely by chance procedures." As a conclusion, a happening is fresh while it lasts and cannot be reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding happenings, [[Red Grooms]] has remarked, "I had the sense that I knew it was something. I knew it was something because I didn't know what it was. I think that's when you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is."&lt;ref name="Early Years"/&gt;

The lack of plot as well as the expected audience participation can be likened to Augusto Boal's [[Theater of the Oppressed]], which also claims that "spectator is a bad word". Boal expected audience members to participate in the theater of the oppressed by becoming the actors. His goal was to allow the downtrodden to act out the forces oppressing them in order to mobilize the people into political action. Both Kaprow and Boal are reinventing theater to try to make plays more interactive and to abolish the traditional narrative form to make theater something more free-form and organic.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Boal, "Theater of the Oppressed", in ''The New Media Reader'', edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, London: The MIT Press, 2003, p 341–52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contribution toward digital media===

[[Allan Kaprow]]'s and other artists of the 1950s and 1960s that performed these Happenings helped put "new media technology developments into context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Montfort |first1=Nick |last2=Wardrip-Fruin |first2=Noah|date=February 2003 |title=The New Media Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQYXoRx9CcEC&amp;pg=PT102 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=The MIT Press |page=83 |isbn=9780262232272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Happenings allowed other artists to create performances that would attract attention to the issue they wanted to portray. Currently happenings today can be found with Jazz in a whole new way through the artistic collaboration of renowned musicians American saxophonist [[David Liebman]], French jazz pianist Jean-Marie Machado, and multimedia visual artist [[Barbara Januszkiewicz]]. their group Jazz Vision Trio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jazzvisiontrion.info {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712085033/http://www.jazzvisiontrion.info/ |date=2017-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using new media techniques and real-time improvising with jazz and art.

===Around the world===
In 1959 the French artist [[Yves Klein]] first performed [[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for [[gold]]; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref name="Stich"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p156&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;

In 1960, [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]] oversaw and partook in the first European Happening ''L'enterrement de la Chose'' in [[Venice]]. For his performance there – called ''Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process'' – Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped 'cadaver' rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an 'executioner' while a 'service' was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] and le [[Marquis de Sade]]. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the 'body' – which was a mechanical sculpture by [[Jean Tinguely]] – was ceremonially slid into the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], 2009. p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet and painter [[Adrian Henri]] claimed to have organized the first happenings in England in [[Liverpool]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Moore-Gilbert, ''Cultural Revolution?: The Challenge of the Arts in the 1960s'', Routledge, 1992, p90. {{ISBN|0-415-07824-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking place during the Merseyside Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Berghaus, "Happenings in Europe: Trends, Events and Leading Figures", in ''Happenings and Other Acts'', edited by Mariellen R.

One of the participants, [[Jeff Nuttall]], went on to organize a number of further happenings, often working with his friend [[Bob Cobbing]], [[sound poetry|sound poet]] and [[performance poetry|performance poet]].

In [[Tokyo]] in 1964, [[Yoko Ono]] created a happening by performing her "Cut Piece" at the Sogetsu Art Center. She walked onto the stage draped in fabric, presented the audience with a pair of scissors, and instructed the audience to cut the fabric away gradually until the performer decides they should stop.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Concannon, "[http://kevinconcannon.squarespace.com/storage/pdf/CutPiecePAJ.pdf Yoko Ono's ''Cut Piece'': From Text to Performance and Back Again]" ''PAJ—A Journal of Performance and Art'' 30, no. 3 (September 2008): 81–93, citation on 81–82. doi:0.1162.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--Invalid doi.--&gt; Retrieved July 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], the first happenings were organized around 1965–1968 in [[Antwerp]], [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] by artists [[Hugo Heyrman]] and [[Panamarenko]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the first documented happening took place in 1961, with the Dutch artist and performer Wim T. Schippers emptying a bottle of soda water in the North Sea near Petten. Later on, he organized random walks in the Amsterdam City Centre.  [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] organized happenings around the little statue "Het Lieverdje" on the Spui, a square in the centre of [[Amsterdam]], from 1966 till 1968. [[Police]] often raided these events.

In the 1960s [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Dick Higgins]], and [[HA Schult]] staged Happenings in Germany.

In Canada, [[Gary Botting]] created or "constructed" happenings between 1969 (in St. John's, Newfoundland) and 1972 (in Edmonton, Alberta), including ''The Aeolian Stringer'' in which a "captive" audience was entangled in string emanating from a vacuum cleaner as it made its rounds (similar to Kaprow's "A Spring Happening", where he used a power lawnmower and huge electric fan to similar effect); ''Zen Rock Festival'' in which the central icon was a huge rock with which the audience interacted in unpredictable ways; ''Black on Black'' held in the Edmonton Art Gallery; and "Pipe Dream," set in a men's washroom with an all-female "cast".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], "Happenings" in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the [[Yellow House Artist Collective]] in [[Sydney]] housed 24-hour happenings throughout the early 1970s.

Behind the [[Iron Curtain]], in [[Poland]], artist and theater director [[Tadeusz Kantor]] staged the first happenings starting in 1965. In the second half of 1970s painter and performer [[Krzysztof Jung]] ran the Repassage gallery, which promoted performance art in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;''Krzysztof Jung''. Catalogue of the exhibition edited by Grzegorz Kowalski and Maryla Sitkowska, Warsaw 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the second half of the 1980s, a student-based happening movement [[Orange Alternative]] founded by Major [[Waldemar Fydrych]] became known for its much attended happenings (over 10 thousand participants at one time) aimed against the military regime led by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|General Jaruzelski]] and the fear blocking the Polish society ever since the [[Martial Law]] had been imposed in December 1981.

Since 1993 the artist [[Jens Galschiøt]] have made political happenings all over the [[world]], in November 1993 he made the happening [[my inner beast]] where twenty sculptures were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities all over [[Europe]]. [[Pillar of Shame]] is a series of Galschiøt's sculptures. The first was erected in [[Hong Kong]] on 4 June 1997, ahead of the handover from British to Chinese rule on 1 July 1997, as a protest against China's crackdown of the  [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. On 1 May 1999, a [[Pillar of Shame]] was set up on the Zócalo&lt;ref name="zocalo"&gt;{{cite book

It stood for two days in front of the Parliament to protest the oppression of the region's indigenous people.

The non-profit, artist-run organization, iKatun,&lt;ref&gt;ikatun.com&lt;/ref&gt; artist group, The Institute of Infinitely Small Things, has reflected the use of "Happenings" influence while incorporating the medium of internet. Their aim is one that "fosters public engagement in the politics of information".{{Full citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Their project entitled ''The International Database of Corporate Commands'' presents a scrutinizing look at the super-saturating advertisements slogans, and "commands" of companies.   "The Institute for Infinitely Small Things uses these commands to conduct research performances- performances in which we attempt to enact, as literally as possible, what the command tells us to do and where it tells us to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Ignazio|first1=Catherine|title=Corporate Commands|url=http://www.ikatun.org/kanarinka/corporate-commands/|website=ikatun.org|publisher=kanarinka projects|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a user may look at a long list of slogans on the website database section, and may submit, in text, his or her take on the most literal way to act out the slogan/ command.  The iKatun team will then act out the slogan in a research-performance related way.

===Philosophy===
Kaprow explains that happenings are not a new style, but a moral act, a human stand of great urgency, whose professional status as art is less critical than their certainty as an ultimate existential commitment. He argues that once artists have been recognized and paid, they also surrender to the confinement, rather the tastes of the patrons (even if that may not be the intention on both ends). "The whole situation is corrosive, neither patrons nor artists comprehend their role...and out of this hidden discomfort comes a stillborn art, tight or merely repetitive and at worst, chic." Though the we may easily blame those offering the temptation, Kaprow reminds us that it is not the publicist's moral obligation to protect the artist's freedom, and artists themselves hold the ultimate power to reject fame if they do not want its responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals as happenings==
Art and music festivals play a large role in positive and successful happenings. Some of these festivals include [[Burning Man]] and [[Oregon Country Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/faqs.php|title=FAQs «  Oregon Country Fair|website=www.oregoncountryfair.org|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/faq_what_is.html#Tickets|title=Event FAQ - Burning Man|website=www.burningman.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the famous [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Burning Man]] frowns on the idea of spectators and stresses the importance of everyone being involved to create something amazing and unique. Both parties embody the "audience" and instead of creating something to show the people, the people become involved in helping create something incredible and spontaneous to the moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khtt.net/page/13520/en|title=sandra1985adisa@yahoo.com|website=Khatt Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--"Burning Man" is not mentioned on this website, let alone what the relationship with the audience might be.--&gt; Both of these events are happenings that are recreated and special each year and are always new and organic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2463">In [[mathematics]], '''Hudde's rules''' are two [[properties of polynomial roots]] described by [[Johann Hudde]].

1. If ''r'' is a [[double root]] of the polynomial equation
::&lt;math&gt;a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}x + a_n = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:and if &lt;math&gt;b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{n-1}, b_n&lt;/math&gt; are numbers in [[arithmetic progression]], then ''r'' is also a [[root]] of
::&lt;math&gt;a_0b_0x^n + a_1b_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}b_{n-1}x + a_nb_n = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
:This definition is a form of the modern [[theorem]] that if ''r'' is a double root of ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then ''r'' is a root of ''ƒ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

2. If for ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' the polynomial
::&lt;math&gt;a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}x + a_n &lt;/math&gt;
:takes on a relative [[maximum]] or [[minimum]] [[Value (mathematics)|value]], then ''a'' is a root of the equation
::&lt;math&gt;na_0x^n + (n-1)a_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + 2a_{n-2}x^2 + a_{n-1}x = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
:This definition is a modification of [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]] in the form that if ''ƒ''(''a'') is a relative maximum or minimum value of a polynomial ''ƒ''(''x''), then ''ƒ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''a'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''ƒ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the [[derivative]] of ''ƒ''.

Hudde was working with [[Frans van Schooten]] on a [[Latin]] edition of [[La Géométrie]] of [[René Descartes]]. In the 1859 edition of the translation, Hudde contributed two letters: "Epistola prima de Redvctione Ǣqvationvm" (pages 406 to 506), and "Epistola secvnda de Maximus et Minimus" (pages 507 to 16). These letters may be read by the Internet Archive link below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13091">'''Illusory conjunctions''' are psychological effects in which participants combine features of two objects into one object. There are [[visual]] illusory conjunctions, [[auditory illusion|auditory]] illusory conjunctions, and illusory conjunctions produced by combinations of visual and tactile stimuli. Visual illusory conjunctions are thought to occur due to a lack of visual spatial attention, which depends on fixation and (amongst other things) the amount of time allotted to focus on an object. With a short span of time to interpret an object, blending of different aspects within a region of the [[visual field]] – like shapes and colors – can occasionally be skewed, which results in visual illusory conjunctions. For example, in a study designed by [[Anne Treisman]] and Schmidt participants were required to view a visual presentation of numbers and shapes in different colors. Some shapes were larger than others but all shapes and numbers were evenly spaced and shown for just 200 ms (followed by a mask). When the participants were asked to recall the shapes they reported answers such as a ''small green triangle'' instead of a ''small green circle''. If the space between the objects is smaller, illusory conjunctions occur more often.

==Visual==

Along with [[feature integration]], the location of the perceived illusory object in vision is a combined result of the constituent objects' locations, but the similarity of the features is what increases the likelihood of an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazeltine, R. E., Prinzmetal, W., &amp; Elliott, K. (1997). If it's not there, where is it? Locating illusory conjunctions. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 23(1), 263-263-277. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.23.1.263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an illusory conjunction to occur, the two objects that are not the focus of attention need to be within the visual field. The closer two objects are, the more likely the illusory conjunction is to occur.&lt;ref name="CohenIvry"&gt;Cohen, A., &amp; Ivry, R. (1989). Illusory conjunctions inside and outside the focus of attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 15(4), 650-650-663. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.15.4.650}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased likelihood of an illusory conjunction to occur when the objects are closer together may be due to a difference in processing compared with when the objects are more distant from each other. One theory supports that the decrease in illusory conjunctions with increased distance between objects is due to the use of bi-hemispheric input processing, making closer objects more likely to be conjoined because only one of the [[cerebral hemispheres]] sees and processes both objects that are involved in an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Liederman, J. &amp; Sohn, Y. (1999). Presentation of words to separate hemispheres prevents interword illusory conjunctions. International Journal of Neuroscience, Vol 97(1-2), 1999, 1-16. {{doi|10.3109/00207459908994299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although proximity increases the likelihood of an illusory conjunction, illusory conjunctions formed between objects can occur even when the objects are distant, though still within the attentional field. When objects are outside of attention in order for an illusory conjunction to occur they must be adjacent to each other to combine features.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A., &amp; Ivry, R. B. (1991). Density effects in conjunction search: Evidence for a coarse location mechanism of feature integration. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 17(4), 891-901. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.17.4.891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects become more susceptible to illusory conjunction not only due to relation to each other, but also in relation to the density of objects in the attentional location. As the density of objects increases, there is more division of attention, which increases the possibility of forming of an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref name="PCDTT"&gt;Pelli, D. G.,  Cavanagh, P., Desimone, R.,  Tjan, B.,  &amp; Treisman, A. (2007).  Crowding: Including illusory conjunctions, surround suppression, and attention.  Journal of Vision, Vol 7(2), 2007, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative theories==

It has been suggested that research in support of illusory conjunctions is not adequate in terms of the methods used to analyze the data. If this criticism were found to be true, it would support the theory that illusory conjunctions are only illusions and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;Donk, M. (2001). Illusory conjunctions die hard: A reply to prinzmetal, diedrichsen, and irvy (2001). Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27(3), 542-542-546. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.27.3.542}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found in a few studies on visual illusory conjunctions that two objects that are not the focus of attention are also more likely to be combined when they are adjacent to each other. Although it would seem more common for objects to combine when they are not the focus of attention it is more likely for an illusory conjunction to occur when objects are the focus of attention.&lt;ref name="CohenIvry"/&gt; Visual illusory conjunctions can occur in long and brief exposure times along with the different levels of attention paid to the objects involved.&lt;ref&gt;Prinzmetal, W., Henderson, D., &amp; Ivry, R. (1995). Loosening the constraints on illusory conjunctions: Assessing the roles of exposure duration and attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21(6), 1362-1362-1375. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.21.6.1362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==

Illusory conjunctions can also occur in [[memory]]. In vision, images can be combined through a lapse in memory of an image that is filled by physical stimuli&lt;ref&gt;Craver-Lemley, C., Arterberry, M. E., &amp; Reeves, A. (1999). "Illusory" illusory conjunctions: The conjoining of features of visual and imagined stimuli. Journal of Experimenta Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 25(4), 1036-1036-1049. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.25.4.1036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory conjunctions often occur through memory errors because the situations in which illusory conjunctions happen involve multiple tasks or tasks that commonly divide a person's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Navon, D. &amp; Ehrlich, B. (1995). Illusory conjunctions: Does inattention really matter?" ''Cognitive Psychology'', Vol 29(1), Aug 1995, 59-83. {{doi|10.1006/cogp.1995.1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While memory errors can aid in the formation of illusory conjunctions their formation is not dependent on memory errors.&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. &amp; Schmidt, H. (1982). Illusory conjunctions in the perception of objects" ''Cognitive Psychology'', Vol 14(1), Jan 1982, 107-141. {{doi|10.1016/0010-0285(82)90006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These memory errors can be caused by a multitude of objects in a space increases the amount of things to be processed and stored to memory increases. This increase in objects creates a prime situation for memory to lapse and form an illusory conjunction.&lt;ref name="PCDTT"/&gt; Illusory conjunctions in short term auditory memory occur also. When a set of tones is played in a sequence, illusory conjunctions of 'what' and 'when' can occur. For example, if a sequence of tones begins with the note C, and later includes the note C#,  and the note C# is repeated at the end of the sequence, there is a tendency for listeners to assume erroneously that this last note had also been the first note in the sequence.&lt;ref name="phil-27"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Dislocation of Tones in a Musical Sequence: a Memory Illusion. | journal=Nature | volume=226 | pages=286 | year=1970 | doi=10.1038/226286a0 | issue=5242}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v226/n5242/abs/226286a0.html Weblink] [http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/pdf/Nature-1970_226_p286.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Illusory conjunctions of pitch and duration in tone sequences also occur.&lt;ref name="Thompson, W. F. 2001"&gt;Thompson, W. F., Hall, M. D., &amp; Pressing, J. (2001). Illusory conjunctions of pitch and duration in unfamiliar tone sequences. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27(1), 128-128-140. {{doi|10.1037/0096-1523.27.1.128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory==

Auditory illusory conjunctions occur either when two sounds are presented in different positions in space, but a single sound is heard, or when two different sounds are presented in different positions in space, but some of them are heard in the wrong spatial location. In the [[octave illusion]], the listener is presented via earphones with a 20-second sequence consisting of two alternating tones that are an octave apart, and are repeatedly presented in alternation. The tones are 250 ms in duration.  The same sequence is presented to the two ears, but when the right ear receives the high tone the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most listeners hear this sequence as a single tone that repeatedly changes both in pitch and in location.&lt;ref name="phil-85"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=An auditory illusion | journal=Nature | volume=251 | pages=307–309 | year=1974 | pmid=4427654 | doi=10.1038/251307a0 | issue=5473}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v251/n5473/abs/251307a0.html Weblink] [http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/pdf/Nature-1974_251_307-309.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that time limitations contribute to this auditory illusory conjunction&lt;ref name="Thompson, W.

==Vision and touch==

Illusory conjunctions can also occur between vision and touch. This happens when a seen object is attributed to textures that someone is feeling. This phenomenon is also more common when only one of the cerebral hemispheres is perceiving and processing the visual and tactile stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Cinel, C., Humphreys, G. W., &amp;  Poli, R. (2002). Cross-modal illusory conjunctions between vision and touch.

'''Irrelevant conclusion''',&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Whately, cited by [[John Stuart Mill]]: ''A System of Logic''. London Colchester 1959 (first: 1843), pp. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''''ignoratio elenchi''''' ({{langnf||Latin|an ignoring of a refutation}}) or '''missing the point''', is the [[informal fallacy|informal]] [[fallacy]] of presenting an [[argument]] that may or may not be logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]] and [[soundness|sound]], but (whose conclusion) fails to address the issue in question. It falls into the broad class of [[relevance]] fallacies.&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"/&gt;

Irrelevant conclusion should not be confused with [[formal fallacy]], an argument whose conclusion does not follow from its [[premise]]s.

==Overview==
''Ignoratio elenchi'' is one of the fallacies identified by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Organon]]''. In a broader sense he asserted that all fallacies are a form of ''ignoratio elenchi''.&lt;ref name="Owen 1878"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Organon, or Logical treatises, of Aristotle |author=Aristotle |others=Octavius Freire Owen (translation) |year=1878 |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=Covent Garden |volume=2 |pages=548–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignoratio.html |title=Ignoratio Elenchi |work=Introduction to Logic |date=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Ignoratio Elenchi'', according to Aristotle, is a fallacy which arises from "ignorance of the nature of refutation". In order to refute an assertion, Aristotle says we must prove its contradictory; the proof, consequently, of a proposition which stood in any other relation than that to the original, would be an ''ignoratio elenchi''.   Since Aristotle, the scope of the fallacy has been extended to include all cases of proving the wrong point… "I am required to prove a certain conclusion; I prove, not that, but one which is likely to be mistaken for it; in that lies the fallacy… For instance, instead of proving that ‘this person has committed an atrocious fraud’, you prove that ‘this fraud he is accused of is atrocious;’" … The nature of the fallacy, then, consists in substituting for a certain issue another which is more or less closely related to it, and arguing the substituted issue. The fallacy does not take into account whether the arguments do or do not really support the substituted issue, it only calls attention to the fact that they do not constitute a proof of the original one… It is a particularly prevalent and subtle fallacy and it assumes a great variety of forms. But whenever it occurs and whatever form it takes, it is brought about by an assumption that leads the person guilty of it to substitute for a definite subject of inquiry another which is in close relation with it.&lt;ref name="Davies1915"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Ernest |last=Davies |year=1915 |title=A Text-Book of Logic |publisher=R.

● '''Example 1''': A and B are debating as to whether criticizing indirectly has any merit in general. 
:''A'': There is no point in people ranting on social media about politics; the president is not going to read it anyway.
:''B'': But it is their social media. People can agree on making a petition or convey notice from many others that they will be signing one based on their concerns.
:''A'': Well, I do not keep up with it anyway.

A attempts to support their position with an argument that politics ought not to be criticized on social media because the message is not directly being heard by the head of state; this would make them guilty of ''ignoratio elenchi'', as people such as B may be criticizing politics because they have a strong message for their peers, or because they wish to bring attention to political matters, rather than ever intending that their views would be directly read by the president.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Fowler, ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''. Entry for ''ignoratio elenchi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

● '''Example 2''': A and B are debating about the law.
:''A'': Does the law allow me to do that?
:''B'': The law ''should'' allow you to do that because this and that.

B missed the point. The question was not if the law should allow, but if it does or not.

[[Dr Johnson]]'s unique "refutation" of [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley's]] [[immaterialism]], his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as ''ignoratio elenchi'':&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, Nicholas. ''Books: Paperbacks'', [[The Sunday Telegraph]] 3 March 1996&lt;/ref&gt; during a conversation with [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Johnson powerfully kicked a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, "I refute it ''thus''!"&lt;ref name="Boswell p. 122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[argumentum ad lapidem]]''.)

A related concept is that of the [[red herring]], which is a deliberate attempt to divert a process of enquiry by changing the subject.&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick J.

The phrase ''ignoratio elenchi'' is {{ety|la||an ignoring of a refutation}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">In [[mathematics]] and especially [[number theory]], the '''sum of reciprocals''' generally is computed for the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of some or all of the [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s (counting numbers)&amp;mdash;that is, it is generally the sum of [[unit fraction]]s.  If infinitely many numbers have their reciprocals summed, generally the terms are given in a certain sequence and the first ''n'' of them are summed, then one more is included to give the sum of the first ''n''+1 of them, etc.

If only finitely many numbers are included, the key issue is usually to find a simple expression for the value of the sum, or to require the sum to be less than a certain value, or to determine whether the sum is ever an integer.

For an [[infinite series]] of reciprocals, the issues are twofold: First, does the sequence of sums [[divergent series|diverge]]—that is, does it eventually exceed any given number—or does it [[convergent series|converge]], meaning there is some number that it gets arbitrarily close to without ever exceeding it? (A set of positive integers is said to be [[large set (combinatorics)|large]] if the sum of its reciprocals diverges, and small if it converges.) Second, if it converges, what is a simple expression for the value it converges to, is that value [[rational number|rational]] or [[irrational number|irrational]], and is that value [[algebraic number|algebraic]] or [[transcendental number|transcendental]]?&lt;ref&gt;Unless given here, references are in the linked articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finitely many terms==

*The [[harmonic mean]] of a set of positive integers is the number of numbers times the reciprocal of the sum of their reciprocals.
*The [[optic equation]] requires the sum of the reciprocals of two positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' to equal the reciprocal of a third positive integer ''c''. All solutions are given by ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mn''. This equation appears in various contexts in elementary [[geometry]].
*The [[Fermat–Catalan conjecture]] concerns a certain [[Diophantine equation]], equating the sum of two terms, each a positive integer raised to a positive integer power, to a third term that is also a positive integer raised to a positive integer power (with the base integers having no prime factor in common). The conjecture asks whether the equation has an infinitude of solutions in which the sum of the reciprocals of the three exponents in the equation must be less than 1. The purpose of this restriction is to preclude the known infinitude of solutions in which two exponents are 2 and the other exponent is any even number.
*The ''n''-th [[harmonic number]], which is the sum of the reciprocals of the first ''n'' positive integers, is never an integer except for the case&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
*Moreover, [[József Kürschák]] proved in 1918 that the sum of the reciprocals of consecutive natural numbers (whether starting from 1 or not) is never an integer.
*The sum of the [[Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes#Partial sums|reciprocals of the first ''n'' primes]] is not an integer for any ''n''.
*There are [[215 (number)|215]] non-consecutive sequences of four integers, counting re-arrangements as distinct, such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1. There are 14 of them if rearrangements are not allowed.
*An [[Egyptian fraction]] is the sum of a finite number of reciprocals of positive integers. According to the proof of the [[Erdős–Graham problem]], if the set of [[integer]]s greater than one is [[Partition of a set|partition]]ed into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets can be used to form an [[Egyptian fraction]] representation of 1.
*The [[Erdős–Straus conjecture]] states that for all integers ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the rational number 4/''n''  can be expressed as the sum of three reciprocals of integers.
*The [[Fermat quotient#Special values|Fermat quotient]] with base 2, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; for odd prime ''p'', when expressed in [[modular arithmetic|mod]] ''p'' and multiplied by –2, equals the sum of the reciprocals mod&amp;nbsp;''p'' of the numbers lying in the first half of the range&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}.
*In any [[triangle]], the sum of the reciprocals of the [[altitude (triangle)#Inradius theorems|altitudes]] equals the reciprocal of the [[radius]] of the [[incircle]] (regardless of whether or not they are integers).
*In a [[right triangle]], the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the altitudes from the legs (equivalently, of the squares of the legs themselves) equals the reciprocal of the square of the altitude from the hypotenuse. This holds whether or not the numbers are integers; there is a formula (see [[integer triangle#Pythagorean triangles with integer altitude from the hypotenuse|here]]) that generates all integer cases.
*A triangle not necessarily in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be specified as having angles &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{p},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{q},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Then the triangle is in Euclidean space if the sum of the reciprocals of ''p, q,'' and ''r'' equals 1, [[spherical trigonometry|spherical space]] if that sum is greater than 1, and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic space]] if the sum is less than 1.
*A [[harmonic divisor number]] is a positive integer whose divisors have a [[harmonic mean]] that is an integer. The first five of these are 1, 6, 28, 140, and 270. It is not known whether any harmonic divisor numbers are odd, but there are no odd ones less than 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The sum of the reciprocals of the [[divisor]]s of a [[perfect number]] is 2.
*When eight points are distributed on the surface of a [[sphere]] with the aim of maximizing the distance between them in some sense, the resulting shape corresponds to a [[square antiprism]].  Specific methods of distributing the points include, for example, minimizing the sum of all reciprocals of squares of distances between points.

==Infinitely many terms==

===Convergent series===
{{For|various series of reciprocals that sum to a power of pi|List of formulae involving π#Other infinite series}}

*A [[sum-free sequence]] of increasing positive integers is one for which no number is the sum of any [[subset]] of the previous ones. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in any sum-free sequence is less than 2.8570.
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[heptagonal number]]s converges to a known value that is not only [[irrational number|irrational]] but also [[transcendental number|transcendental]], and for which there exists a [[Heptagonal number#Sum of reciprocals|complicated formula]].
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[twin prime]]s, of which there may be finitely many or infinitely many, is known to be finite and is called [[Brun's constant]], approximately 1.9022.
*The [[prime quadruplet]]s are pairs of twin primes with only one odd number between them. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in prime quadruplets is approximately 0.8706.
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[perfect power#Examples and sums|perfect powers]] (including duplicates) is 1.
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[perfect power#Examples and sums|perfect powers]] (excluding duplicates) is approximately 0.8745.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PerfectPower|title=Perfect Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Goldbach–Euler theorem]] states that the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers that are 1 less than a perfect power (excluding duplicates) is 1.
*The sum of the reciprocals of all the non-zero [[triangular number#Other properties|triangular numbers]] is&amp;nbsp;2.
*The [[reciprocal Fibonacci constant]] is the sum of the reciprocals of the [[Fibonacci number]]s, which is known to be finite and irrational and approximately equal to 3.3599. For other finite sums of subsets of the reciprocals of Fibonacci numbers, see [[Fibonacci number#Reciprocal sums|here]].
*An [[exponential factorial]] is a number obtained by the process of raising ''n'' to the power ''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1, then raising the result to the power ''n'' – 2, and so forth. The sum of the reciprocals of the exponential factorials from 1 onward is approximately 1.6111 and is transcendental.
*A [[powerful number]] is a positive integer for which every prime appearing in its [[prime factorization]] appears there at least twice. The sum of the reciprocals of the powerful numbers is a finite transcendental number.
*The reciprocals of the [[factorial#Series of reciprocals|factorials]] sum to the transcendental number [[e (mathematical constant)|e]].
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[square number]]s (the [[Basel problem]]) is the transcendental number {{sfrac|{{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|6}}, or ζ(2) where ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]].
*The sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of positive integers is called [[Apéry's constant]], and equals approximately 1.2021. This number is irrational, but it is not known whether or not it is transcendental.
*The reciprocals of the non-negative integer [[powers of 2]] sum to 2.
*The [[Kempner series]] is the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers not containing the digit "9" in base 10. Unlike the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], which does not exclude those numbers, this series converges, specifically to approximately 22.9207.
*A [[palindromic number]] is one that remains the same when its digits are reversed. The sum of the reciprocals of the palindromic numbers converges to approximately 3.3703.
*A [[pentatope number]] is a number in the fifth cell of any row of [[Pascal's triangle]] starting with the 5-term row 1 4 6 4 1. The sum of the reciprocals of the pentatope numbers is 4/3.
*[[Sylvester's sequence]] is an [[integer sequence]] in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members, plus one. The first few terms of the sequence are 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807. The sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in Sylvester's sequence is 1.
*The [[Riemann zeta function]] ''ζ''(''s'') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a [[complex variable]] ''s'' that [[analytic continuation|analytically continues]] the sum of the infinite series  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}.&lt;/math&gt; It converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than 1.
*The sum of the reciprocals of all the [[Fermat number]]s (numbers of the form &lt;math&gt; 2^{(2^n)} + 1&lt;/math&gt;) {{OEIS|id=A051158}} is [[irrational number|irrational]].
*The sum of the reciprocals of the [[pronic number]]s (products of two consecutive integers) (excluding 0) is 1 (see [[Telescoping series]]).

===Divergent series===

*The ''n''-th partial sum of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], which is the sum of the reciprocals of the first ''n'' positive integers, diverges as ''n'' goes to infinity, albeit extremely slowly: the sum of the first 10&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; terms is less than 100. The difference between the cumulative sum and the [[natural logarithm]] of ''n''  converges to the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], commonly denoted as &lt;math&gt;\gamma ,&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately 0.5772.
*The [[Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes|sum of the reciprocals of the primes]] diverges.
*The strong form of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] implies that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes of the form 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 is divergent.
*The [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions]]  states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set ''A'' of positive integers diverges, then ''A'' contains [[arithmetic progression]]s of any length, however great.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">'''Market share liability''' is a [[legal doctrine]] that allows a plaintiff to establish a [[prima facie]] case against a group of product manufacturers for an injury caused by a product, even when the plaintiff does not know from which defendant the product originated. The doctrine is unique to the [[law of the United States]] and apportions [[legal liability|liability]] among the manufacturers according to their share of the market for the product giving rise to the plaintiff's injury.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition."  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Market share liability was introduced in the California case ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]''.  In ''Sindell'', the plaintiffs were injured by [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]], a drug prescribed to prevent [[miscarriage]]. The mothers of the plaintiffs had taken DES while pregnant, and expert testimony showed this to be a [[proximate cause]] of reproductive tract cancers in the plaintiffs years later. The plaintiffs, however, could not ascertain which drug company distributed the DES taken by their mothers. The court responded by allowing the plaintiffs to apportion liability among the defendant drug companies according to their respective shares in the DES market.

==Requirements==
''Sindell'' laid out the requirements for applying the doctrine of market share liability:

First, the defendants in court must constitute substantially all of the market. This is a distinguishing factor from [[alternative liability]] that requires that all of the defendants be in court (See [[Summers v. Tice]]). Having "substantially all" of the market makes it more likely that the actual wrongdoer will be in court. A main reason for not requiring all of the relevant market is that as time passes, some manufacturers drop out of the market, and it would raise the bar for the plaintiff too high. Also if all defendants were present, then market share liability would be unnecessary, because the plaintiff would be able to apply the doctrine of alternative liability to put the burden of proving causation onto the defendants.

Second, the products must be [[fungible]] (i.e. interchangeable—they must be of the same composition). For example, in ''[[Skipworth v. Lead Industries Association]]'', 690 A.2d 169 (Pa. 1997), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the [[lead paint]] the defendants sold to not be fungible because the paints had lead pigments containing different chemical formulations, different amounts of lead, and differed in potential toxicity.

Third, the defendants (potential tortfeasors) must all have been in the market within the specific timeframe surrounding the incident.

Fourth, the inability to point to a specific tortfeasor must not be the plaintiff's fault. This is particularly relevant in the pharmaceuticals context, as most plaintiffs are prescribed generic drugs and thus have no knowledge of who manufactured the product.

==Exculpatory evidence==
Jurisdictions and courts differ on the possibilities open to defendants to absolve themselves of market share liability. In ''Sindell'' (California), the court allowed defendants to bring forth exculpatory evidence and thus free themselves of liability. However, in ''[[Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.]]'' (New York), the court refused to allow exculpatory evidence because it felt that doing so would undermine the theory underpinning market share liability—because liability is based on relevant market share, providing exculpatory evidence will not reduce a defendant's overall share of the market.

==Subsequent cases==
''Sindell'' required plaintiffs to join defendant drug companies in a single action. A Wisconsin court took a different approach on this issue in ''[[Collins v. Eli Lilly Co.]]''  In ''Collins'', the court found that the plaintiff could bring a cause of action against a single defendant, and the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] would be shifted to the defendant to show that they did not produce the DES taken by the plaintiff's mother.&lt;ref name="Henderson-p126"&gt;Henderson, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to expand the market share approach beyond DES cases have been mostly rejected because the strict requirements of applying market share liability. Courts have declined to expand the market-share approach to [[asbestos]] (''[[Becker v. Baron Bros.]]''), handguns (''[[Hamilton v. Beretta]]''), and lead paint (''[[Santiago v. Sherwin Williams Co.]]''). The market-share approach has been expanded to cases involving [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]] in the New York case ''In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether''.&lt;ref name="Henderson-p126"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilberti, Frank J. ''Emerging Trends for Products Liability: Market Share Liability, Its History and Future'', 15 Touro L. Rev. 719 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A., Twerski, A.D. ''Products Liability: Problems and Process,'' 131-136 (5th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram (NSD)''' in computer programming is a [[Visual modeling|graphical design]] representation for [[structured programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Fill (2009). ''Visualisation for Semantic Information Systems''. p.32&lt;/ref&gt; This type of [[diagram]] was developed in 1972 by [[Isaac Nassi]] and [[Ben Shneiderman]] who were both graduate students at SUNY-Stony Brook.&lt;ref&gt;''A short history of structured flowcharts (Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams)''. Webdoc draft: May 27, 2003. ([http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/bshneiderman/nsd/ Source])&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams are also called '''structograms''',&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Isermann (1988). ''Automatic Control: Selected papers from the triennial world congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control : Munich, Federal Republic of Germany, 27–31 July 1987, Volume 10;Volume 14''. p.89&lt;/ref&gt; as they show a program's structures.

== Overview ==
Following a [[top-down design]], the problem at hand is reduced into smaller and smaller subproblems, until only simple statements and [[control flow]] constructs remain. Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams reflect this top-down decomposition in a straightforward way, using nested boxes to represent subproblems. Consistent with the philosophy of structured programming, Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams have no representation for a [[GOTO]] statement.

Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams are only rarely used for formal programming. Their abstraction level is close to structured program code and modifications require the whole diagram to be redrawn. Nonetheless, they can be useful for sketching processes and high-level designs.

Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams are almost [[isomorphic]] with [[flowchart]]s.  Everything that can be represented with a Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram can also be represented with a flowchart.  For flowcharts of programs, almost everything that can be represent with a flowchart can also be represented with a Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagram.  The exceptions are constructs like [[goto]] and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] ''break'' and ''continue'' statements for loops.

In Germany, Nassi&amp;ndash;Shneiderman diagrams were standardised in 1985 as DIN 66261.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Institut für Normung e. V. (DIN): [http://www.nia.din.de/cmd?artid=1255956&amp;bcrumblevel=1&amp;contextid=nia&amp;subcommitteeid=54755362&amp;level=tpl-art-detailansicht&amp;committeeid=54738935&amp;languageid=de DIN 66261: Informationsverarbeitung; Sinnbilder für Struktogramme nach Nassi-Shneiderman].&lt;/ref&gt; They are still used in German introductions to programming, for example Böttcher and Kneißl's introduction to C,&lt;ref&gt;Böttcher, Axel; Kneißl, Franz: ''Informatik für Ingenieure: Grundlagen und Programmierung in C''. 3rd edition. München: Oldenbourg, 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-486-70527-0}}.

'''Process blocks:''' the process block represents the simplest of steps and requires no analysis. When a process block is encountered the action inside the block is performed and we move onto the next block.

[[Image:Process Block2.jpg|thumb|center|Process blocks]]

'''Branching blocks:''' there are two types of branching blocks. First is the simple True/False or Yes/No branching block which offers the program two paths to take depending on whether or not a condition has been fulfilled. These blocks can be used as a looping procedure stopping the program from continuing until a condition has been fulfilled.

[[Image:Two-Way Branch.jpg|thumb|centre|True/False branching blocks]]

The second type of branching block is a multiple branching block. This block is used when a select case is needed in a program. The block usually contains a question or select case. The block provides the program with an array of choices and is often used in conjunction with sub process blocks to save space.

[[Image:Multiple Branching.jpg|thumb|centre|Multiple branching blocks]]

'''Testing loops:''' this block allows the program to loop one or a set of processes until a particular condition is fulfilled. The process blocks covered by each loop are subset with a side-bar extending out from the condition.

There are two main types of testing loops, test first and test last blocks. The only difference between the two is the order in which the steps involved are completed.
In the test first situation, when the program encounters the block it tests to see if the condition is fulfilled, then, if it is not completes the process blocks and then loops back. The test is performed again and, if the condition is still unfulfilled, it processes again. If at any stage the condition is fulfilled the program skips the process blocks and continues onto the next block.

[[Image:Test First.jpg|thumb|centre|Test first loop block]]

The test last block is simply reversed, the process blocks are completed before the test is performed. The test last loop allows for the process blocks to be performed at least once before the first test.

[[Image:Test Last.jpg|thumb|centre|Test last loop block]]

'''Concurrent''' execution can be drawn like this:

The '''Noble Eightfold Path''' ([[Pali]]: {{lang|pi|{{IAST|ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo}}}}; [[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|{{IAST|āryāṣṭāṅgamārga}}}})&lt;ref&gt;Brekke, Torkel. "The Religious Motivation of the Early Buddhists." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 67, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; is an early summary of the path of Buddhist practices leading to [[Moksha|liberation]] from [[samsara]], the painful cycle of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=81-83}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}

The Eightfold Path consists of eight practices: right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right ''[[samadhi]]'' ('meditative absorption or union').{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=11-14}} In early Buddhism, these practices started with understanding that the body-mind works in a corrupted way (right view), followed by entering the Buddhist path of self-observance, self-restraint, and cultivating kindness and compassion; and culminating in ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' or ''samadhi'', which re-inforces these practices for the development of the body-mind.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Gethin|1992}}{{sfn|Gethin|2004}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} In later Buddhism, insight (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]'') became the central soteriological instrument, leading to a different concept and structure of the path,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} in which the "goal" of the Buddhist path came to be specified as ending ignorance and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|p=253–255}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=1-13}}{{Sfn|Paul Williams|Anthony Tribe|Alexander Wynne|2012|p=52}}

The Noble Eightfold Path is one of the principal [[Dharma (Buddhism)|teachings]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]], taught to lead to ''[[Arhatship]]''.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Univ. Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Peter|title=An introduction to Buddhist ethics : foundations, values and issues|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-55394-6|pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theravada tradition, this path is also summarized as ''[[sila (Buddhism)|sila]]'' (morality), ''samadhi'' (meditation) and ''prajna'' (insight). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, this path is contrasted with the [[Bodhisattva]] path, which is believed to go beyond ''Arahatship'' to full [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Univ. Press" /&gt;

In Buddhist symbolism, the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the [[dharma wheel]] (dharmachakra), in which its eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
The Pali term ''{{IAST|ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo}}'' ({{lang-sa|arya astanga marga|script=Latn}}) is typically translated in English as "Noble Eightfold Path". This translation is a convention started by the early translators of Buddhist texts into English, just like ''ariya sacca'' is translated as [[Four Noble Truths]].{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=66}} However, the phrase does not mean the path is noble, rather that the path is {{em|of the noble people}} ({{lang-pi|arya|script=Latn}} meaning 'enlightened, noble, precious people').{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}} The term ''maggo'' (Sanskrit: ''marga'') means "path", while ''aṭṭhaṅgiko'' means "eightfold". Thus, an alternate rendering of ''ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo'' is "eightfold path of the noble ones",{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}{{Sfn| Buswell|2004|p=296}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche |title=Everyday Consciousness and Primordial Awareness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0FCCNiVsA8C |year=2007|publisher=Snow Lion |isbn=978-1-55939-973-9 |pages=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "eightfold Aryan Path".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mkhas-grub Dge-legs-dpal-bzaṅ-po|author2=José Ignacio Cabezón |title=A Dose of Emptiness: An Annotated Translation of the sTong thun chen mo of mKhas grub dGe legs dpal bzang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KqnpqRajPEC |year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0729-5 |pages=214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chögyam Trungpa |title=The Heart of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdCjGgmMJcoC  |year=2010|publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-0-8348-2125-5 |pages=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All eight elements of the Path begin with the word ''samyañc'' (in Sanskrit) or ''sammā'' (in Pāli) which means "right, proper, as it ought to be, best".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=695–696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist texts contrast ''samma'' with its opposite ''miccha''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695" /&gt;

== The Eightfold Path ==
=== Origin ===
{{See also|Buddhist paths to awakening}}

According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term ''the middle way''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Tilmann Vetter and historian Rod Bucknell both note that longer descriptions of "the path" can be found in the early texts, which can be condensed into the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}{{refn|group=note|One of those longer sequences, from the ''CulaHatthipadopama-sutta'', the "Lesser Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprints", is as follows:{{sfn|Bucknell|1984|p=11-12}}
# ''Dhammalsaddhalpabbajja'': A layman hears a Buddha teach the Dhamma, comes to have faith in him, and decides to take ordination as a monk;
# ''sila'': He adopts the moral precepts;
# ''indriyasamvara'': He practises "guarding the six sense-doors";
# ''sati-sampajanna'': He practises mindfulness and self-possession (actually described as mindfulness of the body, kāyānussatti);
# ''jhana 1'': He finds an isolated spot in which to meditate, purifies his mind of the hindrances (nwarana), and attains the first rupa-jhana;
# ''jhana 2'': He attains the second jhana;
# ''jhana 3'': He attains the third jhana;
# ''jhana 4'': He attains the fourth jhana;
# ''pubbenivasanussati-nana'': he recollects his many former existences in samsara;
# ''sattanam cutupapata-nana'': he observes the death and rebirth of beings according to their karmas;
# ''dsavakkhaya-nana'': He brings about the destruction of the dsavas (cankers), and attains a profound realization of (as opposed to mere knowledge about) the four noble truths;
# ''vimutti'': He perceives that he is now liberated, that he has done what was to be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A similar sequence can be found in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala-sutta]].&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"/&gt;}}

=== The Eight Divisions ===
The eight Buddhist practices in the Noble Eightfold Path are:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}{{refn|group=note|See also Majjhima Nikaya 44, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html Culavedalla Sutta]}}
# Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld/hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Wei-hsün Fu|Wawrytko|1994|p=194}}&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;Victor Gunasekara, ''[http://www.vgweb.org/bsq/payasi.htm The Pāyāsi Sutta: A Commentary and Analysis]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Quotes:&lt;br&gt;* Vetter: "Compare AN 10.17.10 (Nal. ed. IV p. 320,26): "He has the right views (sammiiditthiko hotz), he does not see things in a wrong way: that which is given exists, that which is sacrificed exists, that which in poured (into the fire) exists, the fruit, i.e. retribution for good and evil actions, exists, the world, here, exists, the other world exists, the mother exists, the father exists, beings who appear (spontaneously) exist, in the world ascetics and brahmans exist who have gone and followed the right path and who describe this world and the other world from their own experience and realization."&lt;br&gt;* Wei-hsün Fu and Wawrytko: "In the Theravada Buddhist Canon, many episodes appear where the Buddha emphasizes that accepting the reality of an afterlife is a part of having the Right View, the initial wisdom that one must have in pursuit of [...]"{{sfn|Wei-hsün Fu|Wawrytko|1994|p=194}}}} Later on, right view came to explicitly include ''[[karma]]'' and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist [[soteriology]].{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}
# Right Resolve or Intention: the giving up home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}} Such an environment aids contemplation of [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|suffering]], and [[anatta|non-Self]].{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right Speech: no lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Conduct or Action: no killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual acts, no material desires.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Livelihood: beg to feed, only possessing what is essential to sustain life;{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Effort: preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and generating [[seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]], the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'' (seven factors of awakening). This includes ''indriya-samvara'', "guarding the sense-doors," restraint of the sense faculties.&lt;ref name="Analayo2013"/&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right Mindfulness (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''; ''[[Satipatthana]]''; ''[[Sampajañña]]''): "retention," being mindful of the ''dhammas'' ("teachings," "elements") that are beneficial to the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942-943}}{{refn|group=note|According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects; this may have been the Buddha’s original idea;{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=45}} compare [[Buddhadasa]], ''Heartwood of the Bodhi-tree'', on [[Pratītyasamutpāda]]; and Grzegorz Polak (2011), ''Reexamining Jhana: Towards a Critical Reconstruction of Early Buddhist Soteriology'', p.153-156, 196-197.}} In the [[vipassana movement]], ''sati'' is interpreted as "bare attention": never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing;{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=941}} this encourages the awareness of the impermanence of body, feeling and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (''[[skandha]]s''), the [[five hindrances]], the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right ''[[samadhi]]'' (''[[Passaddhi]]''; ''[[Ekaggata]]''; ''sampasadana''): practicing four stages of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' ("meditation"), which includes ''samadhi'' proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'', culminating into ''[[upekkha]]'' (equanimity) and mindfulness.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}. In the Theravada tradition and the Vipassana movement, this is interpreted as ''[[ekaggata]]'', concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with ''[[Vipassana]]''-meditation, which aims at insight.

=== Liberation ===
Following the Noble Eightfold Path leads to [[Moksha|liberation]] in the form of [[nirvana]]:{{Sfn|Lopez|2009|p=136-137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J. Laumakis|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_29ZDAcUEwYC&amp;pg=PA150|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46966-1|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|(...) Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

The Noble Eightfold Path is sometimes divided into [[Three disciplines of Buddhism|three basic divisions]], as follows:{{sfn|Prebish|2000|p=40}}

This order is a later development, when discriminating insight (''prajna'') became central to Buddhist soteriology, and came to be regarded as the culmination of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}} Yet, Majjhima Nikaya 117, ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'', describes the first seven practices as requisites for right samadhi. According to Vetter, this may have been the original soteriological practice in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

"[[Buddhist ethics|Moral virtues]]" (Sanskrit: ''[[śīla]]'', Pāli: ''sīla'') group consists of three paths: right speech, right action and right livelihood.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}} The word ''śīla'' though translated by English writers as linked to "morals or ethics", states Bhikkhu Bodhi, is in ancient and medieval Buddhist commentary tradition closer to the concept of discipline and disposition that "leads to harmony at several levels&amp;nbsp;– social, psychological, karmic and contemplative".{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}} Such harmony creates an environment to pursue the meditative steps in the Noble Eightfold Path by reducing social disorder, preventing inner conflict that result from transgressions, favoring future karma-triggered movement through better rebirths, and purifying the mind.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}}{{Sfn|Spiro|1982|p=44-48}}

The meditation group ("samadhi") of the path progresses from moral restraints to training the mind.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=65}}{{Sfn|Spiro|1982|p=44-53}} Right effort and mindfulness calm the mind-body complex, releasing unwholesome states and habitual patterns and encouraging the development of wholesome states and non-automatic responses, the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'' (seven factors of awakening). The practice of ''dhyana'' reinforces these developments, leading to ''[[upekkha]]'' (equanimity) and mindfulness.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} According to the Theravada commentarial tradition and the contemporary Vipassana movement, the goal in this group of the Noble Eightfold Path is to develop clarity and insight into the nature of reality&amp;nbsp;– ''[[dukkha]]'', ''[[anicca]]'' and ''[[anatta]]'', discard negative states and dispel ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance), ultimately attaining ''[[nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name=trainor2004p74&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the threefold division, ''prajna'' (insight, wisdom) is presented as the culmination of the path, whereas in the eightfold division the path starts with correct knowledge or insight, which is needed to understand why this path should be followed.{{sfn|Anderson|2013}}

=== Tenfold Path ===
In the ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta''&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_028.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 2, No. 99, Sutra 785|accessdate=28 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923211023/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_028.htm|archive-date=23 September 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appears in the Chinese and Pali canons, the Buddha explains that cultivation of the noble eightfold path of a learner leads to the development of two further paths of the Arahants, which are right knowledge, or insight (''sammā-ñāṇa''), and right liberation, or release (''sammā-vimutti'').{{Sfn|Choong|2000|p=141}} These two factors fall under the category of wisdom (''paññā'').{{Sfn|Fuller|2005|p=55-56}}

The Noble Eightfold Path, in the Buddhist traditions, is the direct means to nirvana and brings a release from the cycle of life and death in the realms of samsara.{{Sfn|Lopez|1995|p=159}}{{Sfn| Hirakawa|1990|p=41}}

== Further explanation ==
=== Right view ===
{{See also|View (Buddhism)}}
"Right view" (''{{IAST|samyak-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') or "right understanding"{{sfn|Gunaratana|2001|p=11}} explicates that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld or hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Wei-hsün Fu|Wawrytko|1994|p=194}}&lt;ref name="vgweb.org" /&gt; [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 117, ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'', a text from the [[Pāli Canon]], describes the first seven practices as requisites of right samadhi, starting with right view:
{{quote|Of those, right view is the forerunner [...] And what is the right view with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions? 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed.{{refn|group=note|Vetter translates it as "offering into the fire".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12 with footnote 4}}}} There are fruits, and results of good and bad actions. There is this world and the next world. There is mother and father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are contemplatives and brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves.' This is the right view with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions.&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12 with footnote 4}}}}

Later on, right view came to explicitly include ''[[karma]]'' and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}} This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

The purpose of right view is to clear one's path from confusion, misunderstanding, and deluded thinking. It is a means to gain right understanding of reality.&lt;ref name=Chryssides249&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Chryssides |author2=Margaret Wilkins |title=A Reader in New Religious Movements  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwP--c7OV4cC |year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-6167-4 |pages=248–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interpretation of some Buddhist movements, state Religion Studies scholar George Chryssides and author Margaret Wilkins, right view is non-view: as the enlightened become aware that nothing can be expressed in fixed conceptual terms and rigid, dogmatic clinging to concepts is discarded.&lt;ref name=Chryssides249 /&gt;

==== Theravada ====
Right View can be further subdivided, states translator Bhikkhu Bodhi, into mundane right view and superior or supramundane right view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html#ch2 |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering |accessdate=10 July 2010|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Fuller|2005|p=56}}
# Mundane right view, knowledge of the fruits of good behavior. Having this type of view will bring merit and will support the favourable rebirth of the sentient being in the realm of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]].
# Supramundane (world-transcending) right view, the understanding of karma and rebirth, as implicated in the [[Four Noble Truths]],  leading to awakening and liberation from rebirths and associated [[dukkha]] in the realms of samsara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikkhu Bodhi|title=In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFiGGao0GWoC|year=2005|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-996-9|pages=147, 446 with note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

According to Theravada Buddhism, mundane right view is a teaching that is suitable for lay followers, while supramundane right view, which requires a deeper understanding, is suitable for monastics. Mundane and supramundane right view involve accepting the following doctrines of Buddhism:{{sfn|Richard Gombrich|2009|p=27-28, 103-109}}{{Sfn|Keown|2000|p=59, 96-97}}
# [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]]: Every action of body, speech, and mind has [[karma|karmic]] results, and influences the kind of future rebirths and realms a being enters into.
# [[Three marks of existence]]: everything, whether physical or mental, is impermanent (''anicca''), a source of suffering (''dukkha''), and lacks a self (''anatta'').
# The [[Four Noble Truths]] are a means to gaining insights and ending ''dukkha''.

=== Right resolve ===
Right resolve (''samyak-saṃkalpa'' / ''sammā saṅkappa'') can also be known as "right thought", "right intention",  or "right aspiration". In this factor, the practitioner resolves to leave home, renounce the worldly life and dedicate himself to an ascetic pursuit.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}} In section III.248, the Majjhima Nikaya states,
{{quote|And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.&lt;ref name="Bsaccavi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like right view, this factor has two levels. At the mundane level, the resolve includes being harmless ([[ahimsa]]) and refraining from ill will (''avyabadha'') to any being, as this accrues karma and leads to rebirth.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}&lt;ref name=keownprebish333 /&gt; At the supramundane level, the factor includes a resolve to consider everything and everyone as impermanent, a source of suffering and without a Self.&lt;ref name=keownprebish333&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S. Prebish |title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-98588-1 |pages=333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right speech ===
Right speech (''samyag-vāc'' / ''sammā-vācā'') in most Buddhist texts is presented as four abstentions, such as in the Pali Canon thus:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter: This is called right speech.}}

Instead of the usual "abstention and refraining from wrong" terminology,{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}} a few texts such as the Samaññaphala Sutta and Kevata Sutta in ''Digha Nikaya'' explain this virtue in an active sense, after stating it in the form of an abstention.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta | publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Samaññaphala Sutta states that a part of a monk's virtue is that "he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world."&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt; Similarly, the virtue of abstaining from divisive speech is explained as delighting in creating concord.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt; The virtue of abstaining from abusive speech is explained in this Sutta to include affectionate and polite speech that is pleasing to people. The  virtue of abstaining from idle chatter is explained as speaking what is connected with the Dhamma goal of his liberation.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

In the ''Abhaya-raja-kumara Sutta'', the Buddha explains the virtue of right speech in different scenarios, based on its truth value, utility value and emotive content.{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=105}}&lt;ref name=abhayasutta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.058.than.html |title=Abhaya Sutta|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Tathāgata|Tathagata]]'', states Abhaya Sutta, never speaks anything that is unfactual or factual, untrue or true, disagreeable or agreeable, if that is unbeneficial and unconnected to his goals.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}} Further, adds Abhaya Sutta, the ''Tathagata'' speaks the factual, the true, if in case it is disagreeable and unendearing, only if it is beneficial to his goals, but with a sense of proper time.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}} Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the ''Tathagata'', only speaks with a sense of proper time even when what he speaks is the factual, the true, the agreeable, the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}}&lt;ref name="Ganeri2007p47"&gt;{{cite book|author=J Ganeri  |title=The Concealed Art of the Soul: Theories of Self and Practices of Truth in Indian Ethics and Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dITDAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920241-6|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha thus explains right speech in the Pali Canon, according to Ganeri, as never speaking something that is not beneficial; and, only speaking what is true and beneficial, "when the circumstances are right, whether they are welcome or not".&lt;ref name="Ganeri2007p47" /&gt;

=== Right action ===
Right action (''samyak-karmānta'' / ''sammā-kammanta'') is like right speech, expressed as abstentions but in terms of bodily action. In the Pali Canon, this path factor is stated as:
{{quote|And what is right action? Abstaining from killing, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from sexual misconduct. This is called right action.&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roderick Bucknell |author2=Chris Kang |title=The Meditative Way: Readings in the Theory and Practice of Buddhist Meditation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSaOAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-80408-3 |pages=12–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prohibition on killing precept in Buddhist scriptures applies to all living beings, states Christopher Gowans, not just human beings.&lt;ref name="Gowans2004p177"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Gowans |title=Philosophy of the Buddha: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbU4Hd5lro0C |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-46973-4 |pages=177–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhikkhu Bodhi agrees, clarifying that the more accurate rendering of the Pali canon is a prohibition on "taking life of any sentient being", which includes human beings, animals, birds, insects but excludes plants because they are not considered sentient beings.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=57-58}} Further, adds Bodhi, this precept refers to ''intentional'' killing, as well as any form of intentional harming or torturing any sentient being.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=57-58}} This moral virtue in early Buddhist texts, both in context of harm or killing of animals and human beings, is similar to ''ahimsa'' precepts found in the texts particularly of Jainism as well as of Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Purusottama Bilimoria|author2=Joseph Prabhu|author3=Renuka M. Sharma|title=Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g78Cw4xQmsMC |year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-3301-3 |pages=311–324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Arapura |editor=K.

The prohibition on stealing in the Pali Canon is an abstention from intentionally taking what is not voluntarily offered by the person to whom that property belongs.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=58-59}} This includes, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, taking by stealth, by force, by fraud or by deceit.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=59-60}} Both the intention and the act matters, as this precept is grounded on the impact on one's karma.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=59-60}}

The prohibition on sexual misconduct in the Noble Eightfold Path, states Tilmann Vetter, refers to "not performing sexual acts".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}} This virtue is more generically explained in the ''Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta'', which teaches that one must abstain from all sensual misconduct, including getting sexually involved with someone unmarried (anyone protected by parents or by guardians or by siblings), and someone married (protected by husband), and someone betrothed to another person, and female convicts  or by ''dhamma''.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=60-62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html |title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For monastics, the abstention from sensual misconduct means strict celibacy, states Christopher Gowans, while for lay Buddhists this prohibits adultery as well as other forms of sensual misconduct.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p440"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Gowans |editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_lmCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-119-14466-3|pages=440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Powell |title=Living Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XO-qSUMphgC |year=1989|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20410-2 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David L.

=== Right livelihood ===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva'') precept is mentioned in many early Buddhist texts, such as the ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'' in ''Majjhima Nikaya'' as follows:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;
{{quote|"And what is right livelihood? Right livelihood, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions; there is right livelihood that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.

"And what is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandons wrong livelihood and maintains his life with right livelihood. This is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions.

"And what is the right livelihood that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The abstaining, desisting, abstinence, avoidance of wrong livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. (...)}}

The early canonical texts state right livelihood as avoiding and abstaining from wrong livelihood. This virtue is further explained in Buddhist texts, states Vetter, as "living from begging, but not accepting everything and not possessing more than is strictly necessary".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}} For lay Buddhists, states Harvey, this precept requires that the livelihood avoid causing suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any way.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}

The Anguttara Nikaya III.208, states Harvey, asserts that the right livelihood does not trade in weapons, living beings, meat, alcoholic drink or poison.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}{{Sfn|Rahula|2007|p=53}} The same text, in section V.177, asserts that this applies to lay Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |pages=59 }}; Quote: These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison."&lt;/ref&gt; This has meant, states Harvey, that raising and trading cattle livestock for slaughter is a breach of "right livelihood" precept in the Buddhist tradition, and Buddhist countries lack the mass slaughter houses found in Western countries.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=273-274}}

=== Right effort ===
{{See also|Four Right Efforts|Viriya}}

Right effort (''samyag-vyāyāma'' / ''sammā-vāyāma'') is preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and the generation of [[Seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]]. This includes ''indriya-samvara'', "guarding the sense-doors," restraint of the sense faculties.&lt;ref name="Analayo2013"&gt;Analayo (2013), ''Satipatthana'', Windhorse Publications: "... sense-restraint, which in fact constitues an aspect of right effort."&lt;/ref&gt; Right effort presented in the Pali Canon, such as the ''Sacca-vibhanga Sutta'' as follows:&lt;ref name="BSac" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;
{{quote|And what is right effort?&lt;br /&gt;
Here the monk arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to prevent the arising of evil and unwholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.&lt;br /&gt;
He arouses his will... and strives to eliminate evil and unwholesome mental states that have already arisen. He arouses his will... and strives to generate wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.&lt;br /&gt;
He arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have already arisen, to keep them free of delusion, to develop, increase, cultivate, and perfect them.&lt;br /&gt;
This is called right effort.}}

The unwholesome states (''akusala'') are described in the Buddhist texts, as those relating to thoughts, emotions, intentions, and these include ''pancanivarana'' ([[five hindrances]])&amp;nbsp;– sensual thoughts, doubts about the path, restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=67-68}} Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual thoughts and ill will needing more right effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=69-75}} This is to be done by restraint of the sense faculties (''indriya-samvara''). Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=69-75}}

=== Right mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (Buddhism)}}
{{See also|Sampajañña|Dhamma vicaya|Satipatthana|Anapanasati|Satipatthana Sutta}}

In the [[vipassana movement]], mindfulness (''{{IAST|samyak-smṛti}}'' / ''sammā-sati'') is interpreted as "bare attention": never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=941}} Yet, originally it has the meaning of "retention," being mindfull of the ''dhammas'' ("teachings," "elements") that are beneficial to the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942-943}} According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner this may have been the Buddha's original idea.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=45}} According to Trainor, mindfulness aids one not to crave and cling to any transitory state or thing, by complete and constant awareness of phenomena as impermanent, suffering and without self.&lt;ref name=trainor2004p74 /&gt; 

The ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' describes the contemplation of [[Satipatthana|four domains]], namely body, feelings, mind and phenomena.{{refn|group=note|The formula is repeated in other sutras, for example the ''Sacca-vibhanga Sutta'' (MN 141): "And what is right mindfulness?&lt;br /&gt;Here the monk remains contemplating the body as body, resolute, aware and mindful, having put aside worldly desire and sadness;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating feelings as feelings;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating mental states as mental states;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating mental objects as mental objects, resolute, aware and mindful, having put aside worldly desire and sadness;&lt;br /&gt;This is called right mindfulness."&lt;ref name="BSac" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;}} The ''Satipatthana Sutta'' is regarded by the Vipassana movement as the quintessential text on Buddhist meditation, taking ques from it on "bare attention" and the contemplation on the observed phenomena as ''[[dukkha]]'', ''[[anatta]]'' and ''[[anicca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the ''jhanas'', describing how the ''samskharas'' are tranquilized:{{sfn|Polak|2011|p=153-156, 196-197}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (''cittānupassanā'');
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').{{refn|group=note|Note how ''kāyānupassanā'', ''vedanānupassanā'', and ''cittānupassanā'', resemble the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and the chain of causation as described in the middle part of [[Pratītyasamutpāda]]; while ''dhammānupassanā'' refers to mindfulness as retention, calling into mind the beneficial ''dhammas'' which are applied to analyse phenomena, and counter the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions.}}

[[Rupert Gethin]] notes that the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] interprets the ''Satipatthana Sutta'' as "describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation" for which ''samatha'' (calm) and ''jhāna'' are not necessary. Yet, in [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]], the establishment of mindfulness was placed before the practice of the ''jhanas'', and associated with the abandonment of the [[five hindrances]] and the entry into the first ''jhana''.&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "The sutta is often read today as describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation that bypasses calm ([[samatha]]) meditation and the four absorptions ([[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]), as outlined in the description of the Buddhist path found, for example, in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala-sutta]] [...] The earlier tradition, however, seems not to have always read it this way, associating accomplishment in the exercise of establishing mindfulness with abandoning of the [[five hindrances]] and the first absorption."&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"&gt;Gethin, Rupert, Sayings of the Buddha: New Translations from the Pali Nikayas (Oxford World's Classics), 2008, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''-scheme describes mindfulness also as appearing in the third and fourth ''dhyana'', after initial concentration of the mind.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second ''jhana'' denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth ''jhana'' one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to them.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}

=== Right Concentration ===
{{Main|Dhyāna in Buddhism}}

====''Samadhi''====
''[[Samadhi]]'' (''samyak-samādhi'' / ''sammā-samādhi'') is a common practice in Indian religions. The term ''samadhi'' derives from the root sam-a-dha, which means 'to collect' or 'bring together',{{source?|date=October 2018}} and thus it is often translated as 'concentration' or 'unification of mind'. In the early Buddhist texts, samadhi is also associated with the term "[[samatha]]" (calm abiding).{{source?|date=October 2018}} In the suttas, samadhi is defined as one-pointedness of mind (''Cittass'ekaggatā'').&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana (1995), The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhagosa]] defines samadhi as "the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object...the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered."&lt;ref&gt;Visudimagga 84-85; PP.85{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the right concentration factor is reaching a one-pointedness of mind and unifying all mental factors, but it is not the same as "a gourmet sitting down to a meal, or a soldier on the battlefield" who also experience one-pointed concentration.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=97-110}} The difference is that the latter have a one-pointed object in focus with complete awareness directed to that object&amp;nbsp;– the meal or the target, respectively. In contrast, right concentration meditative factor in Buddhism is a state of awareness without any object or subject, and ultimately unto nothingness and emptiness.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=97-110}}

====Practice====
Bronkhorst notes that neither the Four Noble Truths nor the Noble Eightfold Path discourse provide details of right ''samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-566-4 |pages=10–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation is to be found in the Canonical texts of Buddhism, in several ''Suttas'', such as the following in ''Saccavibhanga Sutta'':&lt;ref name=BSac /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;

{{quote|And what is right concentration?

[i] Here, the monk, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, enters and remains in the first ''jhana'' (level of concentration, Sanskrit: ''dhyāna''), in which there is applied and sustained thinking, together with joy and pleasure born of detachment;&lt;br /&gt;
[ii] And through the subsiding of applied and sustained thinking, with the gaining of inner stillness and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second ''jhana'', which is without applied and sustained thinking, and in which there are joy and pleasure born of concentration;&lt;br /&gt;
[iii] And through the fading of joy, he remains equanimous, mindful and aware, and he experiences in his body the pleasure of which the Noble Ones say: "equanimous, mindful and dwelling in pleasure", and thus he enters and remains in the third ''jhana'';&lt;br /&gt;
[iv] And through the giving up of pleasure and pain, and through the previous disappearance of happiness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth ''jhana'', which is without pleasure and pain, and in which there is pure equanimity and mindfulness.&lt;br /&gt;
This is called right concentration.&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2009p16"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-566-4 |pages=16–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bronkhorst has questioned the historicity and chronology of the description of the four ''jhanas''. Bronkhorst states that this path may be similar to what the Buddha taught, but the details and the form of the description of the ''jhanas'' in particular, and possibly other factors, is likely the work of later scholasticism.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-566-4 |pages=17–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Freiberger |title=Asceticism and Its Critics: Historical Accounts and Comparative Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2cbCr7M4SJ8C |year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971901-3|pages=249–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronkhorst notes that description of the third ''jhana'' cannot have been formulated by the Buddha, since it includes the phrase "Noble Ones say", quoting earlier Buddhists, indicating it was formulated by later Buddists.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17 /&gt; It is likely that later Buddhist scholars incorporated this, then attributed the details and the path, particularly the insights at the time of liberation, to have been discovered by the Buddha.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17 /&gt;

====Mindfulness====
Although often translated as "concentration," as in the limiting of the attention of the mind on one object, in the fourth ''dhyana'' "equanimity and mindfulness remain,"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=63}} and the practice of concentration-meditation may well have been incorporated from non-Buddhist traditions.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|p=53-70}} Vetter notes that ''samadhi'' consists of the four stages of dhyana meditation, but
{{quote|...to put it more accurately, the first dhyana seems to provide, after some time, a state of strong concentration, from which the other stages come forth; the second stage is called samadhija.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}}}

Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second ''jhana'' denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth ''jhana'' one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}

== Practice ==
=== Order of practice ===
Vetter notes that originally the path culminated in the practice of ''dhyana/samadhi'' as the core soteriological practice.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} According to the Pali and Chinese canon, the ''samadhi'' state (right concentration) is dependent on the development of preceding path factors:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbeta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=28 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taisho Tripitaka Vol Page 814"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=28 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Blessed One said: "Now what, monks, is noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions? Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors&amp;nbsp;— right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness&amp;nbsp;— is called noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions.|Maha-cattarisaka Sutta}}

According to the discourses, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness are used as the support and requisite conditions for the practice of right concentration. Understanding of the right view is the preliminary role, and is also the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;ref name="BMaha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html |title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cbeta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_049.htm|title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 189 (中阿含雙品 聖道經第三)|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122083750/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_049.htm|archive-date=22 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the modern Theravada ''bhikkhu'' ([[Bhikkhu|monk]]) and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]], the divisions of the noble eightfold path "are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula 46&lt;/ref&gt; Bhikkhu Bodhi explains that these factors are not sequential, but components, and "with a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage in the Path where there is no more learning in [[Yogachara]] Abhidharma, state Buswell and Gimello, is identical to ''[[Nirvana]]'' or ''[[Buddhahood]]'', the ultimate goal in Buddhism.{{Sfn|Buswell|Gimello|1994|p=204}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rinpoche Karma-raṅ-byuṅ-kun-khyab-phrin-las|title=The Dharma: That Illuminates All Beings Impartially Like the Light of the Sun and Moon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4wVW91BLAYC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-156-1|pages=32–33}}; Quote: "There are various ways of examining the Complete Path. For example, we can speak of Five Paths constituting its different levels: the Path of Accumulation, the Path of Application, the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation and the Path of No More Learning, or Buddhahood."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
According to Bernard Faure, the ancient and medieval Buddhist texts and traditions, like other religions, were almost always unfavorable or discriminatory against women, in terms of their ability to pursue Noble Eightfold Path, attain Buddhahood and nirvana.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=53–54, 67–70, 78–81, 99–106, }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwilym Beckerlegge| title=The World Religions Reader| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52E9VaEATXcC |year=2001| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-0-415-24749-8|pages=365–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue of presumptions about the "female religious experience" is found in Indian texts, in translations into non-Indian languages, and in regional non-Indian commentaries written in East Asian kingdoms such as those in China, Japan and southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt; Yet, like other Indian religions, exceptions and veneration of females is found in Indian Buddhist texts, and female Buddhist deities are likewise described in positive terms and with reverence. Nevertheless, females are seen as polluted with menstruation, sexual intercourse, death and childbirth. Rebirth as a woman is seen in the Buddhist texts as a result of part of past karma, and inferior than that of a man.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt;

In some Chinese and Japanese Buddhist texts, the status of female deities are not presented positively, unlike the Indian tradition, states Faure.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt; In the Huangshinu dui Jingang (''Woman Huang explicates the Diamond Sutra''), a woman admonishes her husband about he slaughtering animals, who attacks her gender and her past karma, implying that "women go to hell" not because of her intentions nor actions (kamma), but simply because of the biology of her gender and the bodily functions over which she has no choice.&lt;ref name="Cole1994p203" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wm.

The ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' similarly presents the story of the [[Longnü|Dragon King's daughter]], who desires to achieve perfect enlightenment. The Sutra states that, "Her female organs vanished, the male organs became visible, then she appeared as a bodhisattva".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=99–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination worsened during the medieval era in various sub-traditions of Buddhism that independently developed regionally, such as in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=112–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as Kenneth Doo Young Lee, interpret the ''Lotus Sutra'' to imply that "women were capable of gaining salvation", either after they first turned into a man, or being reborn in Pure Land realm after following the Path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Kenneth Doo Young Lee|title=Prince and the Monk, The: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Xnk04cEGIC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-8046-5 |pages=93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Harvey lists many ''Sutras'' that suggest "having faded out the mind-set of a woman and developed the mind-set of a man, he was born in his present male form", and who then proceeds to follow the Path and became an Arahant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55640-8 |pages=368–370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Mahayana texts, there is a sutra dedicated to the concept of how a person might be born as a woman. The traditional assertion is that women are more prone to harboring feelings of greed, hatred and delusion than a man. The Buddha responds to this assumption by teaching the method of moral development through which a woman can achieve rebirth as a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|pages=371–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wei-Yi Cheng, the Pali Canon is silent about women's inferior karma, but have statements and stories that mention the Eightfold Path while advocating female subordination.&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Yi Cheng |title=Buddhist Nuns in Taiwan and Sri Lanka: A Critique of the Feminist Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwXDitVJ9t0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2007|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-16811-8|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a goddess reborn in the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|heavenly realm]] asserts:
{{Quote|
When I was born a human being among men I was a daughter-in-law in a wealthy family. I was without anger, obedient to my husband, diligent on the Observance (days). When I was born a human being, young and innocent, with a mind of faith, I delighted my lord. By day and by night I acted to please. Of old (...). On the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth (days) of the bright fortnight and on a special day of the fortnight well connected with the eightfold (precepts) I observed the Observance day with a mind of faith, was one who was faring according to Dhamma with zeal in my heart...
|''Vimanavatthu III.3.31''|Wei-Yi Cheng&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt;}}

Such examples, states Wei-Yi Cheng, include conflating statements about spiritual practice (Eightfold Path, Dhamma) and "obedience to my husband" and "by  day and by night I acted to please", thus implying unquestioned obedience of male authority and female subjugation.&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt; Such statements are not isolated, but common, such as in section II.13 of the ''Petavatthu'' which teaches that a woman had to "put away the thoughts of a woman" as she pursued the Path and this merit obtained her a better rebirth; the ''Jataka'' stories of the Pali Canon have numerous such stories, as do the Chinese Sutta that assert "undesirability of womanhood".&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt; Modern Buddhist nuns have applied Buddhist doctrines such as [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] to explain their disagreement with women's inferior karma in past lives as implied in ''Samyutta Nikaya 13'', states Wei-Yi Cheng, while asserting that the Path can be practiced by either gender and "both men and women can become arhant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Yi Cheng |title=Buddhist Nuns in Taiwan and Sri Lanka: A Critique of the Feminist Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwXDitVJ9t0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2007|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-16811-8|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive psychology ==
The noble eightfold path has been compared to cognitive psychology, wherein states Gil Fronsdal, the right view factor can be interpreted to mean how one's mind views the world, and how that leads to patterns of thought, intention and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n19J-wDlJlQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=q9W5uGhg1R&amp;dq=%C2%BBThe%20Dhammapada%3A%20A%20New%20Translation%20of%20the%20Buddhist%20Classic%20with%20Annotations&amp;pg=PT33 |title=The Dhammapada: A New Translation of the Buddhist Classic with Annotations |accessdate=14 July 2009|publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc. |last=Gil Fronsdal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Peter Randall states that it is the seventh factor or right mindfulness that may be thought in terms of cognitive psychology, wherein the change in thought and behavior are linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Randall |title=The Psychology of Feeling Sorry: The Weight of the Soul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iw5b4bbQkQC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-17026-3 |pages=206–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25702">The '''overconfidence effect''' is a well-established [[cognitive bias|bias]] in which a person's subjective ''confidence'' in his or her judgements is reliably greater than the objective ''accuracy'' of those judgements, especially when confidence is relatively high.&lt;ref name=Pallier2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallier|first1=Gerry|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Rebecca|last3=Danthiir|first3=Vanessa|last4=Kleitman|first4=Sabina|last5=Knezevic|first5=Goran|last6=Stankov|first6=Lazar|last7=Roberts|first7=Richard D.|title=The Role of Individual Differences in the Accuracy of Confidence Judgments|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=129|issue=3|year=2002|pages=257–299|doi=10.1080/00221300209602099|pmid=12224810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconfidence is one example of a miscalibration of [[subjective probability|subjective probabilities]]. Throughout the research literature, overconfidence has been defined in three distinct ways: (1) ''overestimation'' of one's actual performance; (2) ''overplacement'' of one's performance relative to others; and (3) ''overprecision'' in expressing unwarranted certainty in the accuracy of one's beliefs.&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Don A.|last2=Healy|first2=Paul J.|title=The trouble with overconfidence|journal=Psychological Review|volume=115|issue=2|year=2008|pages=502–517|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.2.502|pmid=18426301|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1340&amp;context=tepper|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106041057/http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1340&amp;context=tepper|archivedate=2014-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Don A.|last2=Schatz|first2=Derek|date=August 2017|title=The three faces of overconfidence|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/spc3.12331|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e12331|doi=10.1111/spc3.12331|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way in which overconfidence has been studied is by asking people how confident they are of specific beliefs they hold or answers they provide.  The data show that confidence systematically exceeds accuracy, implying people are more sure that they are correct than they deserve to be. If human confidence had perfect calibration, judgments with 100% confidence would be correct 100% of the time, 90% confidence correct 90% of the time, and so on for the other levels of confidence. By contrast, the key finding is that confidence exceeds accuracy so long as the subject is answering hard questions about an unfamiliar topic. For example, in a spelling task, subjects were correct about 80% of the time, whereas they claimed to be 100% certain.&lt;ref name=Adams1960&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=P. A.|last2=Adams|first2=J. K.|title=Confidence in the recognition and reproduction of words difficult to spell|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=1960|volume=73|pages=544–552|pmid=13681411|doi=10.2307/1419942|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, the error rate was 20% when subjects expected it to be 0%.  In a series where subjects made true-or-false responses to general knowledge statements, they were overconfident at all levels. When they were 100% certain of their answer to a question, they were wrong 20% of the time.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first= Sarah|first2=Baruch |last2=Fischhoff |first3=Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=1982| isbn=978-0-521-28414-1|pages=306–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overconfidence distinctions ==

=== Overestimation ===
One manifestation of the overconfidence effect is the tendency to overestimate one's standing on a dimension of judgment or performance. This subsection of overconfidence focuses on the certainty one feels in their own ability, performance, level of control, or chance of success. This phenomenon is most likely to occur on hard tasks, hard items, when failure is likely or when the individual making the estimate is not especially skilled. Overestimation has been seen to occur across domains other than those pertaining to one's own performance. This includes the ''[[illusion of control]]'', ''[[planning fallacy]]''.&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008" /&gt;

==== Illusion of control ====
Illusion of control describes the tendency for people to behave as if they might have some control when in fact they have none.&lt;ref name="Langer1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langer|first1=Ellen J.|title=The illusion of control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=2|year=1975|pages=311–328|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.2.311}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence does not support the notion that people systematically overestimate how much control they have; when they have a great deal of control, people tend to underestimate how much control they have.&lt;ref name="GinoSharek2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gino|first1=Francesca|last2=Sharek|first2=Zachariah|last3=Moore|first3=Don A.|title=Keeping the illusion of control under control: Ceilings, floors, and imperfect calibration|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=114|issue=2|year=2011|pages=104–114|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Planning fallacy ====
The [[planning fallacy]] describes the tendency for people to overestimate their rate of work or to underestimate how long it will take them to get things done.&lt;ref name="BuehlerGriffin1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buehler|first1=Roger|last2=Griffin|first2=Dale|last3=Ross|first3=Michael|title=Exploring the "planning fallacy": Why people underestimate their task completion times|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|year=1994|pages=366–381|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongest for long and complicated tasks, and disappears or reverses for simple tasks that are quick to complete.

==== Contrary evidence ====
Wishful-thinking effects, in which people overestimate the likelihood of an event because of its desirability, are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="KrizanWindschitl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krizan|first1=Zlatan|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|title=The influence of outcome desirability on optimism|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=133|issue=1|year=2007|pages=95–121|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.95|url=http://public.psych.iastate.edu/zkrizan/pdf/krizan_windschitl_06db.pdf|pmid=17201572|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217083929/http://public.psych.iastate.edu/zkrizan/pdf/krizan_windschitl_06db.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be in part because people engage in more [[defensive pessimism]] in advance of important outcomes,&lt;ref name="NoremCantor1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norem|first1=Julie K.|last2=Cantor|first2=Nancy|title=Defensive pessimism: Harnessing anxiety as motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=6|year=1986|pages=1208–1217|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1208|pmid=3806357}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to reduce the disappointment that follows overly optimistic predictions.&lt;ref name="McGrawMellers2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=A. Peter|last2=Mellers|first2=Barbara A.|last3=Ritov|first3=Ilana|title=The affective costs of overconfidence|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=17|issue=4|year=2004|pages=281–295|url=http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/pdf/mcgraw.mellers.ritov.2004.pdf|doi=10.1002/bdm.472|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083514/http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/pdf/mcgraw.mellers.ritov.2004.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overprecision ===
Overprecision is the excessive confidence that one knows the truth. For reviews, see Harvey (1997) or Hoffrage (2004).&lt;ref name="Harvey1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Nigel|title=Confidence in judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=1|issue=2|year=1997|pages=78–82|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(97)01014-0|pmid=21223868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter = Overconfidence|editor-first = Rüdiger |editor-last =Pohl|first = Ulrich|last = Hoffrage|title = Cognitive Illusions: a handbook on fallacies and biases in thinking, judgement and memory|publisher = Psychology Press|date = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84169-351-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the evidence for overprecision comes from studies in which participants are asked about their confidence that individual items are correct. This paradigm, while useful, cannot distinguish overestimation from overprecision; they are one and the same in these item-confidence judgments. After making a series of item-confidence judgments, if people try to estimate the number of items they got right, they do not tend to systematically overestimate their scores. The average of their item-confidence judgments exceeds the count of items they claim to have gotten right.&lt;ref name=Gigerenzer1993&gt;{{cite book|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1994-97037-011|last1=Gigerenzer|first1= Gerd|year=1993|chapter= The bounded rationality of probabilistic mental models|editor-first1= K. I.|editor-last1= Manktelow |editor-first2=D. E. |editor-last2=Over|title=Rationality: Psychological and philosophical perspectives |pages=127–171|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415069557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One possible explanation for this is that item-confidence judgments were inflated by overprecision, and that their judgments do not demonstrate systematic overestimation.

==== Confidence intervals ====
The strongest evidence of overprecision comes from studies in which participants are asked to indicate how precise their knowledge is by specifying a 90% confidence interval around estimates of specific quantities. If people were perfectly calibrated, their 90% confidence intervals would include the correct answer 90% of the time.&lt;ref name="AlpertRaiffa1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpert|first= Marc|first2=Howard |last2=Raiffa|chapter=A progress report on the training of probability assessors|editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases | publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=1982| isbn=978-0-521-28414-1|pages=294–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, hit rates are often as low as 50%, suggesting people have drawn their confidence intervals too narrowly, implying that they think their knowledge is more accurate than it actually is.

=== Overplacement ===
Overplacement is perhaps the most prominent manifestation of the overconfidence effect.  Overplacement is a judgment of your performance compared to another. This subsection of overconfidence occurs when people believe themselves to be better than others, or "better-than-average".&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008" /&gt; It is the act of placing yourself or rating yourself above others (superior to others). Overplacement more often occurs on simple tasks, ones we believe are easy to accomplish successfully. One explanation for this theory is its ability to self-enhance.

==== Manifestations ====

===== Better-than-average effects =====
{{main|Illusory superiority}}
Perhaps the most celebrated better-than-average finding is Svenson's (1981) finding that 93% of American drivers rate themselves as better than the median.&lt;ref name="Svenson1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svenson|first1=Ola|title=Are we all less risky and more skillful than our fellow drivers?|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=47|issue=2|year=1981|pages=143–148|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(81)90005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The frequency with which school systems claim their students outperform national averages has been dubbed the "Lake Wobegon" effect, after Garrison Keillor's apocryphal town in which "all the children are above average."&lt;ref name=Cannell1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cannell|first1=John Jacob|year=1989|title=How public educators cheat on standardized achievement tests: The "Lake Wobegon" report|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED314454|journal=Friends for Education|location=Albuquerque, NM|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107152116/http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED314454|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overplacement has likewise been documented in a wide variety of other circumstances.&lt;ref name="Dunning2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=David|title=Self-Insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAh2VRu4wGgC|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn= 978-1841690742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kruger (1999), however, showed that this effect is limited to "easy" tasks in which success is common or in which people feel competent. For difficult tasks, the effect reverses itself and people believe they are worse than others.&lt;ref name="Kruger1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|title=Lake Wobegon be gone! The "below-average effect" and the egocentric nature of comparative ability judgments|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=77|issue=2|year=1999|pages=221–232|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.2.221|pmid=10474208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Comparative-optimism effects =====
Some researchers have claimed that people think good things are more likely to happen to them than to others, whereas bad events were less likely to happen to them than to others.&lt;ref name="Weinstein1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinstein|first1=Neil D.|title=Unrealistic optimism about future life events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=5|year=1980|pages=806–820|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But others have pointed out that prior work tended to examine good outcomes that happened to be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that happened to be rare (such as being struck by lightning).&lt;ref name="ChambersWindschitl2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=John R.|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|title=Biases in Social Comparative Judgments: The Role of Nonmotivated Factors in Above-Average and Comparative-Optimism Effects|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=130|issue=5|year=2004|pages=813–838|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.813|pmid=15367082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChambersWindschitl2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=John R.|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|last3=Suls|first3=Jerry|title=Egocentrism, Event Frequency, and Comparative Optimism: When what Happens Frequently is "More Likely to Happen to Me"|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=29|issue=11|year=2003|pages=1343–1356|doi=10.1177/0146167203256870|pmid=15189574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrugerBurrus2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|last2=Burrus|first2=Jeremy|title=Egocentrism and focalism in unrealistic optimism (and pessimism)|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=3|year=2004|pages=332–340|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism.  People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely to happen to them than to others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely to happen to them than to others.

===== Positive illusions =====
{{Main|Positive illusions}}
Taylor and Brown (1988) have argued that people cling to overly positive beliefs about themselves, illusions of control, and beliefs in false superiority, because it helps them cope and thrive.&lt;ref name="TaylorBrown1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathon D.|title=Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=103|issue=2|year=1988|pages=193–210|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193|pmid=3283814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although there is some evidence that optimistic beliefs are correlated with better life outcomes, most of the research documenting such links is vulnerable to the alternative explanation that their forecasts are accurate.

This allowed confidence to be compared against accuracy. As the subjects were given more information about the case study, their confidence increased from 33% to 53%. However their accuracy did not significantly improve, staying under 30%. Hence this experiment demonstrated overconfidence which increased as the subjects had more information to base their judgment on.&lt;ref name="oskamp" /&gt;

Even if there is no general tendency toward overconfidence, social dynamics and [[adverse selection]] could conceivably promote it.  For instance, those most likely to have the courage to start a new business are those who most overplace their abilities relative to those of other potential entrants.  And if voters find confident leaders more credible, then contenders for leadership learn that they should express more confidence than their opponents in order to win election.&lt;ref name="RadzevickMoore2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radzevick |first1=J.

Overconfidence can be beneficial to individual [[self-esteem]] as well as giving an individual the [[Volition (psychology)|will]] to succeed in their desired goal.

{{emotion}}

'''Pleasure'''  is a broad class of mental states that [[humans]] and other [[animals]] experience as positive, enjoyable, or worth seeking. It includes more specific mental states such as [[happiness]], [[entertainment]], [[enjoyment]], [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]], and [[euphoria]]. The early [[psychology|psychological]] concept of pleasure, the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], describes it as a [[positive feedback]] mechanism that motivates the organism to recreate the situation it has just found pleasurable, and to avoid past situations that caused [[suffering|pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freud|first1=Siegmund|title=Beyond the pleasure principle|year=1950|publisher=Liveright|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of pleasure is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and different individuals experience different kinds and amounts of pleasure in the same situation. Many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives, such as [[eating]], [[exercise]], [[hygiene]], [[sleep]], and [[Human sexual activity|sex]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; The appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as [[art]], [[music]], [[dancing]], and [[literature]] is often pleasurable.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

Based upon the [[incentive salience]] model of [[reward system|reward]] – the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces approach behavior and consummatory behavior&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; – an intrinsic reward has two components: a "wanting" or desire component that is reflected in approach behavior, and a "liking" or pleasure component that is reflected in consummatory behavior.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; While all pleasurable stimuli are rewards, some rewards do not evoke pleasure.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Psychology===
Pleasure is considered one of the core dimensions of emotion. It can be described as the positive evaluation that forms the basis for several more elaborate evaluations such as "agreeable" or "nice". As such, pleasure is an [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and not an [[emotion]], as it forms one component of several different emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pleasures of the Brain|last = Frijda|first = Nico F.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = 99|chapter = On the Nature and Function of Pleasure|editor-last = Kringelbach|editor-first = Morten L.|editor-last2 = Berridge|first2 = |editor-first2 = Kent C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pleasure is sometimes subdivided into fundamental pleasures that are closely related to survival (food, sex, and social belonging) and higher-order pleasures (e.g., viewing art and altruism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Pleasure Center : Trust Your Animal Instincts: Trust Your Animal Instincts|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4vrnEQDiNXcC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|date = 2008-10-15|isbn = 9780199717392|language = en|first = Morten L.|last = Kringelbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical condition of being unable to experience pleasure from usually enjoyable activities is called [[anhedonia]]. An active aversion to obtaining pleasure is called [[hedonophobia]].

Pleasure is often regarded as a bipolar construct, meaning that the two ends of the spectrum from pleasant to unpleasant are mutually exclusive. This view is e.g. inherent in the circumplex model of affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal = Development and Psychopathology|date = 2005-09-01|issn = 1469-2198|pmc = 2367156|pmid = 16262989|pages = 715–734|volume = 17|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S0954579405050340|first = Jonathan|last = Posner|first2 = James A.|last2 = Russell|first3 = Bradley S.|last3 = Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, some lines of research suggest that people do experience pleasant and unpleasant feelings at the same time, giving rise to so-called mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pleasure, displeasure, and mixed feelings: Are semantic opposites mutually exclusive?|journal = Cognition and Emotion|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 0269-9931|pages = 81–97|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02699930126097|first = Ulrich|last = Schimmack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Response latencies of pleasure and displeasure ratings: Further evidence for mixed feelings|journal = Cognition and Emotion|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 0269-9931|pages = 671–691|volume = 19|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/02699930541000020|first = Ulrich|last = Schimmack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Are You Feeling?

The degree to which something or someone is experienced as pleasurable not only depends on its objective attributes (appearance, sound, taste, texture, etc.), but on beliefs about its history, about the circumstances of its creation, about its rarity, fame, or price, and on other non-intrinsic attributes, such as the social status or identity it conveys.  For example, a sweater that has been worn by a celebrity is more desired than an otherwise identical sweater that has not, though considerably less so if it has been washed.&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;Paul Bloom. ''How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like'' (2010) 280 pages. Draws on neuroscience, philosophy, child-development research, and behavioral economics in a study of our desires, attractions, and tastes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example was when Grammy-winning, internationally acclaimed violinist [[Joshua Bell]] played in the Washington D.C. subway for 43 minutes, attracting little attention from the 1,097 people who passed by, and earning about $59 in tips.&lt;ref name="bloom" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=9521098|title=A Concert Violinist on the Metro?|date=11 April 2007|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/pearls-before-breakfast-can-one-of-the-nations-great-musicians-cut-through-the-fog-of-a-dc-rush-hour-lets-find-out/2014/09/23/8a6d46da-4331-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html|title=Pearls Before Breakfast: Can one of the nation’s great musicians cut through the fog of a D.C. rush hour? Let’s find out.|work=Washington Post|author=Gene Weingarten|date=April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Bloom describes these phenomena as arising from a form of [[essentialism]].

==Philosophical views==
{{Hedonism}}
{{Utilitarianism}}
[[Epicurus]] and his followers defined the highest pleasure as the absence of [[suffering]]&lt;ref name="Epicurus1"&gt;[http://wiki.epicurus.info/Principal_Doctrines The Forty Principal Doctrines], Number III.&lt;/ref&gt; and pleasure itself as "freedom from pain in the body and freedom from turmoil in the soul".&lt;ref name="Epicurus2"&gt;[http://wiki.epicurus.info/Letter_to_Menoeceus Letter to Menoeceus], Section 131-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cicero]] (or rather his character Torquatus) Epicurus also believed that pleasure was the [[chief good]] and pain the chief evil.&lt;ref name="Epicurus3"&gt;[http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/De_Finibus.html#IX, About the Ends of Goods and Evils, Book I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209054419/http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/De_Finibus.html |date=2013-12-09 }}, From Section IX, Torquatus sets out his understanding of Epicurus's philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi|Razi]]'s "Treatise of the Self and the Spirit" (''Kitab al Nafs Wa’l Ruh'') analyzed different types of pleasure, [[Sense|sensuous]] and [[intellectual]], and explained their relations with one another. He concludes that human needs and desires are endless, and "their satisfaction is by definition impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [371]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] understood pleasure as a negative sensation, one that negates the usual existential condition of suffering.&lt;ref name="Schopenhauer"&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/counsels/chapter1.html Counsels and Maxims], Chapter 1, General Rules Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies of pleasure===
[[Utilitarianism]] and [[hedonism]] are philosophies that advocate increasing to the maximum the amount of pleasure and minimizing the amount of suffering.

==As a uniquely human experience==
{{see also|Reward system#Animals vs humans|Animal sexual behaviour#Sex for pleasure}}
In the past, there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind; however, it is now known that animals do experience pleasure, as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli.&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt;

[[File:Rebus escort card.jpg|thumb|A rebus-style "escort card" from around 1865, to be read as "May I see you home my dear?"]]
[[File:Arolsen Klebeband 18 041 3.JPG|thumb|A German rebus, circa 1620.]]

A '''rebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|b|ə|s}}) is a [[puzzle]] device which combines the use of illustrated pictures with individual letters to depict words and/or phrases. For example: the word ‘been’ might be depicted by a "rebus" showing an illustrated bumblebee next to a plus sign (+) and the letter "n". It was a favorite form of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] expression used in the [[Middle Ages]] to denote surnames.

For example, in its basic form, three [[salmon]] (fish) are used to denote the surname "[[Salmon (surname)|Salmon]]". A more sophisticated example was the rebus of Bishop [[Walter Hart|Walter Lyhart]] (d.1472) of Norwich, consisting of a [[stag]] (or [[Deer|hart]]) lying down in a conventional representation of water.

The composition alludes to the name, profession or personal characteristics of the bearer, and speaks to the beholder ''Non verbis, sed rebus'', which Latin expression signifies "not by words but by things"&lt;ref&gt;Boutell, Charles, Heraldry Historical &amp; Popular, London, 1863, pp.117–120&lt;/ref&gt; (''res, rei'' (f), a thing, object, matter; ''rebus'' being ablative plural).&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebuses within heraldry==
{{Further|Canting arms}}

Rebuses are used extensively as a form of heraldic expression as a hint to the name of the bearer; they are not synonymous with [[canting arms]]. A man might have a rebus as a personal identification device entirely separate from his armorials, canting or otherwise. For example, [[Richard Weston (treasurer)|Sir Richard Weston]] (d.1541) bore as arms: ''Ermine, on a chief azure five [[bezant]]s'', whilst his rebus, displayed many times in terracotta plaques on the walls of his mansion [[Sutton Place, Surrey]], was a "tun" or barrel, used to designate the last syllable of his surname.

An example of canting arms proper are those of the [[Congleton|Borough of Congleton]] in Cheshire consisting of a [[conger]] eel, a lion (in Latin, ''leo'') and a tun (barrel). This word sequence "conger-leo-tun" enunciates the town's name.
Similarly, the coat of arms of [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] contains wolves (in Spanish, ''lobo'') and a kettle (''olla''), said by some (probably incorrectly) to be a rebus for "Loyola". The arms of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] feature [[bow (weapon)|bows]] and lions.

==Modern rebuses, word plays==
[[File:Top Secret Rebus Puzzle.png|thumb|A rebus puzzle representing [[top secret]]]]
A modern example of the rebus used as a form of [[word play]] is:
:H + [[File:Earcov.JPG|30px|Ear]]  = ''Hear'', or ''Here''.
By extension, it also uses the positioning of words or parts of words in relation to each other to convey a hidden meaning, for example:
:p walk ark'': walk in the park.

A rebus made up solely of letters (such as "CU" for "See you") is known as a [[gramogram]], grammagram, or letteral word. This concept is sometimes extended to include numbers (as in "Q8" for "[[Kuwait]]", or "8" for "ate").&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptic crossword reference lists &gt; Gramograms|url=http://www.highlightpress.com.au/gramograms.html|publisher=Highlight Press|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Rebuses are sometimes used in crossword puzzles, with multiple letters or a symbol fitting into a single square.&lt;ref name="nyt-solve"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Solve The New York Times Crossword|publisher=New York Times|author=Deb Amlen|authorlink=Deb Amlen|accessdate=12 December 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictograms==

The term ''rebus'' also refers to the use of a [[pictogram]] to represent a syllabic sound. This adapts pictograms into [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]]. A precursor to the development of the alphabet, this process represents one of the most important developments of writing. Fully developed hieroglyphs read in rebus fashion were in use at Abydos in Egypt as early as 3400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86189-167-9}}, at page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of correspondence in rebus form became popular in the 18th century and continued into the 19th century. [[Lewis Carroll]] wrote the children he befriended picture-puzzle rebus letters, nonsense letters, and [[Mirror|looking-glass]] letters, which had to be held in front of a mirror to be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lewis Carroll Centenary Article |work=Niles Daily Star |date=3 January 1998 |author=Dawn Comer |url=http://www.lewiscarroll.org/centenary/niles.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513102004/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/centenary/niles.html |archive-date=13 May 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebus letters served either as a sort of [[code]] or simply as a [[pastime]].

==Rebus principle==
[[File:Ramesses II as child.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramesses II]] as child: Hieroglyphs: ''Ra-mes-su''. ]]

In [[linguistics]], the '''rebus principle''' is the use of existing symbols, such as pictograms, purely for their sounds regardless of their meaning, to represent new words. Many ancient writing systems used the rebus principle to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to represent with pictograms. An example that illustrates the Rebus principle is the representation of the sentence "I can see you" by using the pictographs of "eye—can—sea—ewe."

Some linguists believe that the Chinese developed their writing system according to the rebus principle,&lt;ref&gt;''The Languages of China''. S. Robert Ramsey. Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and Egyptian hieroglyphs sometimes used a similar system. A famous rebus statue of [[Ramses II]] uses three hieroglyphs to compose his name: [[Horus]] (as [[Ra]]), for ''Ra''; the child, ''mes''; and the sedge plant (stalk held in left hand), ''su''; the name Ra-mes-su is then formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50215544|title=The pharaohs|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|others=Ziegler, Christiane.|isbn=9780500051191|location=London|oclc=50215544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900) ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' London: Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; posited that the rebus was the basis for uncovering the latent content of the [[dream]].  He wrote, "A dream is a picture puzzle of this sort and our predecessors in the
field of dream interpretation have made the mistake of treating the rebus as a pictorial composition: and as such it has seemed to them
nonsensical and worthless."

==Use in game shows==
'''Canada'''
*1980s children's game show ''[[Kidstreet]]'' featured a rebus [[Kidstreet#Kidstreet Rebus|during the bonus round (or "final lap")]].

'''United Kingdom'''
*''[[Catchphrase (UK game show)|Catchphrase]]'' is a long-running game show which required contestants to decipher a rebus. The show began as a short-lived [[Catchphrase (U.S. game show)|American game show]] hosted by [[Art James]] before being seen in the United Kingdom from 1986 to 2004 and returning in 2013. There was also an [[Burgo's Catch Phrase|Australian version]] of the show hosted by [[John Burgess (host)|John Burgess]].
*In 1998, Granada TV produced ''[[Waffle (game show)|Waffle]]'', a single word rebus puzzle show that was hosted by Nick Weir, and included premium telephone line viewer participation.

'''United States'''
*Rebuses were central to the television game show ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].'' Contestants had to solve a rebus, usually partially concealed behind any of thirty "squares", to win a game.
*The [[HBO]] children's game series ''[[Crashbox]]'' features three rebus puzzles in the game segment "Ten Seconds."
*A short-lived ABC game show from 1965 known as ''The Rebus Game'' also involved contestants creating rebuses to communicate an answer.

'''India'''
*[[Dadagiri Unlimited]] is a game show, in which some rebus puzzles are used in the [[Dadagiri Unlimited#Overview|googly round]]. The show is broadcast by [[Zee Bangla]] and hosted by the famous Indian cricketer [[Sourav Ganguly#2008–present: International retirement and the Indian Premier League|Sourav Ganguly]].

==Historic examples==
[[File:Frederick-rebus.png|thumb|250px|A rebus sent to [[Voltaire]] by [[Frederick the Great]].]]
[[File:Owl-dom rebus.png|thumb|250px|Bishop [[Hugh Oldham|Oldham's]] owl-dom rebus as carved in the wall of his chantry in [[Exeter Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=Heraldry, Historical and Popular |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcEYAAAAMAAJ |edition=2nd |year=1863 |publisher=Winsor and Newton |location=London |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* It is reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |authorlink=Marcel Danesi |title=The Puzzle Instinct: The Meaning of Puzzles in Human Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47PHOZBdCLYC |edition=1st |year=2002 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana, USA |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; that when [[Voltaire]] was the guest of [[Frederick the Great]] at [[Sanssouci Palace]], they exchanged puzzle notes. Frederick sent over a page with two picture blocks on it: two hands below the letter P, and then the number 100 below a picture of a handsaw, all followed by a question mark. Voltaire replied with: '''Ga!'''

:Both messages were rebuses in the French language: ''deux mains sous Pé à cent sous scie?'' "two hands under 'p' at [one] hundred under saw" = ''demain souper à Sanssouci?'' "supper tomorrow at Sanssouci?"); reply: ''Gé grand, A petit!'' "big 'G', small 'a'!" (= ''j'ai grand appétit!'' "I am very hungry!").

* The early 16th-century [[Bishop of Exeter]], [[Hugh Oldham]] adopted the owl as his personal device. It bore a scroll in its beak bearing the letters D.O.M., forming a rebus based on his surname, which would probably have been pronounced at the time as ''owl-dom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/philanthropy1.html |title=Manchester Celebrities – Philanthropy, Philosophy &amp; Religion – Bishop Hugh Oldham |publisher=ManchesterUK |accessdate=2011-01-03 |last=Moss |first=John |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116153116/http://manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/philanthropy1.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 19th-century French sculptor [[Jean-Pierre Dantan]] would place rebuses on the [[Socle (architecture)|socles]] of his caricature busts to identify the subject. For example, [[Victor Hugo]] was an axe (''hache'' in French, which sounds like the French pronunciation of "H") + UG + crossed bones (''os'', sounding like "O"). [[Hector Berlioz]] was represented by the letters BER low on the socle, with a bed (''lit'', for "li") comparatively high on the socle (to mean "''haut''", the French for high, pronounced with a silent "h" and "t" and so sounding like "O").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearttribune.com/spip.php?page=docbig&amp;id_document=2120 The Art Tribune – ''Jean-Pierre Dantan (1800–1869), Louis-Hector Berlioz, 1833'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rebus Bibles such as ''[[A Curious Hieroglyphic Bible]]'' were popular in the late 18th century for teaching Bible-reading to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri014.html |title=A Curious Hieroglyphick Bible |work=American Treasures of the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=January 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009020545/http://loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri014.html |archivedate=9 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
[[File:Kuni rebus 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A rebus for the names of Japanese provinces, from around 1800.]]

{{see also|Japanese rebus monogram}}

In Japan, the rebus known as {{Nihongo||判じ物|hanjimono}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hepburn|first=James Curtis|publisher=A.D.F. Randolph|year=1873|title=A Japanese-English and English-Japanese Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8M9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt; was immensely popular during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Morris|editor-first=Ivan|editor-link=Ivan Morris|last=Ihara|first=Saikaku|author-link=Ihara Saikaku|title=The Life of an Amorous Woman: And Other Writings|publisher=A.D.F.

Today the most often seen of these symbols is a picture of a sickle, a circle, and the letter {{Nihongo||ぬ|nu}}, read as {{Nihongo||鎌輪ぬ|kama-wa-nu|sickle circle ''nu''}}, interpreted as {{Nihongo||構わぬ|kamawanu}}, the old-fashioned form of {{Nihongo||構わない|kamawanai|don't worry, doesn't matter}}. This is known as the {{Nihongo||鎌輪奴文|kamawanu-mon|kamawanu sign}}, and dates to circa 1700,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160525003448/http://www.weblio.jp/content]&lt;/ref&gt; being used in kabuki since circa 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817053914/https://kotobank.jp/word/|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabikaratabi.pro.tok2.com/cgi-bin/c-board.cgi?cmd=one;no=147;id=monnyoujitenn |title=旅から旅 文様事典 ＢＢＳ |publisher=Tabikaratabi.pro.tok2.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kabuki]] actors would wear ''yukata'' and other clothing whose pictorial design, in rebus, represented their [[Yagō]] "guild names", and would distribute [[tenugui]] cloth with their rebused names as well. The practice was not restricted to the acting profession and was undertaken by townsfolk of various walks of life. There were also pictorial calendars called  {{Interlanguage link multi|egoyomi|ja|vertical-align=sup}} that represented the [[Japanese calendar]] in rebus so it could be "read" by the illiterate.

Today a number of abstract examples following certain conventions are occasionally used for names, primarily for corporate [[logo]]s or product logos and incorporating some characters of the name, as in a [[monogram]]; see [[Japanese rebus monogram]]. The most familiar example globally is the logo for [[Yamasa]] soy sauce, which is a ∧ with a サ under it. This is read as ''Yama,'' for {{Nihongo||山|yama|mountain}} (symbolized by the ∧) + {{Nihongo||サ|sa|katakana character for ''sa''}}.

==In popular culture==

[[File:Silence and Respect.jpg|thumb|right|A sign entreating "silence and respect" at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]
'''Respect''' is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important, or held in high esteem or regard; it conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities; and it is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/respect|title=Definition of RESPECT|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/respect|title=Definition of "respect"|work=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect include simple words and phrases like "thank you" in the West, simple physical [[gesture]]s like a slight bow in the East, a smile, or direct eye contact, or a simple handshake.

== Signs and other ways of knowing respect ==

=== Language ===

Respect is shown in many different languages by following certain grammatical conventions, especially in referring to individuals.

An [[honorific]] is a word or expression (often a [[pronoun]]) that shows respect when used in addressing or referring to a person or animal.

Typically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific first person forms (like "your most humble servant" or "this unworthy person") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.

For instance, it is disrespectful to not use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific "san" can be used when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/features.html|title=Top Experiences in Tokyo - Fodor's Travel|website=www.fodors.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China it is rude to call someone by their first name unless you have known them for a long period of time. In work-related situations, people address each other by their title. At home people often refer to each other by nicknames or terms of kinship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;
[http://www.protocolprofessionals.com/articles_china.htm Protocol Professionals, Inc. | Chinese Etiquette &amp; Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Chinese culture, individuals often address their friends as juniors and seniors even if they are just a few months younger or older. When a Chinese person asks someone their age they often do this so they know how to address the person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Physical gestures ===
{{See also|Category:Gestures of respect}}

[[File: Westindischer Maler um 1530 001.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A wife touching the feet of her husband.]]

In Islamic cultures around the world, there are many ways to show respect to people. For example, it is recommended to kiss the hands of parents, grandparents and teachers. Also, it is narrated in the sayings of Muhammad that if a person looks at the faces of parents and teachers with a smile, he will definitely be rewarded by Allah with success and happiness.

In [[India]], it is customary that, out of respect, when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (considered to be a manifestations of [[Saraswati]], the goddess of knowledge) or another person's leg, it will be followed by an apology in the form of a single hand gesture ([[Pranāma]]) with the right hand, where the offending person first touches the object with the finger tips and then the forehead and/or chest. This also counts for money, which is considered to be a manifestation of the goddess of wealth [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;DeBruyn, Pippa; Bain, Keith; Venkatraman, Niloufer (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qG-9cwHOcCIC Frommer's India]''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranāma, or the touching of feet in Indian culture is a sign of respect. For instance, when a child is greeting his or her grandparent, they typically will touch their hands to their grandparents' feet. In Indian culture, it is believed that the feet are a source of power and love.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Gautam (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ0XQHEkuIcC Sacred Hindu Symbols]''. pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many African/West Indian descent communities and some non-African//West Indian descent communities, respect can be signified by the touching of fists.

Many gestures or physical acts that are common in the West can be considered disrespectful in Japan. For instance, one should not point directly at someone.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|title=Lodging Options - Experience Tokyo|date=31 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031054529/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When greeting someone or thanking them, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow lower than the person with higher status. The duration and level of the bow depends on many factors such as age and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/chap5.html|title=Cultural Variations In Body Language|website=westsidetoastmasters.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some signs of physical respect apply to women only. If a woman does not wear cosmetics or a brassiere, it is possible that she will be considered unprofessional or others may think she does not care about the situation.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"/&gt;

==== Chinese culture ====
{{See also|Category:Chinese honorifics}}

Unlike Japanese culture, it is not necessary in Chinese culture to bow to one another as a greeting or parting gesture. Bowing is generally reserved as a sign of respect for elders and ancestors. When bowing, they place the fist of the right hand in the palm of their left at stomach level. The deeper the bow, the more respect they are showing.

In Chinese culture, there is not much participation in physical contact, especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual, thus disrespectful. It is considered rude to slap, pat, or put one's arm around the shoulders of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commisceo-global.com/country-guides/china-guide|title=China - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|website=www.commisceo-global.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[affection]] in same-sex [[friendships]] in East Asia is much more pronounced than in the West. Same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another, holding hands, and other signs of physical affection.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, et al. "Communicating love: Comparisons between American and East Asian university students." ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations''. no. 32 (2008): 200-2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Chinese sometimes do not smile or exchange greetings with strangers. Smiling or being friendly to someone you do not know well can be considered rude and too familiar. It is also common to see Chinese women covering their mouths when they laugh. Traditionally, a woman who laughed too loudly was considered to be uncouth and ill-bred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Traditionally, there was not much hand-shaking in Chinese culture. However, this gesture is now widely practiced among men, especially when greeting Westerners or other foreigners. Many Westerners may find Chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak, but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Kowtowing]], or kneeling and bowing so deeply that one's forehead is touching the floor, is practiced during worship at temples. Kowtowing is a powerful gesture reserved mainly for honoring the dead or offering deep respect at a temple.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Many codes of behavior revolve around young people showing respect to older people. Like in many cultures, younger Chinese individuals are expected to defer to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. Sometimes when an older person enters a room, everyone stands. People are often introduced from oldest to youngest. Often time, younger people will go out of their way to open doors for their elders and not cross their legs in front of them. The older you are the more respect you are expected to be treated with.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Respect as a cultural value==
[[File:Respeitoplaca.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Sign]] in [[São João da Barra]] saying ''"respect if you want to be respected"''.]]

=== Indigenous American culture ===
In many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American societies]] the perspective on respect differs slightly because it serves as an important concept valued in their culture's context. Aside from meaning positive feelings of esteem or deference is also viewed as a moral value that teaches indigenous individuals about their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=David-Lorente|title=Ser respetuoso es ser persona. El niño y la pedagogía moral de Los Nahuas del Centro de México|journal=Revista de Dialectología y Tradiciones Populares|date=2012|volume=67|issue=2|pages=431|doi=10.3989/rdtp.2012.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this moral value is treated as a process that influences certain participation in the community and also helps the individual develop and become integrated into their culture's community. During childhood is when this value of respect is taught because indigenous children participating in and learning about their community is an important aspect of the culture.

Respect as a form of behavior and participation is especially important in childhood as it serves as a basis of how the child must conduct themselves in their community. Children engage in mature activities such as cooking for the family, cleaning and sweeping the house, caring for infant peers, and crop work. Indigenous children learn to view their participation in these activities are a representation of respect. Through his manner of participation of activities of respect is how children not only learn about culture but also practice it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=Official Guide to Government Information and Services  - USAGov|website=usa.gov|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respect for Authority (Christianity) ===

The Christian faith specifically recognizes respect for Authority throughout the Bible, including parental authority ([[Ten Commandments|Ten Commandments]]), civil authority and divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume33/GOT033159.html|title=Respect for Authority|website=truthmagazine.com|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zfhf9j6/revision/1 |title=Sources of Authority |newspaper=[[BBC]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First of all, then, I urge that entreaties ''and'' prayers, petitions ''and'' thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and &lt;sup&gt;[b]&lt;/sup&gt;dignity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">In [[combinatorics]], the '''rule of sum''' or '''addition principle''' is a basic [[combinatorial principles|counting principle]].  Stated simply, it is the idea that if we have ''A'' ways of doing something and ''B'' ways of doing another thing and we can not do both at the same time, then there are ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'' ways to choose one of the actions.

More formally, the rule of sum is a fact about [[set theory]].  It states that sum of the sizes of a finite collection of pairwise [[disjoint sets]] is the size of the union of these sets.  That is, if &lt;math&gt;S_{1}, S_{2},..., S_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint sets, then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;|S_{1}|+|S_{2}|+\cdots+|S_{n}| = |S_{1} \cup S_{2} \cup \cdots \cup S_{n}| &lt;/math&gt;

== Simple example ==

A woman has decided to shop at one store today, either in the north part of town or the south part of town. If she visits the north part of town, she will shop at either a mall, a furniture store, or a jewelry store (3 ways). If she visits the south part of town then she will shop at either a clothing store or a shoe store (2 ways).

Thus there are 3+2=5 possible shops the woman could end up shopping at today.

== Inclusion–exclusion principle ==

{{main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}

The inclusion–exclusion principle can be thought of as a generalization of the rule of sum in that it too enumerates the number of elements in the union of some sets (but does not require the sets to be disjoint). It states that if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are finite sets, then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr| &amp; {} =\sum_{i=1}^n\left|A_i\right|
-\sum_{i,j\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\right| \\
&amp; {}\qquad +\sum_{i,j,k\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\ \cdots\ + \left(-1\right)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Secondary notation''' is the set of [[sensory cue|visual cues]] used to improve the readability of a [[formal notation]]. Examples of secondary notation include the [[syntax highlighting]] of computer [[source code]], sizes and [[color code]]s for easy recognition of [[consumer symbol]]s such as [[bank note]]s or [[coin]]s, or the regular typographic conventions often found in [[technical book]]s to highlight sections with the same type of content.

Secondary notation provides redundant (more than necessary) information; if the visual cues are the only way that some information is provided, such as in [[traffic light]]s, or a [[Legend (chart)|chart's key]], it is not secondary. Secondary notation is often not a part of the formal notation itself. Rather, it is a method of organizing the formal notation to allow it to be more easily understood. Thus, secondary notation does not change the actual meaning of the formal notation, rather it allows for the meaning to be readily understood. In text such as [[Programming language|programming languages]], this can be done using cues such as [[Indent style|indentation]] and [[Color code|coloring]]. In formal graphical notations, this can be done through the use of symmetry or proximity to indicate relatedness.

==In different contexts==

Secondary notation annotates formal notation in a number of contexts which can be broken down to two main domains: text and graphics.

===Textual context===

There are a number of common instances of secondary notation that are seen in text. Secondary notation is common in [[typography]] and in [[code editor]]s appearing as boldness, italics, and spacing/indentation.

====Textual secondary notation in computer source code====

Secondary notation in the form of coloring and indentation is commonly implemented in [[integrated development environment]]s to make source code more readable and make the formal notation more understandable. The following [[C (programming language)|C source code]] does not use secondary notation to ease the interpretation of the formal notation:

&lt;code&gt;
int main(){while(true){printf("I'm stuck in an infinite loop!");}}
&lt;/code&gt;

The following is the same code, but with indentation and [[syntax highlight]]ing. As a result, the formal notation of C is easier to read:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main()
{
    while (true) {
        printf("I'm stuck in an infinite loop!");
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Textual secondary notation in typography====

A number of examples of secondary notation that commonly appear in English writing include

* '''[[Emphasis (typography)#Font styles and variants|Boldness]]''' which is used to put emphasis on a certain area of text.
* ''[[Italic type|Italics]]'' which is another method of applying emphasis on a certain area of text.
* The following example effectively uses [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]] to separate items on a shopping list that must be bought at different stores. Indented items all must be bought at the store within which the items are nested.

&lt;source lang="md"&gt;
 1. Allison's Frozen Foods 
     - Frozen Tuna
     - Chicken patties
     - Fish sticks
     - 2lb of hamburgers
  
 2. Sarah's Groceries
     - 3 boxes of cereal
     - 2 boxes of fruit juice
     - 2 dozen eggs 
  
 3. Jim's Formal Wear
     - 2 dress shirts
     - 1 orange tie
&lt;/source&gt;

===Graphical context===
Secondary notation is commonly used in graphical contexts to better convey information beyond what the formal notation of the graphic makes explicit.

==== Flowcharts ====
[[File:Well drawn process model (vertically oriented).png|thumb|This is a well drawn model of the steps a user would take to place an order for some products on a website.]]
[[File:Poorly drawn process model of ordering from a website.png|thumb|This is a poorly drawn model of the steps a user would take to place an order for some products on a website.]]
A graphical representation that has been well studied and can be heavily impacted by secondary notation is a [[flowchart]] and especially [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]]. Research has shown that there are a number of layout factors unincorporated into the formal notation that impact a flowchart's ease of understanding:
# '''Minimize arc crossings:''' the number of times lines cross should be kept to a minimum to ease traceability. In [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] all the arc (line) crossings  are forbidden.
# '''Minimize line bends:''' additional bends add to the visual complexity of the model
# '''Leverage symmetry:''' position elements symmetrically when possible
# '''Align labels horizontally:''' textual labels are easier to read when aligned horizontally
# '''Use of locality:''' group related items together to be easily recognizable

The examples on the right show how these techniques can drastically affect the ease of understanding when looking at a process model. The model depicts a simplified process for ordering products from a website. Both diagrams contain exactly the same blocks with the same interconnections. However, the one that uses better secondary notation can be readily understood whereas the other model requires careful analysis to understand its contents.

==== Misuse ====
While inadequate use of secondary notation can significantly increase the amount of effort necessary to understand a model, misuse of secondary notation can also be a detriment. Use of symmetry can make a graphic more visually appealing, but can also convey misconceptions if used incorrectly. For instance, placing unrelated items close together may cause a reader to perceive them as being related. Additionally, arbitrary use of coloring may distract a reader as they wonder about the meanings of the various colors.

==Experts vs. novices==
The ability of individuals to understand and use secondary notation has been shown{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} to vary based on experience within the relevant field. Experts in a field are generally more able to utilize the clues provided by secondary notation. Specifically, while reading diagrams, experts have been shown to have more skill at reading the larger structure of the diagram and using it to guide their examination of the details provided by the formal notation. This compares to novices who often focusing on the details of the formal notation and ignoring the hints provided by the secondary notation.

There are also differences based on level of experience/expertise when creating documents that utilize secondary notation. Experts tend to be more consistent in their use of conventions while novices tend to vary between conventions, sometimes adhering on a surface level, but failing to convey the desired information. In the case of circuit diagrams, this is illustrated by common novice mistakes such as creating visual symmetry where there is no logical symmetry and frequent transitions between differing secondary notation conventions.

== As part of formal notation ==
In some cases, secondary notation is part of the formal notation. Such formal notations attempt to improve readability by enforcing the presence of visual cues. The trade-off is that, what in many other cases is only secondary notation (like, for example, indentation in [[free-form language]]s), is now part of the formal notation, and thus is not optional.

For example, the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language requires source code to follow strict indentation rules. This is intended to improve readability of the code, by ensuring that statements that are at the same level of nesting within a block are aligned to the same column. Other types of secondary notation, however, are not part of the formal notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk|title=Python:  Myths about Indentation|website=www.secnetix.de|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when wrapping long lines, every line that is a continuation of a previous line can be indented arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/|title=PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code|website=www.python.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
if x == 1:
    print "x is 1"
    print "x is odd"
print "This is always printed"
    # this is illegal
    print "Hello world"
str = " ".join (
    "these words are indented",
    "for better readability")
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Markdown]] also uses indentation as part of the formal syntax of the language. Indentation is required in Markdown when creating certain source code representations of [[block quotation]]s as well as when creating sections of source code to be rendered as the code itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|title = Markdown Syntax|date = 2015-04-19|accessdate = 2015-04-19|website = Daring Fireball|publisher = |last = Gruber|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory of self-serving biases first came to attention in the late 1960s to early 1970s. As research on this topic continued to grow some people saw concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Dale|author2=Michael Ross|date=1975|title=Self-serving Biases in the Attribution of Causality: Fact or Fiction?|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/82_Psychological_Bulletin_213_(Miller).pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=82|issue=2|pages=213–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, fear emerged that the hypothesis would prove to be incorrect much like the perceptual defense hypothesis by Dixon. However, the theory now holds strong. When this theory was still being developed it was during the research of [[attribution bias]]. [[Fritz Heider]] found that in ambiguous situations people made attributions based on their own needs and in order to maintain a higher self-esteem and viewpoint. This specific tendency became what we now know as self-serving. Miller and Ross conducted a study in 1975 that was one of the earliest to assess not only self-serving bias but they looked at the attributions for successes and failures within this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=James|author2=Rutger U |author3=Douglass Coll |title=Evidence for a self-serving bias in the attribution of causality|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=45|issue=3|pages=430–441|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1977.tb00162.x |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the self-serving bias people create is rational and not dependent on one's need for self-esteem. This means that if the outcome of an event is consistent with the person's expectation, then they will make dispositional (internal) factors. On the other hand, if the outcome of the event doesn't match the person's expectations, they will make situational attributions by blaming their surroundings instead of themselves.

==Methods==

===Laboratory testing===
Investigations of the self-serving bias in the laboratory differ depending on the experimental goals, but have basic fundamental aspects. Participants perform some task, often of intelligence, social sensitivity, teaching ability, or therapy skills.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; Participants may be asked to work alone, in pairs, or in groups. After task completion, participants are given randomized bogus feedback. Some studies employ emotion-induction mechanisms to investigate moderating effects on the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Finally, participants make attributions for the given outcomes. These attributions are assessed by the researchers to determine implications for the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt;

===Neural experimentation===
Some more modern testing employs neural imaging techniques to supplement the fundamental self-serving bias laboratory procedures. Neural correlates of the self-serving bias have been investigated by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),&lt;ref name="Blackwood-2003" /&gt; as well as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref name="Krusemark et al" /&gt; These procedures allow for insight into brain area activity during exhibition of a self-serving bias, as well as a mechanism to differentiate brain activity between healthy and clinical populations.&lt;ref name="Seidel-2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Eva-Maria|author2=Satterthwaite, Theodore D. |author3=Eickhoff, Simon B. |author4=Schneider, Frank |author5=Gur, Ruben C. |author6=Wolf, Daniel H. |author7=Habel, Ute |author8=Derntl, Birgit |title=Neural correlates of depressive realism — An fMRI study on causal attribution in depression|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|year=2011|volume=138|issue=3|pages=268–276|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.041|pmid=22377511 |pmc=3565123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalistic investigation===
Retrospective performance outcomes can be used in investigation of the self-serving bias. An example of this is reported company performance followed up by self-report of outcome attributions.&lt;ref name=Hooghiemstra /&gt; These self-report attributions can then be used to assess how successes and failures are viewed by company employees and executives. This method can be used for numerous outcome variables to determine the presence or absence of the self-serving bias.

==Factors and variables==

===Motivation===
Two types of [[motivation]] affect the self-serving bias: self-enhancement and self-presentation.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt; Self-enhancement aims to uphold one's own self-worth, and attributing successes internally and failures externally helps individuals in their self-enhancement. Self-presentation refers to the drive to convey a desired image to others and make self-serving attributions to manage impressions.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt; For example, they claim personal responsibility for successes but not failures in an attempt to influence how others perceive them. Motivation works in conjunction with cognitive factors to produce personally satisfying and self-preserving attributions for outcomes.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt;

===Locus of control===
[[Locus of control]] is one of the main influences of attribution style. Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they have personal control over situations and that their actions matter. Those with an external locus of control believe that outside forces, chance, and luck determine situations and that their actions cannot change anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M. |author2=Zhang, Liqing |author3=Im, Charles|title=It's Beyond My Control: A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Increasing Externality in Locus of Control, 1960-2002|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=308–319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_5|pmid=15454351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with an external locus of control are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias following failure than those with an internal locus of control.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=W. Keith|author2=Sedikides, Constantine |title=Self-threat magnifies the self-serving bias: A meta-analytic integration.|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=1999|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23–43|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.3.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wichman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wichman|first=Harvey|author2=Ball, James |title=Locus of control, self-serving biases, and attitudes towards safety in general aviation pilots|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|year=1983|volume=54|issue=6|pages=507–510|pmid=6882309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in attribution style between individuals with internal and external loci of control, however, is not as marked in successful outcomes, as individuals with both types attribution style have less need to defend their [[self-image]]s in success. Airplane pilots with an internal locus of control were likely to exhibit a self-serving bias in regard to their skill and levels of safety.&lt;ref name=Wichman /&gt;

===Gender===
Studies have shown a slight discrepancy in males' and females' use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, men tended to attribute negative interactions to their partners more than women did.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christensen|first=A.|author2=Sullaway, M.|author3=King, C. E.|date=|year=1983|title=Systematic error in behavioral reports of dyadic interaction: Egocentric bias and content effects|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-31566-001|journal=Behavioral Assessment|volume=5|issue=2|pages=129–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias more than women, although the study did not look at positive interaction attributions.

===Age===
Older adults have been shown to make more internal causal attributions for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lachman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lachman|first=M.|title=When Bad Things Happen to Older People: Age Differences in A ttributional Style|journal=Psychology and Aging|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=607–609|doi=10.1037/0882-7974.5.4.607|pmid=2278689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differential attribution style at different ages indicates that the self-serving bias may be less likely in older adults. These older adults who attributed negative outcomes to more internal factors also rated themselves to be in poorer health, so negative emotional factors may confound the found age effects.

===Culture===
There is evidence of cross-cultural differences in the tendency to exhibit the self-serving bias, particularly when considering individualistic (Western) versus collectivistic (non-Western) societies.&lt;ref name=Al-Zah&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Zahrini|first=S.|author2=Kaplowitz, S. |title=Attributional Biases in Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultures: A Comparison of Americans with Saudis|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1993|volume=56|issue=3|pages=223–233|doi=10.2307/2786780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family and group goals are important in collectivistic cultures. In contrast, the individual goals and identity focused on in individualistic societies increases the need for people within those cultures to guard and boost their personal self-esteem. While differences have been shown, conflicting literature has cited similarity in causal attributions across both individual and collective cultures, specifically between Belgium, West Germany, South Korea, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=B.|author2=Forsterlung, F. |author3=Weiner, B. |title=Perceiving the Causes of Success and Failure: A Cross-Cultural Examination of Attributional Concepts|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1989|volume=20|issue=2|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/0022022189202005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation and information comparing United States and Japanese companies outcome attributions shows that the meaning and psychological function of internal versus external attributions are similar across cultures but that the difference is in the strategy of attribution.&lt;ref name=Hooghiemstra/&gt; No consensus has been reached on cross-culture influences on the self-serving bias, though some systematic differences do seem to be present, especially between Western and non-Western cultures. For example, a study conducted by Kudo and Numuzaki named “Explicit and Direct Self-Serving Bias in Japan Reexamination of Self-Serving Bias for Success and Failure” showed that the participants in the success condition provided more internal attributions than the participants in the failure condition even though past research has constantly shown that Japanese people don’t tend to show a self-serving bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudo|first=Eriko|last2=Numazaki|first2=Makoto|title=Explicit and Direct Self-Serving Bias in Japan|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.db19.linccweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022022103256475|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=5|pages=511–521|doi=10.1177/0022022103256475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, another study conducted by Hugten and Witteloostuijn named “The foreign language effect on the self-serving bias: A field experiment in the high school classroom” displayed the results that student participants between the ages of 13-15 who mainly process feedback in a non-native English tend to show more self-serving bias than those who process feedback in their native Dutch language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The foreign language effect on the selfserving bias: A field experiment in the high school classroom|last=van Hugten|first=Joeri|last2=van Witteloostuijn|first2=A|date=9 February 2018|website=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0192143|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role===
Investigations of self-serving bias distinguish between the role of participants as the actor of a task or as the observer of someone else performing a task, relating closely to [[actor–observer asymmetry]]. Actors of a task exhibit the self-serving bias in their attributions to their own success or failure feedback, whereas observers do not make the same attributions about another person's task outcome.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; Observers tend to be more objective in their tendency to ascribe internal or external attributions to other people's outcomes. This may be due to the fact that the self-image of actors is challenged directly and therefore actors feel the need to protect their own self-image, but do not feel the same inclination to do so when the self-image of others is threatened.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterHeatherton1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=Roy F.|last2=Heatherton|first2=Todd F.|last3=Tice|first3=Dianne M.|title=When ego threats lead to self-regulation failure: Negative consequences of high self-esteem|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|year=1993|pages=141–156|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.141|pmid=8421250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-esteem and emotion===
Emotions can influence feelings of [[self-esteem]], which in turn alters the need to protect one's self-identity. Individuals with higher self-esteem are thought to have more to protect in their self-image, and therefore exhibit the self-serving bias more often than those individuals with lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; In a study, participants who were induced to feel the [[emotion]]s of guilt or revulsion were less likely to make self-serving attributions for success and less likely to make self-protecting attributions for failure.&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Martin D.|title=Emotion and the Self-Serving Bias|journal=Current Psychology|year=2011|volume=30|issue=4|pages=345–354|doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman concluded that the two emotions of guilt and revulsion lead to a drop in self-esteem, and thus a reduction in the use of the self-serving bias.

===Self-awareness and probability of improvement===

The relationship between individuals' awareness levels and perceived probability of improvement also influences the activation of the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name= Duval&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duval|first=Thomas|author2=Paul Silvia |title=Self-Awareness, Probability of Improvement, and the Self-Serving Bias|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2002|volume=82|issue=1|pages=49–61|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.1.49|pmid=11811633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with high self-awareness attribute failure internally when they perceive a high probability of improvement. However, they will engage in self-serving bias, attributing failure externally when they perceive a low probability of improvement. Individuals low in self-awareness will attribute failure externally regardless of their perceived probability of improvement.

==Real-world implications==

===Interpersonal relations===
Whether the self-serving bias is exhibited may depend on interpersonal closeness, relationships in a social context. When working in pairs to complete interdependent outcome tasks, relationally close pairs did not show a self-serving bias while relationally distant pairs did.&lt;ref name="Campbell et al." /&gt; A study on self-serving bias in relational context suggests this is due to the idea that close relationships place limits on an individual's self enhancement tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedikides|first=Constantine|author2=Keith Campbell |author3=Glenn Reeder |author4=Andrew Elliot |title=The Self-Serving Bias in Relational Context|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=74|issue=2|pages=378–386|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.2.378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The individual becomes more modest, when in a close relationship, and is less likely to use that relationship for his or her own benefit. Understanding why partners refrain from the self-serving bias is still in question but can partially be explained by favorable impression those in close relationships have for one another. A similar result was shown when looking at pairs of friends and strangers. Pairs performed an interdependent outcomes creativity test and were then given a bogus pipeline for a success or failure outcome. Strangers exhibited the self-serving bias in responsibility attributions, but friends tended to make joint attributions for both success and failure. Researchers have taken this as evidence for "boundaries on self-enhancement".&lt;ref name="Campbell et al." /&gt; In another study conducted in 2016, the implicit and explicit evaluation of 108 partners and exes as parents who were either married, separated or divorced was researched to investigate if the self-serving bias influenced them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Self-Serving Bias in the Implicit and Explicit Evaluation of Partners and Exes as Parents: A Pilot Study|last=Verrastro|first=Valeria|authorlink=|date=February 1, 2016|website=|publisher=Psychological Reports|pages=251–265|doi=10.1177/0033294115626819|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using two Implicit Association tests, one measuring Self vs Partner and the other measuring Self vs Ex, results showed that most of the time, men and women consider their exes or partners as less suitable parents which demonstrates the self-serving bias as they “ascribe more easily successes to internal factors” and failures towards their partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, another result demonstrated that “women revealed a higher self-serving bias than men on both implicit and explicit measures, but only toward exes and not toward current partners” because they consider their exes as an out-group and their partners as an in-group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Workplace===
The self-serving bias can be found in several aspects of the workplace. Research shows that the self-serving bias is used to explain employment: being hired for a job is attributed to personal factors, whereas failure to obtain a job is attributed to external factors.&lt;ref name=Furnham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham, A.|title=Explanations for Unemployment in Britain|journal=Journal of European Social Psychology|year=1982|volume=12|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420120402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental investigation of the explanations for unemployment through asking participants to imagine particular job opportunities and likelihood of getting those jobs, however, did not show such a self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt; Researchers claim that this may be due to the actor-observer role differences in the self-serving bias. Within the workplace, victims of serious occupational accidents tend to attribute their accidents to external factors, whereas their coworkers and management tend to attribute the accidents to the victims' own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyekye|first=Seth Ayim|author2=Salminen, Simo |title=The self-defensive attribution hypothesis in the work environment: Co-workers' perspectives|journal=Safety Science|year=2006|volume=44|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2005.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpersonal dynamics of the self-serving bias in the previous section have implications for attributions for outcomes in the workplace. In an investigation of [[group dynamics]], virtual group members had to complete a decision-making task via computer-mediated communication. Results showed that the self-serving bias was present in negative outcomes, and that greater interpersonal distance from group members increased blame for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Walther&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J. B.|author2=Bazarova, N. N. |title=Misattribution in virtual groups: The effects of member distribution on self-serving bias and partner blame|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narcissism====
Studies revealed that [[narcissism]] was related to enhanced self-ratings of leadership, even when controlling for the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five traits]]. Another study showed that narcissism was related to enhanced leadership self-perceptions; indeed, whereas narcissism was significantly positively correlated with self-ratings of leadership, it was significantly negatively related to other ratings of leadership. This study also revealed that narcissism was related to more favorable self-ratings of [[workplace deviance]] and contextual performance compared to other (supervisor) ratings.&lt;ref name=JAP&gt;{{cite journal|title=Loving Yourself Abundantly: Relationship of the Narcissistic Personality to Self- and Other Perceptions of Workplace Deviance, Leadership, and Task and Contextual Performance|url=http://www.timothy-judge.com/Judge,%20LePine,%20and%20Rich%20JAP%202006.pdf|work=Journal of Applied Psychology|publisher=|date=2006|volume= 91|issue=4|pages= 762–776|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.762 |last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Lepine|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Rich|first3=Bruce L.|pmid=16834504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because narcissism broadly reflects strong self-admiration and behavioral tendencies which may not be viewed positively by others it is possible that narcissism influences self- and other perceptions differently, and insight into this possibility may be important given that differences in perceptions are the foundation for certain types of performance management and development practices.&lt;ref name=JAP/&gt;

===Classroom===
Studies in both lab and field settings have shown both teachers and students hold self-serving biases in regard to outcomes in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAllister|first=Hunter A.|title=Self-serving bias in the classroom: Who shows it? Who knows it?|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1996|volume=88|issue=1|pages=123–131|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.88.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributions hold the potential for conflict between teacher and student since neither will take personal responsibility, as the student may blame the teacher while the teacher holds the student accountable. However, both teachers and students also reported being aware of the others' bias, which indicated there may be a feasible conflict resolution mechanism.

===Computer technology===
Computers have become an integral part of everyday life, and research has shown that individuals may subconsciously treat interactions with computers as they would treat a social situation.&lt;ref name="Moon 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moon|first=Youngme|title=Intimate exchanges: Using computers to elicit self-disclosure from consumers|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=324–340|doi=10.1086/209566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding combined with what is known about the self-serving bias in interpersonal relations indicates that consumers that use a computer to buy products will take personal credit for successful purchases but blame the computer for negative purchase experiences. It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have "intimate [[self-disclosure]]" with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the discloser feel vulnerable.&lt;ref name=Moon /&gt; Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serenko|first= A.|year=2007|title= Are interface agents scapegoats? Attributions of responsibility in human-agent interaction|journal= Interacting with Computers |volume= 19|issue= 2|pages=293–303|url=http://www.aserenko.com/papers/IwC_Published_Scapegoats_Serenko.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2006.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Individuals have been shown to exhibit the self-serving bias in regard to sports outcomes. In one study, collegiate wrestlers at the Division I level made self-reported attributions of the outcomes in their preseason matches. Winners were more likely than losers to attribute the match outcome to internal causes.&lt;ref name=DeMichele /&gt; The researchers note that wrestling is a one-on-one sport and has clearly defined winners. Therefore, other sports of this nature may show similar results, but other team sports or sports with more ambiguous outcomes may not show the same pattern for the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=DeMichele /&gt; In another study conducted in 1987, the research focused on comparing the self-serving attributions made by individuals who played single sports and those who played in teams. The study gathered 549 statements that were coded for attributional content from lone performers such as tennis and golf players and team performers such as baseball, football or basketball players.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaccaro|first=Stephen J.|last2=Peterson|first2=Christopher|last3=Walker|first3=Steven|date=1987|title=Self-Serving Attributions for Individual and Group Performance|jstor=2786826|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=50|issue=3|pages=257–263|doi=10.2307/2786826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that “lone performers made more self-serving attributions than team performers” because their performance outcomes have a greater effect on their individual esteem unlike for group outcomes where it “must often be distributed among all participants.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To expand upon self-serving attributions made by team sports, a study conducted in 1980 coded “newspaper accounts of baseball and football for attributional content.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Richard|last2=Russel|first2=Dan|date=1980|title=Attributions in the Sports Pages|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|pages=29–38|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.1.29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coding of the newspaper accounts showed that there was a “tendency to make internal attributions for success and external attributions for failure” which supports the self-serving bias as about 75% of the attributions from winning teams were internal while about 55% of attributions from losing teams were internal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Depression===
{{See also|Depressive realism}}

Clinically depressed patients tend to show less of a self-serving bias than individuals in the general population.&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al" /&gt; In a study exploring the effects of mood on the self-serving bias, the moods of participants were manipulated to be either positive or negative. Negative mood participants were less likely to attribute successful outcomes to the self than positive mood participants, attributing success to external factors.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=R.|author2=Holley, P. |author3=Shaffer, C. |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=130|issue=4|pages=565–567|pmid=2232740|title=Effect of transient mood state on the self-serving bias|doi=10.1080/00224545.1990.9924621}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the negative mood within depressed individuals as well as their self-focused attention explains why clinically depressed populations are less likely to exhibit the self-serving bias than normal populations.&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al" /&gt;

==Neural research outcomes==

===Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)===
The self-serving bias has been investigated by the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI method]] in normal populations. Attributions using the bias show activation in the [[dorsal striatum]], which plays a role in motivated behavior, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulate.&lt;ref name="Blackwood-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwood|first=NJ|author2=Bentall RP |author3=Fytche DH |author4=Simmons A |author5=Murray RM |author6=Howard RJ. |title=Self-responsibility and the self-serving bias: an fMRI investigation of causal attributions|journal=NeuroImage|year=2003|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1076–85|doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00331-8|pmid=14568477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Eva-Maria|author2=Eickhoff, Simon B. |author3=Kellermann, Thilo |author4=Schneider, Frank |author5=Gur, Ruben C. |author6=Habel, Ute |author7=Derntl, Birgit |title=Who is to blame?

===Electroencephalography (EEG)===
In a study employing the [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] method of examining brain activation, participants were given bogus outcome feedback that indicated either success or failure and told to make attributions. Different from non-self-serving responses, self-serving responses did not show increased dorsomedial frontal cortex activity preceding attribution decisions. Such lack of brain activity implies that self-control, which is controlled by the dorsomedial frontal cortex, is not as prominent in self-serving attributions as non-self-serving ones.&lt;ref name="Krusemark et al" /&gt;

'''Starlight''' is a software product originally developed at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] and now by Future Point Systems. It is an advanced [[Visual analytics|visual analysis]] environment. In addition to using [[information visualization]] to show the importance of individual pieces of data by showing how they relate to one another, it also contains a small suite of tools useful for collaboration and data sharing, as well as data conversion, processing, augmentation and loading.

The software, originally developed for the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]], allows users to load data from XML files, databases, RSS feeds, web services, HTML files, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV, Adobe PDF, TXT files, etc. and analyze it with a variety of visualizations and tools. The system integrates structured, unstructured, geospatial, and multimedia data, offering comparisons of information at multiple levels of abstraction, simultaneously and in near real-time. In addition Starlight allows users to build their own named entity-extractors using a combination of algorithms, targeted normalization lists and regular expressions in the Starlight Data Engineer (SDE).

As an example, Starlight might be used to look for correlations in a database containing records about chemical spills. An analyst could begin by grouping records according to the cause of the spill to reveal general trends. Sorting the data a second time, they could apply different colors based on related details such as the company responsible, age of equipment or geographic location. Maps and photographs could be integrated into the display, making it even easier to recognize connections among multiple variables.

Starlight has been deployed to both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and used on a number of large-scale projects.

PNNL began developing Starlight in the mid-90's, with funding from the Land Information Warfare Agency,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2002-03/dnnl-ias061402.php Information analysis—by Starlight]&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the Army Intelligence and Security Command and continued developed at the laboratory with funding from the NSA and the CIA. Starlight integrates visual representations of reports, radio transcripts, radar signals, maps and other information. The software system was recently honored with an R&amp;D 100 Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/ShowPR.aspx?PUBCODE=014&amp;ACCT=1400000100&amp;ISSUE=0309&amp;RELTYPE=PR&amp;ORIGRELTYPE=FE&amp;PRODCODE=00000000&amp;PRODLETT=AE&amp;CommonCount=0 R&amp;D 100 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; for technical innovation.

In 2006 Future Point Systems, a Silicon Valley startup, acquired rights to jointly develop and distribute the Starlight product in cooperation with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The software is now also used outside of the military/intelligence communities in a number of commercial environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">In [[mathematical logic]], '''System U''' and '''System U&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''' are [[pure type system]]s, i.e. special forms of a [[typed lambda calculus]] with an arbitrary number of [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Many-sorted_structures|sorts]], axioms and rules (or dependencies between the sorts). They were both proved inconsistent by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=Girard1972&gt;{{cite paper |first=Jean-Yves |last=Girard |title=Interprétation fonctionnelle et Élimination des coupure de l'arithmétique d'ordre supérieur |year=1972 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kw/scans/girard72thesis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result led to the realization that [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]]'s original [[intuitionistic type theory#Martin-Löf type theories|1971 type theory]] was inconsistent as it allowed the same "Type in Type" behaviour that Girard's paradox exploits.

== Formal definition ==
System U is defined&lt;ref name=SoerensenUrzyczyn2006&gt;{{cite book |first=Morten Heine |last=Sørensen |first2=Paweł |last2=Urzyczyn |title=Lectures on the Curry–Howard isomorphism |location= |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0-444-52077-5 |chapter=Pure type systems and the lambda cube }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352}} as a pure type system with
* three [[Many-sorted logic|sorts]] &lt;math&gt;\{\ast, \square, \triangle\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* two axioms &lt;math&gt;\{\ast:\square, \square:\triangle\}&lt;/math&gt;; and
* five rules &lt;math&gt;\{(\ast,\ast), (\square,\ast), (\square,\square), (\triangle,\ast), (\triangle,\square)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

System U&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is defined the same with the exception of the &lt;math&gt;(\triangle, \ast)&lt;/math&gt; rule.

The sorts &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; are conventionally called “Type” and “[[kind (type theory)|Kind]]”, respectively; the sort &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a specific name. The two axioms describe the containment of types in kinds (&lt;math&gt;\ast:\square&lt;/math&gt;) and kinds in &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\square:\triangle&lt;/math&gt;). Intuitively, the sorts describe a hierarchy in the ''nature'' of the terms.
#   All values have a ''type'', such as a base type (''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;b : \mathrm{Bool}&lt;/math&gt; is read as “{{math|''b''}} is a boolean”) or a (dependent) function type (''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;f : \mathrm{Nat} \to \mathrm{Bool}&lt;/math&gt; is read as “{{math|''f''}} is a function from natural numbers to booleans”).
#   &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; is the sort of all such types (&lt;math&gt;t : \ast&lt;/math&gt; is read as “{{math|''t''}} is a type”). From &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; we can build more terms, such as &lt;math&gt;\ast \to \ast&lt;/math&gt; which is the ''kind'' of unary type-level operators (''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{List} : \ast \to \ast&lt;/math&gt; is read as “{{math|List}} is a function from types to types”, that is, a polymorphic type). The rules restrict how we can form new kinds.
#   &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; is the sort of all such kinds (&lt;math&gt;k : \square&lt;/math&gt; is read as “{{math|''k''}} is a kind”). Similarly we can build related terms, according to what the rules allow.
#   &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is the sort of all such terms.

The rules govern the dependencies between the sorts: &lt;math&gt;(\ast,\ast)&lt;/math&gt; says that values may depend on values ([[first-class function|functions]]), &lt;math&gt;(\square,\ast)&lt;/math&gt; allows values to depend on types ([[parametric polymorphism|polymorphism]]), &lt;math&gt;(\square,\square)&lt;/math&gt; allows types to depend on types ([[type constructor|type operators]]), and so on.

== Girard's paradox&lt;!--'Girard's paradox' redirects here--&gt; ==
The definitions of System U and U&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; allow the assignment of [[parametric polymorphism|polymorphic]] [[kind (type theory)|kind]]s to ''generic constructors'' in analogy to polymorphic types of terms in classical polymorphic lambda calculi, such as [[System F]]. An example of such a generic constructor might be{{r|SoerensenUrzyczyn2006|page=353}} (where ''k'' denotes a kind variable)

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda k^\square \lambda\alpha^{k \to k} \lambda\beta^k\!. \alpha (\alpha \beta) \;:\; \Pi k : \square((k \to k) \to k \to k)&lt;/math&gt;.

This mechanism is sufficient to construct a term with the type &lt;math&gt;(\forall p:\ast, p) = \bot&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that every type is [[type inhabitation|inhabited]]. By the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], this is equivalent to all logical propositions being provable, which makes the system inconsistent.

'''Girard's paradox'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the [[type theory|type-theoretic]] analogue of [[Russell's paradox]] in [[naive set theory|set theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5213">'''''Thumos''''' (also commonly spelled ''thymos''; {{lang-grc-gre|θυμός}}) is a Greek word expressing the concept of "[[spiritedness]]" (as in "spirited stallion" or "spirited debate"). The word indicates a physical association with breath or blood and is also used to express the human desire for recognition.

==History==

In [[Homer]]'s works, ''thumos'' was used to denote emotions, desire, or an internal urge.  ''Thumos'' was a permanent possession of living man, to which his thinking and feeling belonged. When a Homeric hero is under emotional stress, he may externalize his ''thumos'' and converse with or scold it.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;Long, A. A. Psychological Ideas in Antiquity. In: ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''. 1973-74 [2003]. [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaGenText/tei/DicHist4.xml;chunk.id=dv4-01 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and his later work ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' discuss ''thumos'' as one of the three constituent parts of the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. In the ''Phaedrus'', Plato depicts ''logos'' as a charioteer driving the two horses ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' and ''thumos'' (erotic love and spiritedness are to be guided by logos). In the ''Republic'' (Book IV) soul becomes divided into (See [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul]]):.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;
* ''epithumia'' ("[[Appetition|appetite]]", "[[affection]]"), to which are ascribed bodily [[desire]]s; 
* ''thumos'' ("[[Passion (emotion)|passion]]"), the emotional element in virtue of which we [[Feeling|feel]] anger, fear, etc.;
* ''[[nous]]'' ("[[intellect]]", "[[reason]]"), which is or should be the controlling part which subjugates the appetites with the help of ''thumos''.

However, the term "[[emotion]]" is relatively modern. It was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]s, [[Feeling|sentiment]]s and [[affection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon,T. 2003. ''From Passions to Emotions: The Creation of a Secular Psychological Category''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 39. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9c8tNQVI4YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false link].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] used "[[Euthymia_(philosophy)|euthymia]]" (i.e. "good thumos") to refer to a condition in which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, superstition, or other [[Passions_(philosophy)|passions]]. For Democritus euthymia was one of the root aspects the goal of human life.

=== ''Thymos'' and democracy: megalothymia and isothymia===
"Megalothymia" refers to the need to be recognized as superior to others, while "isothymia" is the need to be recognized as merely equal to others. Both terms are [[neoclassical compounds]], coined by [[Francis Fukuyama]]. 

In his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'',  the author mentions "thymos" in relation to [[liberal democracy]] and recognition. He relates Socrates' ideas about ''Thymos'' and desire to how people want to be recognized within their government. Problems emerge when other people do not recognize another's ''Thymos'', and therefore do not provide the justice that it requires. In order for people to exist in harmony, Fukuyama argues, ''isothymia'' rather than ''megalothymia'' must be used to satisfy the human need for recognition. Any system that creates political inequality is necessarily feeding the ''megalothymia'' of some members while denying it to others.

Fukuyama explains how ''Thymos'' relates to history with the example of anti-communism in relation to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China. He states, "We cannot understand the totality of the revolutionary phenomenon unless we appreciate the working of thymotic anger and the demand for recognition that accompanied communism's economic crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, Francis.

[[File:Time's Paces.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The poem as it appears in the book ''Hymns and Other Stray Verses'' (1901)&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Time's Paces''' is a poem about the apparent speeding up of time as one gets older. It was written by [[Henry Twells]] (1823–1900) and published in his book ''Hymns and Other Stray Verses'' (1901). The poem was popularised by [[Guy Pentreath]] (1902–1985) in an amended version. Pentreath saw the poem ''Time's Paces'' attached to a clock case in the North Transept of [[Chester Cathedral]] where it is to be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;See this ChesterTourist.com website: http://www.chestertourist.com/cathedral.htm ''Retrieved 2012.02.22.'' Photographs of the clock and the poem are to be found by scrolling down this large collection of photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the poem was even set to music.&lt;ref&gt;See this 'Chester on the web' site about the restoration of the clock and the use of the song to mark its re-dedication. {{cite web |url=http://www.chesterontheweb.com/chester/94-chester-cathedral-events/473-chester-cathedral-clock-restored.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125094048/http://www.chesterontheweb.com/chester/94-chester-cathedral-events/473-chester-cathedral-clock-restored.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} ''Retrieved 2012-02-22.''&lt;/ref&gt; Pentreath quoted his version of the poem in his last sermon at [[Wrekin College]], [[Shropshire]] where he was headmaster till 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Information supplied by e-mail by the Assistant Archivist at [[Cheltenham College]] in [[Gloucestershire]] where Pentreath was headmaster from 1952 to 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; His version then entered the public domain. Perhaps he wrote the poem down from memory and reconstructed it in the process. He may not have consciously intended to improve on Twells' version.

The last four lines of Pentreath's version were missed out in [[Gerald James Whitrow|Whitrow's]] quotation in his book, ''The Natural Philosophy of Time'' and in some quotations in other books. The first sentence also begins with "For" as in "For when I was a babe . . ." This was added by [[Gerald James Whitrow|Whitrow]] who may have received the poem orally or informally from Pentreath since he gives no reference source for the poem in his otherwise well referenced book.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gerald James Whitrow|G.J. Whitrow]], '' The Natural Philosophy of Time'', Oxford: the Clarendon Press, 1st ed. 1961, 2nd ed. 1980, Ch. 2, p.63, and also in his later book: ''The Nature of Time'', London: Penguin, 1975, p. 39. Whitrow's shortened version also appears in ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]], Oxford: OUP, 1988, p. 641, but it is wrongly attributed to [[Henry Twells]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''unimodality''' means possessing a unique [[mode (statistics)|mode]]. More generally, unimodality means there is only a single highest value, somehow defined, of some mathematical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Unimodal|title=Unimodal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodal probability distribution ==
[[File:Normal distribution pdf.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' [[probability density function]] of normal distributions, an example of unimodal distribution.]]
[[File:Bimodal.png|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' a simple bimodal distribution.]]
[[File:Bimodal geological.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' A bimodal distribution. Note that only the largest peak would correspond to a mode in the strict sense of the definition of mode]]

In [[statistics]], a '''unimodal probability distribution''' or '''unimodal distribution''' is a [[probability distribution]] which has a single peak. The term "mode" in this context refers to any peak of the distribution, not just to the strict definition of [[mode (statistics)|mode]] which is usual in statistics.  

If there is a single mode, the distribution function is called "unimodal". If it has more modes it is "bimodal" (2), "trimodal" (3), etc., or in general, "multimodal".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Mode|title=Mode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 1 illustrates [[normal distribution]]s, which are unimodal. Other examples of unimodal distributions include [[Cauchy distribution]], [[Student's t-distribution]], [[chi-squared distribution]] and [[exponential distribution]]. Among discrete distributions, the [[binomial distribution]] and [[Poisson distribution]] can be seen as unimodal, though for some parameters they can have two adjacent values with the same probability.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate bimodal distributions.

===Other definitions===
Other definitions of unimodality in distribution functions also exist.

In continuous distributions, unimodality can be defined through the behavior of the [[cumulative distribution function]] (cdf).&lt;ref name=Khinchin&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.Ya. Khinchin|title=On unimodal distributions|journal=Trams. Res. Inst. Math. Mech.|publisher=University of Tomsk|volume=2|issue=2|year=1938|pages=1–7|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cdf is [[convex function|convex]] for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''m'' and [[concave function|concave]] for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''m'', then the distribution is unimodal, ''m'' being the mode. Note that under this definition the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] is unimodal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|title=Unimodal distribution|id=U/u095330|first=N.G.|last=Ushakov}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as any other distribution in which the maximum distribution is achieved for a range of values, e.g. trapezoidal distribution.  Note also that usually this definition allows for a discontinuity at the mode; usually in a continuous distribution the probability of any single value is zero, while this definition allows for a non-zero probability, or an "atom of probability", at the mode.

Criteria for unimodality can also be defined through the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the distribution&lt;ref name=Khinchin/&gt; or through its [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Random summation: limit theorems and applications|author=Vladimirovich Gnedenko and Victor Yu Korolev|ISBN=0-8493-2875-6|publisher=CRC-Press|year=1996}} p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to define a unimodal discrete distribution is by the occurrence of sign changes in the sequence of differences of the probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the unimodality of discrete distributions |journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica|first=P. |last=Medgyessy|volume= 2| issue = 1–4 |pages=245–257|date=March 1972|url=http://www.akademiai.com/content/j5012306777g764n/ |doi=10.1007/bf02018665}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discrete distribution with a [[probability mass function]], &lt;math&gt;\{p_n ;  n = \dots, -1, 0, 1, \dots \} &lt;/math&gt;, is called unimodal if the sequence &lt;math&gt;\dots, p_{-2} - p_{-1}, p_{-1} - p_0, p_0 - p_1, p_1 - p_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one sign change (when zeroes don't count).

===Uses and results===
One reason for the importance of distribution unimodality is that it allows for several important results. Several inequalities are given below which are only valid for unimodal distributions. Thus, it is important to assess whether or not a given data set comes from a unimodal distribution. Several tests for unimodality are given in the article on [[multimodal distribution]].

===Inequalities===
{{See also|Chebychev's inequality#Unimodal distributions}}

====Gauss's inequality====

A first important result is [[Gauss's inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauss|first=C. F.|authorlink=Carl Friedrich Gauss|year=1823|title=Theoria Combinationis Observationum Erroribus Minimis Obnoxiae, Pars Prior|journal=Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis Recentiores|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss's inequality gives an upper bound on the probability that a value lies more than any given distance from its mode. This inequality depends on unimodality.

====Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality====

A second is the [[Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D. F. Vysochanskij,  Y. I. Petunin |year=1980 |title=Justification of the 3&amp;sigma; rule for unimodal distributions |journal=Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics |volume=21 |pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; a refinement of the [[Chebyshev inequality]]. The Chebyshev inequality guarantees that in any probability distribution, "nearly all" the values are "close to" the mean value. The Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality refines this to even nearer values, provided that the distribution function is continuous and unimodal. Further results were shown by Sellke &amp; Sellke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mode, median and mean====

Gauss also showed in 1823 that for a [[unimodal distribution]]&lt;ref name=Gauss1823&gt;Gauss C.F. Theoria Combinationis Observationum Erroribus Minimis Obnoxiae. Pars Prior. Pars Posterior. Supplementum. Theory of the Combination of Observations Least Subject to Errors. Part One. Part Two. Supplement. 1995. Translated by G.W. Stewart.

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma \le \omega  \le 2 \sigma &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; | \nu - \mu | \le \sqrt{ \frac{ 3 }{ 4 } } \omega ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the median is ''ν'', the mean is ''μ'' and  ''ω'' is the root mean square deviation from the mode.

It can be shown for a unimodal distribution that the median ''ν'' and the  mean ''μ'' lie within (3/5)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.7746 standard deviations of each other.&lt;ref name="unimodal"&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0040585X97975447 Basu, Sanjib, and Anirban DasGupta. "The mean, median, and mode of unimodal distributions: a characterization." Theory of Probability &amp; Its Applications 41.2 (1997): 210-223.]&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \nu - \mu | }{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ \frac{ 3 } { 5 } }&lt;/math&gt;

where |.| is the absolute value.

A similar relation holds between the median and the mode ''θ'': they lie within 3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1.732 standard deviations of each other:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \nu - \theta |}{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ 3 }.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be shown that the mean and the mode lie within 3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; of each other.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \mu - \theta |}{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ 3 }.&lt;/math&gt;

====Skewness and kurtosis====

Rohatgi and Szekely have shown that the [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] of a unimodal distribution are related by the inequality:&lt;ref name=Rohatgi1989&gt;Rohatgi VK, Szekely GJ (1989) Sharp inequalities between skewness and kurtosis. Statistics &amp; Probability Letters 8:297-299&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma^2 - \kappa \le \frac{ 6 }{ 5 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''κ'' is the kurtosis and ''γ'' is the skewness.

Klaassen, Mokveld, and van Es derived a slightly different inequality (shown below) from the one derived by Rohatgi and Szekely (shown above), which tends to be more inclusive (i.e., yield more positives) in tests of unimodality:&lt;ref name=Klaassen2000&gt;Klaassen CAJ, Mokveld PJ, van Es B (2000) Squared skewness minus kurtosis bounded by 186/125 for unimodal distributions. Stat &amp; Prob Lett 50 (2) 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma^2 - \kappa \le \frac{ 186 }{ 125 } &lt;/math&gt;

==Unimodal function==
As the term "modal" applies to data sets and probability distribution, and not in general to functions, the definitions above do not apply. The definition of "unimodal" was extended to functions of [[real number]]s as well.

A common definition is as follows: a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'') is a '''unimodal function''' if for some value ''m'', it is [[monotonic]]ally increasing for ''x'' ≤ ''m'' and monotonically decreasing for ''x'' ≥ ''m''. In that case, the [[maximum]] value of ''f''(''x'') is ''f''(''m'') and there are no other local maxima.

Proving unimodality is often hard. One way consists in using the definition of that property, but it turns out to be suitable for simple functions only. A general method based on derivatives exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/thibaut.barthelemy/METRIC.pdf|title=On the unimodality of METRIC Approximation subject to normally distributed demands.|work=Method in appendix D, Example in theorem 2 page 5|accessdate=2013-08-28|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does not succeed for every function despite its simplicity.

Examples of unimodal functions include [[quadratic polynomial]] functions with a negative quadratic coefficient, [[tent map]] functions, and more.

The above is sometimes related to as "strong unimodality", from the fact that the monotonicity implied is ''strong monotonicity''. A function ''f''(''x'') is a '''weakly unimodal function''' if there exists a value ''m'' for which it is weakly monotonically increasing for ''x'' ≤ ''m'' and weakly monotonically decreasing for ''x'' ≥ ''m''.  In that case, the maximum value ''f''(''m'') can be reached for a continuous range of values of ''x''. An example of a weakly unimodal function which is not strongly unimodal is every other row in a [[Pascal triangle]].

Depending on context, unimodal function may also refer to a function that has only one local minimum, rather than maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/second.php?page=U.html|title=Mathematical Programming Glossary.|work=|accessdate=2010-07-07|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[local unimodal sampling]], a method for doing numerical optimization, is often demonstrated with such a function. It can be said that a unimodal function under this extension is a function with a single local [[extremum]].

One important property of unimodal functions is that the extremum can be found using [[search algorithm]]s such as [[golden section search]], [[ternary search]] or [[successive parabolic interpolation]].

==Other extensions==

A function ''f''(''x'') is "S-unimodal" (often referred to as "S-unimodal map") if its [[Schwarzian derivative]] is negative for all &lt;math&gt;\ x \ne  c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the critical point.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite news|title=Distortion of S-Unimodal Maps|authors=John Guckenheimer and Stewart Johnson|journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Second Series|volume=132|number=1|date=July 1990|pages=71–130|doi=10.2307/1971501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational geometry]] if a function is unimodal it permits the design of efficient algorithms for finding the extrema of the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Godfried T. Toussaint|title=Complexity, convexity, and unimodality|journal=International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences|volume=13|number=3|date=June 1984|pages=197–217|doi=10.1007/bf00979872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more general definition, applicable to a function f(X) of a vector variable X is that f is unimodal if there is a one-to-one differentiable mapping
''X'' = ''G''(''Z'') such that ''f''(''G''(''Z'')) is convex.  Usually one would want ''G''(''Z'') to be continuously differentiable with nonsingular Jacobian matrix.

[[Quasiconvex function]]s and quasiconcave functions extend the concept of unimodality to functions whose arguments belong to higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s.

'''''Via media''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "the middle road" and is a philosophical [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] for life which advocates moderation in all thoughts and actions.

Originating from early [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], where [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) taught [[moderation]], urging his students to follow the middle road between extremes, the ''via media'' was the dominant philosophical [[precept]] by which [[Ancient Roman]] civilisation and society was organised.

{{Main|Erasmus}}

==Anglicanism==
The term ''via media'' is frequently applied to the [[Anglican]] churches, though not without debate, as a term of [[apologetics]]. The idea of a middle way, between the Roman [[Catholics]] and the Magisterial Reformers, goes back to early in the [[Protestant Reformation]], when theologians such as [[Martin Bucer]], [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]] advocated a religious solution in which secular authority would hold the ring in the religious dispute, and ensure political stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Thomas Cranmer'' (1996), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Richard Hooker===
A recent scholarly study points out that, while [[Richard Hooker]]'s ''[[Law of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' has a reputation as "the classic depiction of the English ''via media'' based upon the sound triumvirate of scripture, reason and tradition", the actual term ''via media'' nowhere appears in the work (written in English).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brydon, ''The Evolving Reputation of Richard Hooker: An Examination of Responses 1600-1714'' (2006), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Tractarianism===
Three centuries later, the phrase was used by [[John Henry Newman]] in setting out his influential views on [[Anglicanism]], as part of the argument he brought forward with the [[Tractarian]] movement.
''Via Media'' was the title of a series of the ''Tracts for Today'', published by Newman around 1834. These tracts in particular used the title to pay homage to the inception of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and in so doing claim that the Tractarian movement was of the same vein as early Church of England scholars and theologians. They examined the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] and reinterpreted it as a compromise between Rome and Reform.

The Tractarians promoted the idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between the extremes of [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;Newman: Tract 38 ''Via Media I'': "The glory of the English Church is, that it has taken the VIA MEDIA, as it has been called. It lies between the (so called) Reformers and the Romanists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Newman: Tract 41 ''Via Media II'': "A number of distinct doctrines are included in the notion of Protestantism: and as to all these, our Church has taken the VIA MEDIA between it and Popery"&lt;/ref&gt; which became later an idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between Rome and Protestantism itself.

In justification of its idea of a ''via media'', the Oxford Movement attributed this position to the works of the Elizabethan theologian [[Richard Hooker]] and in particular his book ''Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity'', which is accepted as a founding work on Anglican theology, a view of Hooker promoted by [[John Keble]], who was one of the first to argue that English theology underwent such a "decisive change" in Hooker’s hands.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Atkinson: [http://www.churchsociety.org/crossway/documents/Cway_060_AtkinsonHooker1.pdf Richard Hooker – Reformed Theologian of the English Church] - The Church Society, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Hooker does not use the phrase "''via media''" or "middle way" or the word "Anglican" in any of his works; the attribution of ''via media'' to him is much later. Hooker's work concerned the form of [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] church government as an argument against the extreme advocates of [[Puritan]]ism, arguing that elements of Church of England practice condemned by the Puritans, in particular the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the institution of [[bishop]]s, are proper and accord with Scripture. Later theologians analysed Hooker's approach to the particular doctrine of justification by faith as a middle way between the [[predestination]]ism of the extreme Calvinists and [[Lutheran]] and [[Arminian]] doctrines.

The Oxford Movement recast this ''via media'' as a middle way not within Protestantism but between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Its application to early Anglicanism has remained current in Anglican discourse.

The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name="Moradian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society |last=Moradian |first=Azad |work=Tolerancy.org |publisher=[[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology]] |date=10 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230632/http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176%3A2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43%3Aevents-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by "individuals" as well as "states". Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are: [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[reproductive coercion]], [[female infanticide]], [[sex selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]], [[obstetric violence]], and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. Some forms of violence are perpetrated or condoned by the state such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Director) | title = Violence Against Women.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem, 1, 1-3 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = July 1997 | access-date = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level, through instruments such as conventions; or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s, such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF |format=pdf | date = September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the directive against [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF |format=pdf |title= Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women:&lt;ref name="COE 210"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210 |title=Details of Treaty No.210: Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"violence against women" is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life}}

Although the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) includes VAW in its General Recommendations 12 and 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/ |title=General recommendations adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW at paragraph 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 July 1993 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=UN General Assembly |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the 1993 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], which became the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards |title=What We Do: Ending Violence against Women: Global Norms and Standards |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are provided by the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html |title=Inter-American Convention On The Prevention, Punishment And Eradication Of Violence Against Women "Convention Of Belem Do Para" |publisher=Organization of American States |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richters | first = J.M.

In ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2002 |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 |format=PDF |title=Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence |publisher=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages;

:b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

:c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

:d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory and problematic. These definitions are conceptualized in an understanding of society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ertürk | first = Yakin | title = Towards a post-patriarchal gender order: confronting the universality and the particularity of violence against women | journal = Sociologisk Forskning | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;70 | publisher = Sveriges Sociologförbund [Swedish Sociological Association] | jstor = 20853687 | date = 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way may introduce notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | title = Violence against women: a field study | journal = [[Economic and Political Weekly]] | volume = 35 | issue = 20 | pages = 1742&amp;ndash;1751 | publisher = Sameeksha Trust, Mumbai, India | jstor = 4409296 | date = 13 May 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Michau | first = Lori | title = Approaching old problems in new ways: community mobilisation as a primary prevention strategy to combat violence against women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Development]], special issue: Gender-based Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 95&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/13552070601179144 | jstor = 20461184 | date = March 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/13552070601179144 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted current definition that covers all the dimensions of gender-based violence rather than the one for women that tends to reproduce the concept of binary oppositions: masculinity versus femininity.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"/&gt;

The history of violence against women remains vague in scientific literature. This is in part because many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Cathy | title = Violence against women: global scope and magnitude | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | pages = 1232&amp;ndash;1237 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955557 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle to forming a clear picture of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

Although the history of violence against women is difficult to track, it is clear that much of the violence was accepted, condoned and even legally sanctioned.&lt;ref name="Film script"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=Patricia | title=No Safe Place: Violence Against Women (script) |url=https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/script/script.html|publisher=[[PBS]] documentary |date =1996|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include that Roman law gave men the right to chastise their wives, even to the point of death,&lt;ref name="Roman Law"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stedman | first = Berne | title = Right of husband to chastise wife | journal = [[Virginia Law Review|The Virginia Law Register]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 241&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = [[University of Virginia School of Law]] | doi = 10.2307/1106112 | jstor = 1106112 | date = August 1917 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1106112 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available at [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/valrgn3&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline].

The history of violence against women is closely related to the historical view of women as property and a gender role of subservience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Toren | first = Christina | chapter = Transforming love: representing Fijian hierarchy | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KGXezlZnjF8C&amp;pg=PA36 | editor-last1 = Harvey | editor-first1 = Penelope | editor-last2= Gow | editor-first2 = Peter  | title = Sex and violence: issues in representation and experience | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415057349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of [[patriarchy]] and an overall world system or status quo in which gender inequalities exist and are perpetuated are cited to explain the scope and history of violence against women.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women | id = A/RES/48/104 | url = https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Addressing gender-based violence: advancing human rights | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021001255/http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | archive-date = 21 October 2014 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN, "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women's freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Several forms of violence are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, often in [[developing countries]]. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Cambodia]]. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Female genital mutilation]] is found mostly in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. (Also see [[lobolo]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Papua New Guinea: police cite bride price major factor in marital violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150218182845/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | archive-date = 18 February 2015 |url= http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | work = Island Business |via=Violence is not our Culture |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An exploratory study of bride price and domestic violence in Bundibugyo District, Uganda | url= http://www.mrc.ac.za/gender/Bridepricedomesticviolence.pdf | publisher = Centre for Human Rights Advancement (CEHURA) and [[South African Medical Research Council]] | date =April 2012 | accessdate =6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain regions are no longer associated with a specific form of violence, but such violence was common until quite recently in those places; this is true of honor-based crimes in Southern/Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirti | first1 = Anand | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Prateek | last3 = Yadav | first3 = Rachana | title = The face of honour based crimes: global concerns and solutions | journal = International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 343&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = South Asian Society of Criminology &amp; Victimology (SASCV) | date = 2011 | url = http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/kirtietalicjs2011i&amp;iind.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Italy]], before 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances in case of a killing of a woman or her sexual partner for reasons related to honor, providing for a reduced sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barazzetti | first1 = Donatella | last2 = Garreffa | first2 = Franca | last3 = Marsico | first3 = Rosaria | title = Daphne Project "Proposing new indicators: measuring violence's effects, GVEI (Gender Violence Effects Indicators)" | url = http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf | publisher = Centre Women’s Studies “Milly Villa”, [[University of Calabria]] | location = Rende, Italy | date = July 2007 | quote = Before 1981, Art. 587 read: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invoking culture to explain particular forms of violence against women risks appearing to legitimize them. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, as well as various interpretations of religion, interact with abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narayan | first = Uma | chapter = Cross‐cultural connections, border‐crossings, and "Death by Culture": thinking about dowry-murders in India and domestic‐violence murders in the United States | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lzQ49LnmL_cC&amp;pg=PA81 | editor-last = Narayan | editor-first = Uma | title = Dislocating cultures: identities, traditions, and Third-World feminism | pages = 81&amp;ndash;118 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415914192 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some states and social groups within many countries claiming to defend their traditions. These justifications are questionable precisely because the defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The need for sensitivity and respect of culture is an element that cannot be ignored either; thus a sensitive debate has ensued and is ongoing.

There has also been a history of recognizing the harmful effects of this violence. In the 1870s, courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calvert | first = Robert | chapter = Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fCpHAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Steinmetz | editor-first1 = Suzanne | editor-last2 = Straus | editor-first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Jackson [1891]. 1 Q.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Corporal punishment | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] | edition = 11th | year = 1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, and in particular since the 1990s, there has been increased activity on both the national and international levels to research, raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of all kinds of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a violation of human rights. A study in 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lives, and "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;

Certain characteristics of violence against women have emerged from the research. For example, acts of violence against women are often not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time. More often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; The research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

===Milestones===
Some of the most important milestones on the international level for the prevention of violence against women include:

*The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which recognizes violence as a part of discrimination against women in recommendations 12 and 19.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global norms and standards: Ending violence against women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards|publisher=[[UN Women]]|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recognized violence against women as a human rights violation, and which contributed to the following UN declaration.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards" /&gt;
*The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] was the first international instrument explicitly defining and addressing violence against women. This document specifically refers to the historically forever-present nature of gender inequalities in understanding violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; (Include current 2nd paragraph here). This Declaration, as well as the World Conference of the same year, is often viewed as a "turning point" at which the consideration of violence against women by the international community began to be taken much more seriously, and after which more countries mobilized around this problem.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venis | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Horton | first2 = Richard | title = Violence against women: a global burden | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | page = 1172 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955533 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | date = 6 April 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study"&gt;{{cite book | last = Garcia-Moreno | first = Claudia | title = WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women: initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2005 | url = http://cdrwww.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf | isbn = 9789241593588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]], linking violence against women to reproductive health and rights, and also providing recommendations to governments on how to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;
*In 1996, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) declared violence a major public health issue, and included in the subtypes recognized were intimate partner violence and sexual violence, two kinds of violence often perpetrated as violence against women.

*In 1999, the UN adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and designated [[November 25]] as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; 
*In 2002, as a follow-up of the WHA declaration in 1996 of violence as a major public health issue, the [[World Health Organization]] published the first World Report on Violence and Health, which addressed many types of violence and their effect on public health, including forms of violence affecting women particularly strongly. The report specifically noted the sharp rise in civil society organizations and activities directed at responding to gender-based violence against women from the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt; 
*In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published its "Multi-country study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women", a study of women's health and [[domestic violence]] by surveying over 24,000 women in 10 countries from all regions of the world, which assessed the prevalence and extent of violence against women, particularly violence by intimate partners, and linked this with health outcomes to women as well as documenting strategies and services that women use to cope with intimate-partner violence.&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study" /&gt;

Additionally, on the national level, individual countries have also organized efforts (legally, politically, socially) to prevent, reduce and punish violence against women. As a particular case study, here are some developments since the 1960s in the United States to oppose and treat violence against women:&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women (OVM)|title=The History of the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017204719/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1967: One of the country's first domestic violence shelters opened in Maine.
*1972: The country's first rape help hotline opened in Washington, D.C.
*1978: Two national coalitions, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]], were formed, to raise awareness of these two forms of violence against women.
*1984: The U.S. Attorney General created the Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence, to address ways in which the criminal justice system and community response to domestic violence should be improved.
*1994: Passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] or VAWA, legislation included in the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden, which required a strengthened community response to crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault, strengthened federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and strengthened legislative protection of victims, among many other provisions.
*2000: President Clinton signed into law the VAWA of 2000, further strengthening federal laws, and emphasizing assistance of immigrant victims, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and victims of dating violence.
*2006: President Bush signed into law the VAWA of 2006, with an emphasis on programs to address violence against youth victims, and establishing programs for Engaging Men and Youth, and Culturally and Linguistically Specific Services.
*2007: The National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline opened.
*2009: President Obama declared April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
*2013: President Obama signed into law the VAWA of 2015, which granted Native American tribes the ability to prosecute non-Native offenders, and regulated reports of sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohlman | first = Cindy | title = Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) New Reporting Requirements Effective July 1, 2015 – Are You Ready? | url = https://www.inceptia.org | publisher = Inceptia Institute | date = 9 June 2015 }}

Other countries have also enacted comparable legislative, political and social instruments to address violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe, however, that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fawole | first1 = Olufunmilayo I. | last2 = Ajuwon | first2 = Ademola J. | last3 = Osungbade | first3 = Kayode O. | last4 = Faweya | first4 = Olufemi C. | title = Interventions for violence prevention among young female hawkers in motor parks in South-Western Nigeria: a review of effectiveness | journal = [[African Journal of Reproductive Health]] [La Revue Africaine de la Santé Reproductive] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 71&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) | doi = 10.2307/3583347 | jstor = 3583347 | date = April 2003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date = 1 September 2011|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on society==
[[File:Map3.1NEW Womens Physical Security 2011 compressed.jpg|thumb|A map of the world showing countries by level of women's physical security, 2011]]
According to an article in the [[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights Journal]],&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and political development of their communities.&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt; Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially influences their lives so that they are impeded to exercise their human rights; for instance, they fear contributing to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. Apart from that, the causes that trigger VAW or gender-based violence can go beyond just the issue of gender and into the issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and specific geographical area of their origins.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the public health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colarossi | first = Lisa | title = A response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What guides social work knowledge about violence against women? | journal = Journal of Social Work Education | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 147&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] on behalf of the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) | doi = 10.517/FJSWE.2005.200400418 | jstor = 23044038 | date = Winter 2005 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }}

Women who have HIV/AIDS infection are also among the targets of the violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on health care services, as women who have suffered violence are more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet" /&gt; Another statement that confirms an understanding of VAW as being a significant health issue is apparent in the recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe, violence against women in private sphere, at home or [[domestic violence]], is the main reason of "death and disability" among the women who encountered violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}}

In addition, several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence. These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maffly | first = Brian | title = BYU study links women's safety, nation's peace | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080318/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | archive-date = 2 February 2010 | url = http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | work = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strearmer | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Emmett | first2 = Chad F.|url=http://www.womanstats.org/images/StearmerEmmettAPSA07.pdf |title=The great divide: Revealing differences in the Islamic world regarding the status of women and its impact on international peace |publisher= [[WomanStats Project]] |date=2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}} Paper prepared for presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Political Science Association]], Chicago, Illinois, August 29–September 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women's rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women's rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the "[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]" that implies "political will towards addressing VAW " and the legal binding agreement, "the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rosche | first1 = Daniela | last2 = Dawe | first2 = Alexandra | title = Oxfam Briefing Note: Ending violence against women the case for a comprehensive international action plan |page=2 | publisher = [[Oxfam|Oxfam GB]] | location = Oxford | year = 2013 | url = http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bn-ending-violence-against-women-action-plan-220213-en.pdf | isbn = 9781780772639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the UN General Assembly resolution also designated 25 November as [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |date= 17 December 1999|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Another typology: over time ===
[[File:Typology of Violence Against Women over Time.png|thumbnail|300 px|A diagram of typology of violence against women over time, as conceived by authors Charlotte Watts &amp; Cathy Zimmerman.]]

This similar typology from an academic journal article on violence against women shows similarly the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women's life the violence takes place.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.

==Types==
Violence against women can take a number of forms:

===Rape===
{{main|Rape}}
Rape is a type of [[sexual assault]], usually involving [[sexual intercourse]]. Rape is usually perpetrated by men against boys, women, and girls; women are usually assaulted more often than boys and girls and usually all by someone they know.

Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 varied between 0.1 in [[Egypt]] per 100,000 people and 91.6 per 100,000 people in [[Lesotho]] with 4.9 per 100,000 people in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses | url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls | format = spreadsheet | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most underreported violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = AMA | author-link = American Medical Association | title = Strategies for the treatment and prevention of sexual assault | publisher = [[American Medical Association]] | location = Chicago, Illinois | year = 1995 | oclc = 33901581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Liz | last2 = Regan | first2 = Linda | last3 = Lovett | first3 = Jo | author-link = Liz Kelly | title = A gap or a chasm?: Attrition in reported rape cases | publisher = Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate | location = London | id = 293 | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781844735556 | archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | archivedate = 18 February 2011 | url = http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all | accessdate = 31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by persons the victim knows.&lt;ref&gt;''Relevant citations'':

====Violence against victims====
Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in many cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]]. Victims may also be forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".&lt;ref&gt;''Relevant articles'':

===Marital rape===
{{Main|Marital rape}}
Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex perpetrated by the victim's spouse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of marital rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.

In [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;{{cite book | last = Grady | first = William | title = Crime in Canadian context: debates and controversies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195433784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brennan | first1 = Shannon| last2 = Taylor-Butts | first2 = Andrea | title = Sexual assault in Canada, 2004 | publisher = Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics | location = Ottawa | year = 2008 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf | format = pdf | isbn = 9781100111636 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = SIECCAN |title=Sexual assault in Canada: what do we know? |publisher=The Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071229/http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | archive-date = 22 July 2014 |url=http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | date = October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] spousal rape was outlawed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Temkin86"&gt;{{cite book | last = Temkin | first = Jennifer | chapter = Defining and redefining rape | editor-last = Temkin | editor-first = Jennifer | title = Rape and the legal process | page = 86 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780198763543 }}

In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=R v R [1991&amp;#93; UKHL 12 (23 October 1991) |publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] marital rape was also made illegal in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zeegers | first = Nicolle | title = What epistemology would serve criminal law best in finding the truth about rape? | journal = Law and Method | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 60&amp;ndash;71 | date = January 2012 | url = http://www.lawandmethod.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last Western countries to criminalize marital rape was [[Germany]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kieler |first=Marita|date=2003|title=Tatbestandsprobleme der sexuellen Nötigung, Vergewaltigung sowie des sexuellen Mißbrauchs widerstandsunfähiger Personen|publisher=[[University of Osnabrück]] via Tenea | url = http://www.jurawelt.com/dissertationen/werke/8821|oclc=758907108}} [http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial. The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]], which is considered a [[sin]]) and states, "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.

===Domestic violence===

{{main|Domestic violence}}
Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "[[intimate partner violence]]" or (IPV). Instances of IPV tend not to be reported to police and thus many experts believe that the true magnitude of the problem is hard to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: fact sheet | url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211183916/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/ipvfacts.htm | archive-date = 11 February 2007 | website = cdc.gov/ncipc | publisher = National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2006 | accessdate = 4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are much more likely than men to be [[murdered]] by an intimate partner.

According to WHO, globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet" /&gt; A UN report compiled from a number of different studies conducted in at least 71 countries found domestic violence against women to be most prevalent in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ethiopian women are most abused | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6040180.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 11 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, a country that has received major international criticism for the way it has dealt legally with the issue of violence against women is [[Finland]]; with authors pointing that a high level of equality for women in the public sphere (as in Finland) should never be equated with equality in all other aspects of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | publisher = [[Tokiwa University]] via [[California State University|The Press at California State University]] | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | ref = harv | doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2008 |title=Case Closed: Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |publisher=Amnesty International |url=https://amnesty.dk/media/1557/case-closed.pdf | pages = 89–91 | quote = Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diagnosis planning====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s, which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref name="Personality"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = First | first1 = Michael B. | last2 = Bell | first2 = Carl C. | last3 = Cuthbert | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Krystal | first4 = John H. | last5 = Malison | first5 = Robert | last6 = Offord | first6 = David R. | last7 = Reiss | first7 = David | last8 = Shea | first8 = M.

Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage that is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|163}} In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}} The authors of this study add, "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalking|stalk]] and [[battery (crime)|batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} on the course of violent marriages, which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}}

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world. In honor killings, women and girls are killed by family members (usually husbands, fathers, uncles or brothers) because the women are believed to have brought shame or dishonor upon the family. These killings are a traditional practice, believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ethics guide – Honour crimes | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml | work = [[BBC]] | date = | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Definition of honor killing | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing | website = merriam-webster.com | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, attempting to leave a marriage, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways that are deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harter | first = Pascale | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | publisher= [[BBC News]] | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=14 June 2011| access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dowry violence====
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or a woman is abducted by the would be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

====Force-feeding====
In some countries, notably Mauritania, young girls are forcibly fattened to prepare them for marriage, because obesity is seen as desirable. This practice of [[force-feeding]] is known as ''[[leblouh]]'' or ''gavage''.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

====Abuse related to son-preference====

[[File:Chinese anti infanticide tract from 1800.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chinese anti-infanticide tract circa 1800. China has a long history of son preference, which was aggravated after the enforcement of the [[one child policy]].]]
''Son preference'' is a custom rooted in gender inequality that is prevalent in many countries and found across religions and classes.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Son preference | url =http://www.stopvaw.org/harmful_practices_son_preference | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women | date = June 2010 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although preference for a specific sex of the child may be common in an abstract way in many cultures, when such preference is so strong as to lead to the rejection of the child or to violence against the mother, this crosses the line into [[domestic violence]], [[child abuse]] and violence against women. Such forms of son preference are common especially in parts of [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Manifestations of such practices include [[sex selective abortion]], [[female infanticide]], [[child abandonment|female child abandonment]], as well as favoring sons with regard to allocating of family resources.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son" /&gt;

[[China]] and [[India]] have a very strong son preference. In China, the [[one child policy]] was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio. Sex-selective abortion, as well as rejection of girl children is common. [[The Dying Rooms]] is a 1995 [[television]] [[documentary film]] about Chinese state orphanages, which documented how parents abandoned their newborn girls into [[orphanages]], where the staff would leave the children in rooms to die of thirst, or starvation.
Another manifestation of son preference is the violence inflicted against mothers who give birth to girls.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

Reproductive coercion is violent, manipulative or deceptive behavior against [[reproductive health]] or [[reproductive rights]] within an intimate relation and includes a collection of behaviors intended to lead to [[forced pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="ACOG"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women | title = Committee Opinion No. 554: Reproductive and Sexual Coercion | journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics and Gynecology]] | volume = 121 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 411&amp;ndash;415 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|LWW]] | pmid = 23344307 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000426427.79586.3b | date = February 2013 | url = https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion is a form of [[domestic violence]], also known as [[intimate partner violence]], where behavior concerning reproductive health is used to maintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over a partner through an unwanted pregnancy.

Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discourse on reproductive rights, the issue of [[abortion]] is often debated. [[Abortion law]] falls within the jurisdiction of each country, although [[forced abortion]] is prohibited by international law. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced abortion and [[forced sterilization]] (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CoE | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = 12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of ''forced continuation of pregnancy'' (i.e. denying a woman safe and legal abortion) is also seen by some organizations as a violation of women's rights, although there are no binding international obligations on this issue. However, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states, "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, ''criminalisation of abortion'', ''denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care'', ''forced continuation of pregnancy'', abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | author-link = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women#Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | publisher = [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) | id = CEDAW/C/GC/35 | date = 14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating abuse===
{{See|Dating abuse|Teen dating violence}}
Dating abuse or dating violence is the perpetration of coercion, intimidation or assault in the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[abusive power and control]]. Dating violence is defined by the CDC as "the physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship, including stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: teen dating violence | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html | website = cdc.gov | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2016 | accessdate = 21 October 2017}} [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/teen-dating-violence-factsheet-a.pdf Fact sheet pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is common for older men to engage in "compensated dating" with underage girls. Such relationships are called [[enjo kōsai]] in Japan, and are also common in Asian countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong. The WHO condemned "economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with “sugar daddies” in return for school fees)" as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW" /&gt;

===Sexual violence on college campuses===

===Restrictions on freedom of movement===
Women are, in many parts of the world, severely restricted in their [[freedom of movement]].
Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  UN General Assembly | author-link =  UN General Assembly | title = The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326154350/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | archive-date = 26 March 2014 | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | publisher = [[UN Women|UN Women, Division for the Advancement of Women]] | date = 1979 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some countries, women are not legally allowed to leave home without a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] (male relative or husband).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Dave | title = Saudi Arabian woman challenges male guardianship laws | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13932287 | work = [[BBC World Service]] | date = 29 June 2011 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries where there are no laws against women traveling alone, there are strong social norms, such as [[purdah]] - a religious and social practice of female [[seclusion]] prevalent especially among some [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] communities in [[South Asia]]. Many countries have laws on what type of clothing women may or may not wear in public (see [[Hijab by country]]). Women in some cultures are forced into [[social isolation]] during their [[menstruation|menstrual period]]s. In parts of Nepal for instance, they are forced to live in sheds, are forbidden to touch men or even to enter the courtyard of their own homes, and are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and various other foods, for fear they will contaminate those goods. (see [[Chhaupadi]]). Women have died during this period because of starvation, bad weather, or bites by snakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

===Denial of medical care===
[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maternal Mortality Rate]] worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causes.&lt;ref name=CIA2010&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html?countryName=Australia&amp;countryCode=as&amp;regionCode=aus&amp;rank=156#as Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]]. Date of Information: 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Women in many parts of the world are often denied medical care. Denial of access to 
health assistance, along with denial of access to other services, is a form of socioeconomic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/images/zdocs/gl_sgbv03_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO, "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may be denied medical care for numerous reasons, including lack of necessary [[freedom of movement]] allowing women to leave home so they can go to a medical facility, lack of financial resources, the need (in law or in practice) for a male relative or husband to consent to the medical care of the woman. A common consequence of denial of women's medical care is [[maternal mortality]]. Globally, there are more than 300.000 cases of maternal mortality yearly, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system  for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]]. In some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E.

===Stalking===
{{Main|Stalking}}
Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person, often manifested through persistent [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], or following/monitoring of the victim. Stalking is often understood as "course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-information |title=Stalking information |website =victimsofcrime.org | publisher = Stalking Resource Center |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stalkers are frequently portrayed as being strangers, they are most often known people, such as former or current partners, friends, colleagues or acquaintances. In the U.S., a survey by NVAW found that only 23% of female victims were stalked by strangers.&lt;ref name="victimsofcrime.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarlane | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = Jacquelyn C. | last3 = Wilt | first3 = Susan | last4 = Sachs | first4 = Carolyn J. | last5 = Ulrich | first5 = Yvonne | last6 = Xu | first6 = Xiao | title = Stalking and intimate partner femicide | journal = [[Homicide Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 300&amp;ndash;316 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1088767999003004003 | date = November 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1088767999003004003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/mcfarlane-j-m-campbell-j-c-wilt-s-sachs-c-j-ulrich-y-xu-x-1999.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking by partners can be very dangerous, as sometimes it can escalate into severe violence, including murder.&lt;ref name="victimsofcrime.org"/&gt; Police statistics from the 1990s in Australia indicated that 87.7% of stalking offenders were male and 82.4% of stalking victims were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dussuyer |first=Inez |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/stalking/dussuyer.pdf |format=pdf |title=Is stalking legislation effective in protecting victims? |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Criminology]] |location=Sydney |date=December 2000 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052637/http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/stalking/dussuyer.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} Paper presented at the ''Stalking: Criminal Justice Responses Conference'' convened by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] and held in Sydney 7–8 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, which may include [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature, or the inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf |format=pdf |title=What is sexual harassment |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=3 April 2016}}

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] defines sexual harassment as: "any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment".&lt;ref name="COE 210" /&gt;

===Human trafficking and forced prostitution===
[[File:Map3.3Trafficking compressed.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A world map showing countries by prevalence of female trafficking]]
{{Main|Human trafficking|Forced prostitution}}
Human trafficking refers to the acquisition of persons by improper means such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of [[Exploitation of labour|exploiting]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = UNODC| author-link =United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/human-trafficking/index.html?ref=menuside |title=UNODC on human trafficking and migrant smuggling (index) |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] |date= |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = OSCE | author-link = OSCE|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/19223 |title=U.N. protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.

[[Forced prostitution]] is [[prostitution]] that takes place as a result of [[coercion]] by a third party.

A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Owen | first = Margaret | chapter = Human rights, equality and legal protection | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bh8sGfNKUTEC&amp;pg=PA181 | editor-last = Owen | editor-first = Margaret | title = A world of widows | publisher = Zed Books | location = London Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey | year = 1996 | isbn = 9781856494205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of widows (such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]]) has been prevalent historically in various cultures (especially in [[India]]). Although sati in India is today an almost defunct practice, isolated incidents have occurred in recent years, such as the 1987 sati of [[Roop Kanwar]], as well as several incidents in rural areas in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2178102.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Arrests in Indian ritual burning | date=7 August 2002 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5366506.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Sons arrested in sati death probe | date=21 September 2006 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those likely to be accused and killed as [[Modern witch-hunts|witche]]s are often widows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21725040-law-criminalising-sorcery-was-only-repealed-2013-gruesome-fate-witches-papua-new|title=The gruesome fate of “witches” in Papua New Guinea|publisher=economist.com |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Africa, such as in Kenya, widows are viewed as impure and need to be 'cleansed'. This often requires having sex with someone. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman's children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-10-23/these-kenyan-widows-are-fighting-against-sexual-cleansing|title=These Kenyan widows are fighting against sexual 'cleansing'|publisher=pri.org|accessdate=7 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow inheritance (also known as bride inheritance) is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a male relative of her late husband, often his brother.

[[Witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America.

Militarism produces special environments that allow for increased violence against women.

War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power. During World War II the Japanese military established brothels filled with "[[comfort women]]", girls and women who were forced into sexual slavery for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title=Why soldiers rape |work=[[In These Times]] |date=14 August 2008 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morris-Suzuki | first = Tessa | title = Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth (in the ordinary, everyday sense of the word) | journal = Japan Focus (The Asia-Pacific Journal) | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/2373  |accessdate=4 August 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another example of violence against women incited by militarism during war took place in the [[Kaunas Ghetto|Kovno Ghetto]].

Rape was committed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] by members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and the [[militia]]s that supported them. Over a period of nine months, hundreds of thousands of women were raped. [[Susan Brownmiller]], in her report on the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]], said that girls from the age of eight to grandmothers of seventy-five suffered attacks. {{See also|Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War}}

Rape used as a weapon of war was practiced during the [[Bosnian War]] where rape was used as a highly systematized instrument of war by Serb armed forces predominantly targeting women and girls of the Bosniak ethnic group for physical and moral destruction. Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range from 50,000 to 60,000; as of 2010 only 12 cases have been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNSC | author-link = United Nations Security Council | title = Report of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991 | id = A/52/375{{spaces|2}}S/1997/729 | publisher = [[United Nations Security Council]] |url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804004034/http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2012 | date = 18 September 1997 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|Rape during the Bosnian War}}

====Stoning and flogging====
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Batha | first = Emma | title = FACTBOX: Stoning - where does it happen? | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125051613/http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | archive-date = 25 January 2016 | url = http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] | date = 29 September 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flogging]] or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including [[sex outside marriage]]. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lang | first = Olivia | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 February 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamali |first=Hasan |url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.UolafidedO6 |title=Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |date= |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JdMstMvl?url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Female genital mutilation (factsheet) |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= June 2000 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF | title = Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = 22 July 2013 | accessdate = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO states: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths" and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"/&gt; According to a UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (96 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

According to some local practitioners, it is believed that FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs. It is considered to be a traditional practice that continues to take place in different communities/countries of Africa and Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. FGM is defined as a "harmful traditional practice"&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shell-Duncan | first = Bettina | title = From health to human rights: female genital cutting and the politics of intervention | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 225&amp;ndash;236 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | date = June 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance to the Inter-African Committee.

As of 2016, in [[Africa]], FGM has been legally banned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

There exist several approaches that were set up by international health organizations and civil societies (for example, [[Tostan]]) aimed at eliminating the practice of FGM in implemented countries: 
# FGM as a Health issue (also known as health risks approach)
# FGM as a Human Rights issue (also known as Human Rights-based approach)

Some scholars suggests that, when dealing with FGM, it is necessary to take lessons from history, particularly 19th-century campaign against [[foot-binding]] in China,&lt;ref name="Kwame Appiah"&gt;{{cite news | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony | author-link = Kwame Anthony Appiah | title = The art of social change | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?pagewanted=all |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was successful.

===Obstetric violence===
{{See|Abuse during childbirth}}
"Obstetric violence" refers to acts categorized as physically or psychologically violent in the context of labor and birth. In most developed and many [[developing countries]], birth takes place in an increasingly medicalized environment; with numerous surgical interventions that the pregnant woman can sometimes be coerced into accepting, or which are done without her consent, or which are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Habek | first1 = Dubravko | last2 = Vuković Bobić | first2 = Mirna | last3 = Hrgović | first3 = Zlatko | title = Possible feto-maternal clinical risk of the Kristeller’s expression | journal = [[Central European Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;6 | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | doi = 10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Care in normal birth: a practical guide | id = WHO/FRH/MSM/96.24 | url = http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/who_frh_msm_9624/en/ | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | series = Safe Motherhood Practical Guide | year = 1996 | access-date = 2 December 2013}} [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/63167/1/WHO_FRH_MSM_96.24.pdf Pdf.]

Many such practices originate in patriarchal ideologies. The WHO stated: "in normal birth, there should be a valid reason to interfere with the natural process.

=== Violence against indigenous women ===
Indigenous women around the world are often targets of sexual assault or physical violence. Many indigenous communities are rural, with few resources and little help from the government or non-state actors. These groups also often have strained relationships with law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. Many indigenous societies also find themselves at the center of land disputes between nations and ethnic groups, often resulting in these communities bearing the brunt of national and ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = UNFPA | last2 = UNICEF | last3 = UN Women | last4 = ILO | last5 = Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (OSRSG/VAC) | author-link1 = United Nations Population Fund | author-link2 = UNICEF | author-link3 = UN Women | author-link4 = International Labour Organization | title = Breaking the silence on violence against indigenous girls, adolescents and young women: A call to action based on an overview of existing evidence from Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America | url = http://www.unfpa.org/resources/breaking-silence-violence-against-indigenous-girls-adolescents-and-young-women | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} [https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/VAIWG_FINAL.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence against indigenous women is often perpetrated by the state, such as in [[Peru]], in the 1990s. President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a [[forced sterilization]] program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 24 July 2002 | access-date = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented 28 July 1995.

[[Guatemala]]n indigenous women have also faced extensive violence. Throughout over three decades of conflict, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] women and girls have continued to be targeted. The Commission for Historical Clarification found that 88% of women affected by state-sponsored rape and sexual violence against women were indigenous.

The concept of white dominion over indigenous women's bodies has been rooted in American history since the beginning of colonization. The theory of manifest destiny went beyond simple land extension and into the belief that European settlers had the right to exploit Native women's bodies as a method of taming and "humanizing" them.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = Bubar | last2 = Jumper Thurman | first2 = Pamela | title = Violence against native women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 70&amp;ndash;86 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768276 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=roe-bubar-and-pamela-jumper-thurman-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramirez | first = Renya | title = Healing, violence, and Native American women | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Native Women and State Violence | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 103&amp;ndash;116 | publisher = Social Justice | jstor = 29768279 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=renya-ramirez-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] and economic inequality of indigenous Canadians has resulted in communities facing violence, unemployment, drug use, alcoholism, political corruption, and high rates of suicide.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; In addition, there has been clear and admitted racism towards indigenous people by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], making victims less likely to report cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |title=Top Mountie Admits Racism in Ranks towards Indigenous People |work=[[Aboriginal People's Television Network]] |date=9 December 2015 |url=http://aptn.ca/news/2015/12/09/top-mountie-admits-racism-in-ranks-towards-indigenous-people/ | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the issues facing indigenous women in Canada have been addressed via the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) initiatives. Thousands of Native Canadian women have gone missing or been killed in the past 30 years, with little representation or attention from the government. Efforts to make the Canadian public aware of these women's disappearances have mostly been led by Aboriginal communities, who often reached across provinces to support one another. In 2015, prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] commented that the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women was "not high on our radar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full Text of Peter Mansbridge's interview with Stephen Harper | work = [[CBC News]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2105-full-text-of-peter-mansbridge-s-interview-with-stephen-harper-1.3218399 | date = 7 September 2015 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting outrage in already frustrated indigenous communities. A few months later, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] launched an official inquiry into the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women.

In the United States, Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence than any other demographic.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; One in three Native women is sexually assaulted during her life, and over 85% of these assaults are perpetrated by non-Natives.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chekuru | first = Kavitha | title = Sexual violence scars Native American Women | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/03/201334111633172507.html | work = [[Al Jazeera]] | date = 6 March 2013 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disproportionate rate of assault to indigenous women is due to a variety of causes, including but not limited to the legal inability of tribes to prosecute perpetrators who are not tribal members. Tribes currently cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Natives. In theory, tribes can send cases to the federal level in order to prosecute non-Natives, but the majority of these cases are thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Zaykowski| first2 = Heather | last3 = Kallmyer | first3 = Rachel | last4 = Poteyeva | first4 = Margarita | last5 = Lanier | first5 = Christina | title = Violence against American Indian and Alaska native women and the criminal justice response: what is known | publisher = [[National Institute of Justice]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=245615 | date = August 2008 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} {{NCJ|245615}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, many reservations have become popular destinations for rapists and serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gettys | first = Travis | title = Outsiders have been raping Native American women with ‘impunity’ — but legal loophole may finally close | url = https://www.rawstory.com/2015/04/outsiders-have-been-raping-native-american-women-with-impunity-but-legal-loophole-may-finally-close/ | work = [[The Raw Story]] | date = 6 April 2015 | access-date = 10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple versions of the Violence Against Women Act have attempted to address this issue, but these sections have often been removed from official versions of the act.

===Violence against immigrant and refugee women===
Immigrant and refugee women often face violence, both in the private sphere (by partners and other family members) and in the public sphere (by the police and other authorities). These women are often in a vulnerable position: they do not speak the language of the country they are in, they do not know its laws, and sometimes they are in a legal position where they may be deported if they make contact with the authorities. Women who seek protection from armed conflict in their countries of origin often face more violence while travelling to the destination country or when they arrive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Jane | title = Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee "crisis" | journal = [[Reproductive Health Matters]], special issue – Violence: A Barrier to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights | volume = 24 | issue = 47 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | pmid = 27578335 | date = 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robbers | first1 = Gianna | last2 = Gunta | first2 = Lazdane | last3 = Dinesh | first3 = Sethi | title = Sexual violence against refugee women on the move to and within Europe | journal = [[Entre Nous (journal)|Entre Nous]], special issue: Together for a Better Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health | volume = 84 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;29 | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | date = 2016 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/319301/Entre-Nous-84-full-book.pdf?ua=1 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport-related===

Sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are "perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106162130/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] "have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

Sport-related violence can occur in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

====Sport-related violence by male college athletes====

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community. From the 2010 UVA lacrosse murder, in which a male athlete was charged guilty with second degree murder of his girlfriend, to the 2004 University of Colorado Football Scandal when players were charged with nine alleged sexual assaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Kevin|title=Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault Read more: Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault|url=http://www.denverpost.com/firstinthepost/ci_12557039|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies suggest that athletes are at higher risk for committing sexual assault against women than the average student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Brady (reporter)|title=Scandal Returns to University of Colorado Football|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381707|work=[[Weekend Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandler1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Steve B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Dewayne J.|last3=Carroll|first3=Pamela S.|title=Abusive behaviors of college athletes | journal = [[College Student Journal]] | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 638&amp;ndash;645 | publisher = [[University of South Alabama]] | date = 1 December 1999 | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/193500507 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that one in three college assaults are committed by athletes.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mak|first=Stephanie|title=Are athletes more abusive than the rest of the student population?|url=http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|journal=Hopkins Undergraduate Research Journal Online|accessdate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229044851/http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|archivedate=29 February 2012|date=2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that male student athletes who represent 3.3% of the college population, commit 19% of reported sexual assaults and 35% of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff writer|title=Game stats|publisher=The National Coalition Against Violent Athletes (NCVA)|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117092517/http://www.ncava.org/statistics.html|archivedate=17 November 2016|url=http://www.ncava.org:80/statistics.html|df=dmy-all}}

====Controversy over contributing factors====

Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports' locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team's subculture.&lt;ref name=Curry1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis Of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135 |url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name=Curry1991/&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room. In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she reflected, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name="Disch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have claimed that they often brush off the players' comments, which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt; Other sociologists challenge this claim. Steve Chandler notes that because of their celebrity status on campus, "athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes."&lt;ref name="chandler1999"/&gt; Another contender, Stephanie Mak, notes that, "if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Response to violence by male college athletes====

In response to the proposed link between college athletes and gender-based violence, and media coverage holding Universities as responsible for these scandals more universities are requiring athletes to attend workshops that promote awareness. For example, St. John's University holds sexual assault awareness classes in the fall for its incoming student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=John|title=Share on emailShare on redditMore Sharing Services Few Colleges Tackle Issue of Athlete Sex Assaults|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-22/news/mn-7249_1_sexual-assault|publisher=Los Angeles Times Online |date=22 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups, such as the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, have formed to provide support for the victims as their mission statement reads, "The NCAVA works to eliminate off the field violence by athletes through the implementation of prevention methods that recognize and promote the positive leadership potential of athletes within their communities. In order to eliminate violence, the NCAVA is dedicated to empowering individuals affected by athlete violence through comprehensive services including advocacy, education and counseling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|publisher=National Coalition Against Violent Athletes|accessdate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416074831/http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|archivedate=16 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to better comprehend the anti-violence movements against VAW, there is a need to also understand the generic historical background of [[feminist movements]] in a holistic manner. Talking about the international women's movement, many feminist scholars have categorized these movements into three waves&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kroløkke | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Ann Scott | chapter = Three waves of feminism: from suffragettes to grrls | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IEhqiWR1Rt0C&amp;pg=PA1 | editor-last1 = Kroløkke | editor-first1 = Charlotte | editor-last2 = Sørensen | editor-first2 = Ann Scott | title = Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance | pages = 1&amp;ndash;23 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780761929185 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to their different beliefs, strategies and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rupp | first1 = Leila J. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Verta | title = Forging feminist identity in an international movement: a collective identity approach to twentieth-century feminism | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;386 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/495344 | jstor = 3175646 | date = Winter 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/495344 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the first women's movements, or so called the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of feminism, dated back in the years the late 19th Century and early 20th Century in the United States and Europe. During this period, feminist movements developed from the context of industrialization and liberal politics that triggered the rise of feminist groups concerned with gaining equal access and opportunity for women.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|1}} This wave marks a period of "[[Women's suffrage|suffrage]], independence, rights to nationality, work and [[Gender pay gap|equal pay]]" for women.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Lecturer) | title = Violence Against Women.

The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of feminist movements was the series of movements from the period of the late 1960s to early 1970s. It was noted by feminist scholars that this wave could be characterized as a period of [[Women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] and the rise of a branch of feminism known as [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} This wave of feminism emerged in the context of the postwar period&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|8}} in society where other mainstream movements also played a large role; for instance, the [[civil rights movements]],&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; which meant to condemn [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and the oppression of people based on the notions of [[Racism|race]], ethnicity, [[gender identity]] and [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|9}} This wave marks a period of equal rights at home and workplace as well as rights to development&lt;ref name="Prügl, E.

The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism is the newest wave of feminism led by young feminists whose understanding and context are of the [[Globalization|globalized]] world order and the technological advances that have come with it. Also, this wave is a transition of the fall communism&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} to more complex issues of new kinds of 'warfare'{{Clarify|reason=What does this mean by "warfare"?  Also, this whole sentence is oddly worded but I don't understand what it's trying to say well enough to rewrite it.|date=November 2018}}, threats and violence. This new wave also "embraces ambiguity"&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and introduced a feminist approach of '[[intersectionality]]' that includes the issues of race, gender, age, and class.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Other than that, the third wave marks a period of feminism dealing with [[identity politics]], body politics as well as the issues of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lind | first = Amy (Lecturer) | title = Gender and International Affairs 2013: International Feminist Movements | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people/faculty/lind | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eng | first = Phoebe | author-link = Phoebe Eng | title = Stopping the violence against women: the movement from intervention to prevention | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf | format = pdf | page = 2 | publisher = [[Ms. Foundation for Women]] | location = New York | date = August 2005 | series = A Safety Program Report | access-date = 3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on 'gender issues'&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.

VAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325" /&gt; and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&amp;ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/4065347 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish "sanctuaries, shelters" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called "battered women", from acts of violence. The term "battered women" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop "innovative efforts" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88–89}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that "women's rights are human rights", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be "[[Western world|Western]] concepts" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&amp;ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}

=== Levels of activist movements ===

On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 95–109"/&gt; Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a "raising voices" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as "a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

A number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the "Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = [[Review of African Political Economy]], special issue: Violence and Conflict Resolution in Africa | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&amp;ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/03056249908704404 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

On an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called "[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]". This campaign "calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange"&gt;{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be "Orange Day" or "a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange" /&gt;

In conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: "1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights" - on the national policies "2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and "3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions" - on the international norms and agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===
On the global level:
* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown Thompson | first = Karen | chapter = Women's rights are human rights | editor-last1 = Khagram | editor-first1 = Sanjeev | editor-last2 = Riker | editor-first2 = James V. | editor-last3 = Sikkink | editor-first3 = Kathryn | title = Restructuring world politics: transnational social movements, networks, and norms | pages = 96&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816639076 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elman | first = R.

As before the other human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did not focus on the issue of VAW and did not consider rape and domestic violence as violations of human rights despite of the fact that they also have agenda on women's rights.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;
* The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=United Nations | date = 1995 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th Women Conference, VAW was emphasized and named as a critical concern. Also, the spillover effect was that this push highlighted the need for the development of "new international norms" that have often been used by activists and governments the proposition of legislation that provide other action to redress the acts of violence.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weldon, S.L 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Fábián | editor-first = Katalin | title = Domestic violence in postcommunist states: local activism, national policies, and global forces | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Indiana| year = 2010 | isbn = 9780253222183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subsequently, the push from the global feminist movement also push for the fully incorporation of the VAW issues into the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women" or [[CEDAW]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW |title=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the "original text of [[CEDAW]] in 1979 did not explicitly mention violence against women".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}}

On the regional level:
* ''Americas'': the Inter-American Convention on Violence Against Women, which was formally announced and adopted by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1994, immediately after the Vienna Conference&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Europe'': The [[European Union]] (EU)'s initiatives to combat violence against women after the 1990s: the 1997 resolution calling for a zero tolerance: specifically on UN human rights instruments of [[CEDAW]] and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration]].
** The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW: "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Africa'': 
** There emerged a series of regional meetings and agreements, which was triggered by the UN processes on the international level such as Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, 1985; the 1993 Kampala Prep Com; the 1994 Africa-wide UN women's conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili Mari | last2 = Casimiro | first2 = Isabel | last3 = Kwesiga | first3 = Joy | last4 = Mungwa | first4 = Alice | title = African women's movements: transforming political landscapes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780511479014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the identification of VAW as a critical issue in the Southern African Women's Charter.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}

==Access to justice for female victims of violence==

===International and regional instruments===
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.

The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women – also known as the Belém do Parà Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&amp;ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

===Examples of measures put in place===
As violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for "battered women". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

Innovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.

[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post" /&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"/&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.

*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape - its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

*'''Challenges in making a case in court:''' the burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence". This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.

*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.

*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers. Therefore, police attitudes are crucial in facilitating a sense of safety and comfort for women who have been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = T.

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW | title = General discussion on women and access to justice | url = http://wilpf.org/cedaw-general-discussion-on-women-and-access-to-justice/ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 18 February 2013 | accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem."

==Istanbul Convention==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC)''' was an international [[Advocacy group|advocacy]] organization, created in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424602884.html]&lt;/ref&gt; representing [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish refugees from Arab countries]]. The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries was created to make certain that any "just settlement of the refugee problem" recognizes those Jews who were forced to flee from lands where they had lived for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm THE OTHER REFUGEES: JEWS OF THE ARAB WORLD]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WOJAC functioned for approximately 25 years (from 1975 until 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav. ''Ethnicity and National Memory: The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) in the Context of the Palestinian National Struggle''. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2016}} WOJAC's aspiration was to operate in the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the Palestinian leadership on the right to the land and on the refugee question.

'''Zygmunt Bauman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|m|ən}}; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish [[sociology|sociologist]] and philosopher. He was driven out of [[Poland]] by a political purge in 1968 engineered by the Communist government of the [[Polish People's Republic]] and forced to give up his Polish citizenship to move to Israel. Three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971 and became Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Leeds]], later Emeritus. Bauman was one of the world's most eminent social theorists, writing on issues as diverse as [[modernity]] and the [[Holocaust]], [[postmodernity|postmodern]] [[consumerism]] and [[liquid modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt, B. (2000). Liquid modernity. Polity, Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780745624099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}
Bauman was born to non-observant [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] parents in [[Poznań]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], in 1925. When Poland was [[German invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|by the Soviet Union]], in 1939, his family escaped eastwards into the USSR. Bauman then enlisted in the Soviet-controlled [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|First Polish Army]], working as a political instructor. He took part in the battles of [[Battle of Kolberg (1945)|Kolberg]] (now Kołobrzeg) and of [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. In May 1945 he was awarded the Military [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Valour]]. After World War II he became one of the [[Polish Army]]'s youngest majors.

According to the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]], from 1945 to 1953 Bauman was a political officer in the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW), a military unit formed to combat [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukrainian nationalist insurgents]] and part of the remnants of the [[Polish Home Army]].&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl"&gt;Piotr Gontarczyk: [http://ipn.gov.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47281/1-7151.pdf ''Towarzysz "Semjon".

S. 74–83&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bauman worked for military intelligence from 1945 to 1948. However, the nature and extent of his collaboration remain unknown, as well as the exact circumstances under which it was terminated.&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl"/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bauman confirmed he had been a committed communist during and after World War II and had never made a secret of it. He admitted that joining the military intelligence service at age 19 was a mistake although he had a "dull" desk-job and did not remember informing on anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Aida Edemariam, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/28/academicexperts.highereducation "Professor with a past"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' piece erroneously claimed that the ''Brickhouse article'', to which it referred, was written by [[Bogdan Musiał]], a conservative Polish historian working in Germany. In fact, it was written by the Institute of National Remembrance employee, Piotr Gontarczyk; Musiał had simply repeated Gontarczyk's findings in the German ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving in the [[Internal Security Corps|KBW]], Bauman first studied sociology at the Warsaw Academy of Political and Social Science. In the KBW Bauman, already in the rank of major, was suddenly dishonourably discharged in 1953, after his father had approached the Israeli embassy in Warsaw with a view to emigrating to [[Israel]]. As Bauman did not share his father's [[Zionism|Zionist]] tendencies and was indeed strongly anti-Zionist, his dismissal caused a severe, though temporary estrangement from his father. During the period of unemployment that followed, he completed his M.A. and in 1954 became a lecturer at the [[University of Warsaw]], where he remained until 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During a spell at the [[London School of Economics]], where his supervisor was [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]], he prepared a comprehensive study on the British socialist movement, his first major book. Published originally in Polish in 1959, a revised edition appeared in English in 1972. Bauman went on to publish other books, including ''Socjologia na co dzień'' ("Everyday Sociology", 1964), which reached a large popular audience in Poland and later formed the foundation for the English-language text-book ''Thinking Sociologically'' (1990). Initially, Bauman remained close to orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, but influenced by [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Georg Simmel]], he became increasingly critical of Poland's Communist government. Owing to this he was never awarded a [[professorship]] even after he completed his [[habilitation]] but, after his former teacher, [[Julian Hochfeld]], was made vice-director of [[UNESCO]]'s Department for Social Sciences in Paris in 1962, Bauman did in fact inherit Hochfeld's chair.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Faced with increasing political pressure connected with a political purge led by [[Mieczysław Moczar]], the Chief of the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Polish Communist Security Police]], Bauman renounced his membership of the governing [[Polish United Workers' Party]] in January 1968. The [[March 1968 events]] culminated in a purge that drove many remaining Communist Poles of Jewish descent out of the country, including those intellectuals who had fallen from grace with the [[Polish communism|communist]] government.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Bauman, who had lost his chair at the [[University of Warsaw]], was among them. Having had to give up Polish citizenship to be allowed to leave the country, he first went to [[Israel]] to teach at [[Tel Aviv University]], before accepting the chair of sociology at the University of Leeds, where he intermittently also served as head of department. After his appointment, he published almost exclusively in English, his third language, and his reputation grew. Indeed, from the late 1990s, Bauman exerted a considerable influence on the [[Anti-globalization|anti-]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In a 2011 interview in the Polish weekly, "[[Polityka]]", Bauman criticised Zionism and Israel, saying Israel was not interested in peace and that it was "taking advantage of the Holocaust to legitimize unconscionable acts". He compared the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] to the walls of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] where hundreds of thousands of Jews had died in the Holocaust. The Israeli ambassador to Warsaw, Zvi Bar, called Bauman's comments "half truths" and "groundless generalizations."&lt;ref&gt;Roman Frister, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/polish-jewish-sociologist-compares-west-bank-separation-fence-to-warsaw-ghetto-walls-1.381828 Polish-Jewish sociologist compares West Bank separation fence to Warsaw Ghetto walls], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauman was a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Bauman was married to writer [[Janina Bauman]], née Lewinson; 18 August 1926 – 29 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75475,7405822,Janina_Bauman_nie_zyje.html Janina Bauman nie żyje], ''Gazeta Wyborcza''.

==Work==
Bauman's published work extends to 57 books and well over a hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/sociology/people/baumanbibliog.htm |title=Academic Staff " Sociology and Social Policy " University of Leeds |publisher=University of Leeds|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these address a number of common themes, among which are [[globalisation]], [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]], [[consumerism]], and [[morality]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Early work===
Bauman's earliest publication in English is a study of the British [[labour movement]] and its relationship to class and [[social stratification]], originally published in Poland in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Between Class and Élite. The Evolution of the British Labour Movement: A Sociological Study''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1972.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to publish on the subject of class and social conflict until the early 1980s. His last book was on the subject of ''Memories of Class''.&lt;ref&gt;''Memories of Class: The Pre-History and After-Life of Class''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst his later books do not address issues of class directly, he continued to describe himself as a socialist, and he never rejected [[Marxism]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Bunting, "Passion and pessimism".

===Modernity and rationality===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Bauman published a number of books that dealt with the relationship between modernity, bureaucracy, rationality and social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Cambridge: Polity, 1991, and ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Polity/Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman, following [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], came to view European modernity as a trade off: European society, he argued, had agreed to forego a level of freedom to receive the benefits of increased individual security. Bauman argued that modernity, in what he later came to term its 'solid' form, involved removing unknowns and uncertainties. It involved control over nature, hierarchical bureaucracy, rules and regulations, control and categorisation — all of which attempted to remove gradually personal insecurities, making the chaotic aspects of human life appear well-ordered and familiar. 
[[File:Zygmunt Bauman, fot. M. Oliva Soto (6144135392).jpg|thumb|Bauman in 2011]]
Later in a number of books Bauman began to develop the position that such order-making never manages to achieve the desired results. When life becomes organised into familiar and manageable categories, he argued, there are always social groups who cannot be administered, who cannot be separated out and controlled. In his book ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman began to theorise about such indeterminate persons in terms of an allegorical figure he called, 'the stranger.' Drawing upon Georg Simmel's sociology and the philosophy of [[Jacques Derrida]], Bauman came to write of the stranger as the person who is present yet unfamiliar, society's ''undecidable''. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'' Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled or ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is a constant threat.

Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of those kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman developed the argument that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he argued, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorisation of different species, and the tendency to view obedience to rules as morally good, all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. He argued that for this reason modern societies have not fully grasped the lessons of the Holocaust; it tends to be viewed—to use Bauman's metaphor—like a picture hanging on the wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempt made by society to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements that exist within it. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Postmodernity and consumerism===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Bauman began to explore ''postmodernity'' and ''consumerism''.&lt;ref&gt;''Work, Consumerism and the New Poor'', Open University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed Freud's "modern" tradeoff—i.e., security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase, consume, and enjoy life. In his books in the 1990s Bauman wrote of this as being a shift from "modernity" to "post-modernity". 

Since the turn of the millennium, his books have tried to avoid the confusion surrounding the term "postmodernity" by using the metaphors of "liquid" and "solid" modernity. In his books on modern consumerism, Bauman still writes of the same uncertainties that he portrayed in his writings on "solid" modernity; but in these books he writes of fears becoming more diffuse and harder to pin down. Indeed, they are, to use the title of one of his books, "liquid fears" – fears about [[paedophilia]], for instance, which are amorphous and have no easily identifiable reference.&lt;ref&gt;See ''In Search of Politics'', Polity, 1999.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauman is credited with coining the term [[allosemitism]] to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as the [[Other (philosophy)|other]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A.

Retrieved 9 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman reportedly predicted the negative political effect that social media have on voter's choice by denouncing them as 'trap' where people only 'see reflections of their own face'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/19/inenglish/1453208692_424660.html|title=Zygmunt Bauman: "Social media are a trap|last=De Querol|first=Ricardo|date=25 January 2016|publisher=El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Bauman was awarded the [[European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences]] in 1992 and the [[Theodor W. Adorno Award]] of the city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1998. He was awarded in 2010, jointly with [[Alain Touraine]], the ''[[Princess of Asturias Awards|Príncipe de Asturias Prize]]'' for Communication and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities/ Press release: ''Prince of Asturias Awards: Alain Touraine and Zygmunt Bauman, Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531174332/http://www.fpa.es/en/press/news/alain-touraine-and-zygmunt-bauman-prince-of-asturias-award-for-communication-and-humanities|date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Leeds established 'The Bauman Institute' within its School of Sociology and Social Policy in his honour in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociology.leeds.ac.uk/bauman |title=The Bauman Institute|publisher=University of Leeds|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Lower Silesia, a small private higher education institution in Lower Silesia, [[Poland]], planned to award Bauman an honorary doctorate in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/kultur/article119301822/Ehrendoktor-mit-Hindernissen.html|title=Ehrendoktor mit Hindernissen|first=Gerhard|last=Gnauck|work=Die Welt|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a reaction to a major anti-communist and what Bauman supporters allege "anti-semitic" uproar against him, he eventually rejected the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/110471/leeds-professor-rejects-polish-award-over-antisemitic-slurs "Leeds professor rejects Polish award over antisemitic slurs"], ''The Jewish Chronicle''.

In 2015 the [[University of Salento]] awarded Bauman an honorary degree in Modern Languages, Literature and Literary Translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisalento.it/web/guest/393/-/news/viewDettaglio/57840893/10122|title=Laurea honoris causa a Zygmunt Bauman: materiali (Honorary degree to Zygmunt Bauman: resources)|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=9 January 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In 2014, Peter Walsh, a PhD candidate at the [[University of Cambridge]], accused Bauman of plagiarism from several websites, including Wikipedia, in his book ''Does the Richness of the Few Benefit Us All?'' (2013). In this book Bauman is said to have copied verbatim paragraphs from Wikipedia articles on [[Slow Food]] and [[steady-state economy]], along with their bibliography, without attributing sources, authors or the fact that they were copied from Wikipedia. He did use a paragraph from the article on the [[golden handshake]], but this citation was properly attributed to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KOMPROMITACJE: Zygmunt Bauman przepisuje z Wikipedii albo wielka nauka i małe machlojki|url=http://kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/bauman-przepisuje-z-wikipedii.html|website=kompromitacje.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a response Bauman suggested that "obedience" to "technical" rules was unnecessary, and that he "never once failed to acknowledge the authorship of the ideas or concepts that I deployed, or that inspired the ones I coined".&lt;ref name="plagiarism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=Zygmunt Bauman rebuffs plagiarism accusation|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/zygmunt-bauman-rebuffs-plagiarism-accusation/2012405.article|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a detailed critique of Walsh and co-author David Lehmann, cultural critics Brad Evans and Henry A. Giroux concluded: "This charge against Bauman is truly despicable. It's a reactionary ideological critique dressed up as the celebration of method and a back-door defence of a sterile empiricism and culture of positivism. This is a discourse that enshrines data, correlations, and performance, while eschewing matters of substance, social problems, and power."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Evans and Henry A.
