The '''AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme''' is a five-year strategic research initiative funded by two UK research councils: the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. running 2007-2012. It has funded 75 projects across UK universities investigating various aspects of the complex relationships between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.

Research supported includes the website "British Religion in Numbers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brin.ac.uk/ British Religion in Numbers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029143012/http://www.brin.ac.uk/ |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a one-stop shop for statistics on religion in Britain led by Professor [[David Voas]] at [[Manchester University]], Professor Kim Knott at [[Leeds University]]'s restudy of British media coverage of religion and spirituality, and an investigation of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh shrine practices across the Punjab led by Dr Tej Purewal, also at Manchester. Phase 2 of the Programme has focused on Youth and Religion specifically, supporting projects like Dr Basia Spalek at [[Birmingham University]]'s research into police partnerships with young Muslims.

The Religion and Society Programme is hosted at [[Lancaster University]], and directed by Professor [[Linda Woodhead]] helped by Dr Rebecca Catto (Research Associate) and Peta Ainsworth (Administrator). The Programme also helps to organize various relevant and topical events such as a day at the British Library asking ‘where next for religion in the public sphere’ in July 2010 and a closed seminar asking ‘Child abuse in the Catholic Church – what can be learned?’ at [[Heythrop College]] London in November 2010.

== Sociology of Religion ==
Sociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's ''[[the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can’t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).

== Religion in America ==
Religion in America has had a relationship since the very beginning of the nation. This relationship has changed over time and has shaped the culture. It started with the Native Americans and their worship of the Great Spirits. They believed that their ancestors watched over them and that the spirits in nature blessed them. When colonist came to America, they brought Christianity along with them. They tried to integrate the religion into the lives of the Native people. Christianity branched out and separated into Protestant and Catholic (Trundle, 2012). There were many forms of Protestant like [[Methodist]], Lutheran, and Quakers. There are other forms of Catholic as well, including the [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern Orthodox. Later other religions were introduced to America through immigration. Religions like [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], and many others. These began to influence the culture. America was known as the melting pot of different cultures and religions. It was seen as a safe haven for those seeking religious freedom. Religion has effected America in many ways over the years. It was the reason the colonist came to America, and was used as an excuse for dominating over the Native Americans (Trundle, 2012). It was also used as a foundation for the civil rights movement as Martin Luther King Jr. presented his speech through his own personal belief system. More recent was September 11 when the twin towers were destroyed through religious beliefs. The bombers claimed that it was for religious purposes on why they did what they did. In effect, all religions joined together in America to rebuild and grow stronger. Religion has brought people together in times of need, throughout history. It has also caused negative effects in society as explained with 9/11.

== What happens after Religion ==
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It's possible that in a generation, there simply won’t be religion across [[Europe]] and large sections of [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[Asia]]. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, and tell them to be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.

We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings that make up these stories go on. We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose. We want to live for something more than just ourselves. Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas. These are romantic love, and professional success, and it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption. It's not enough, as we know. We need reminders to be good, places to reawaken awe, and something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses. Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers and rituals that bring us together. The choice isn’t between religion and a secular world as it is now. The challenge is to learn from religions, so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide (Giovanni, 2003).

'''''Almond Blossoms''''' is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Arles]] and [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], [[southern France]] of blossoming [[almond]] trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh.  They represented awakening and hope.  He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of [[Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]], and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut]]s. ''Almond Blossom'' was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]].

==Southern France==
In 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career.  In connection with their painting ''[[Farmhouse in Provence]]'' (1888), the [[National Gallery of Art]] notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,
reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was "the Japan of the South." Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.  Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |work=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830—1900) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Gallery of Art |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |page=12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 [[fruit tree]]s in the orchards were about to bloom.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=49| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[blossom]]s of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him,&lt;ref name=VGM671&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3128&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Almond Blossom, 1890  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees.&lt;ref name=VGM557&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0035V1962 |title=Almond Tree in Blossom, 1888   |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day.&lt;ref name=Fell&gt;{{cite book| author=Fell, D |year=2001 |title=Van Gogh's Gardens | location=United Kingdom |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=25 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 21 he wrote to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], that he "will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming."&lt;ref name=VGM557/&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Japonaiserie Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)''&lt;br&gt;by Vincent van Gogh, 1887 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], [[Amsterdam]] (F371)]]
Van Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese [[woodcut|wood block]] prints.  [[Hiroshige]]'s  ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow.  Van Gogh used the term ''[[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]]'' to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]].  Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called ''[[ukiyo-e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=54 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Wallace70"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853—1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, "Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop."&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=200 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer.

While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | pages=43–44| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book''==
Vincent wrote to Theo, "Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,"  and he has "two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it."  The two studies are ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass'' and ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/466.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh.

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''==
Although [[fruit tree]]s were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles,&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt; the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2515&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=Sprig of Flowering Almond Blossom in a Glass, 1888 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt;

In ''Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life'', [[Bruce Ross]] evaluates the [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] effect on van Gogh's work, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Van Gogh's bright ''Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass'' embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass.  The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space.  There is no formal decorative intent.  Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope.  Van Gogh has transformed the still  life with the help of these values.  He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility.  His use of bright color reflects this.  There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, [[ikebana]], in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life | author=Ross, B | editor=Trutty-Coohill, P  | publisher=Springer | location=Heidelberg, London, and New York | year=2010 | pages=215–216| chapter=Vincent van Gogh's Irises: Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights | isbn=978-90-481-9159-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmIacB5qVZ0C&amp;pg=PA215|quote=These streams include: 1) French impressionist's practice of using unadorned objects from life and 2) use of space between objects as objects themselves to the point of over-orchestration. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Almond Blossom''==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Almond blossom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Almond blossom'', 1890 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], (F671)]]  
In mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, "The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 14 March 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits   |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In ''Almond Tree in Blossom'', Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of [[divisionism]] for a sparkling surface effect.  The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rendering of ''Almond Blossom'' is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.

Theo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife.  He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;

Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo's]] baby,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/627.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to His Mother. Written c. 20 February 1890 in Saint-Rémy. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt; The close-up of the branches brings to mind [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s proposition that "even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;  The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights: Lectures and Essays on Philosophy, Literature and the Arts | author=Ross, B | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | location=New York | year=208 | page=52 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HvvB-xrxxUC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andretta''' is a village and an [[artists' colony]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The artists' colony was established in the 1920s, when Irish theatre artiste and environmentalist, [[Norah Richards]], shifted here from Lahore. Near [[Palampur]] in the [[Kangra District]], with [[Dhauladhar]] range of the Himalayas as a backdrop, Andretta over the years has attracted many noted artists, theatre practitioners, painters and more recently potters. Two of the people who became associated with it early on were painters [[Sobha Singh (painter)|Sobha Singh]] and [[B. C. Sanyal]].&lt;ref name=toi13/&gt;

==History==

Norah, an actress originally from Ireland, married Philip Richards, who was a professor at [[Government College, Lahore]]. She arrived in [[Lahore]], an important cultural centre, in 1908. She later became vice-principal at [[Dayal Singh College, Lahore]]. 

In the following years, she played a pivotal role in establishing modern [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] theatre, staging plays with Punjabi themes. After the death of her husband, she went back briefly, only to return in 1924, when she made Andretta, a village near Palampur, her home. She built a traditional Kangra-style mud house, known as ‘Chameli Niwas’, employing local style and material, using mud, slate and bamboo. She also built a makeshift proscenium and invited Punjabi theatre amateurs and professionals to perform plays.&lt;ref name=tri02&gt;{{cite web| title =Fragrant memories of Norah Richard’s Chameli Niwas|author=Charu Dogra |publisher=The Tribune| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020413/windows/main5.htm |date= 13 April 2002| accessdate = 2014-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=out/&gt;

In 1935, the District Commissioner of Kangra gave Richards 15 acres of land, and the Woodland Estate came into existence. She started a school of drama, and in time the village was known as "Mem-da-pind" (Village of [[Sahib#Colonial and modern use|Memsahib]]). 

In its early days, travel to the village was not easy. It took a 12-hour train journey, followed by a bus ride, and the last nine miles from [[Banuri (village)|Banuri]] (the nearest village) were covered on foot. Even so, it started attracting artists from all over, especially Lahore. 

This included painter [[B. C. Sanyal]] and professor Jai Dayal Singh, a pupil of Philip Richards from [[Lahore University]], through the 1940s. Sanyal started organizing painting exhibitions to fund the Norah Centre for Arts and a resort. Noted painter, [[Sobha Singh (painter)|Sobha Singh]], most known for making Sikh religious painting, moved in and stayed here till his death in 1986.&lt;ref name=tri02/&gt;&lt;ref name=out&gt;{{cite web|title=Andretta Artists' Village: The Irish Lahorian |author=Charu Soni |url=http://traveller.outlookindia.com/destination.aspx?id=569&amp;id1=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715024357/http://traveller.outlookindia.com/destination.aspx?id=569&amp;id1=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |publisher=Outlook Traveller }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards nurtured Punjabi theatre through the 1940s and 1960s, and came to be known as the "grandmother of Punjabi theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = PU writers’ home at Andretta |publisher=The Tribune, Chandigarh| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000711/himachal.htm#2|date= 11 July 2000|accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further on, Gurucharan Singh, a noted potter who started the Delhi Blue Pottery in the 1952, established base here. Active till the end, he died in 1995 at the age of 99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = This above all: Master potter|publisher=The Tribune| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98nov14/saturday/aboveall.htm|date= 14 November 1998| accessdate = 2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freda Bedi]], mother of actor [[Kabir Bedi]], who converted to Buddhism, lived at the village for a while.&lt;ref name=toi13/&gt;

[[File:Andretta pottery at Dastkar Bazaar, Delhi.jpg|thumb|Andretta pottery at [[Dastkar]] Bazaar, Delhi.]]
In 1983, Mansimran "Mini" Singh, son of noted potter Gurcharan Singh, and his wife Mary Singh moved here and started Andretta Pottery and Craft Society with a production studio which produces earthen slipware and a terracotta museum. They set up a Central Government Rural Marketing Centre with a grant of Rs 1,35,000 to provide assistance to potters. The society runs three-month-long residential courses for potters. Today, pottery from Andretta is sold at outlets across India.&lt;ref name=toi13&gt;{{cite web | title = Himachal's pot secret | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-04/travel/38528897_1_himachal-pradesh-malana-hptdc |date=4 July 2013| accessdate = 2014-02-16 |pages=1–2| publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  Andretta-A sanctuary of potters |publisher=The Hindu| url = http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/30/stories/2004073006550300.htm|date= 30 Jul 2004| accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Richards was made a fellow by the [[Punjabi University]] in [[Patiala]], while in turn she willed her house and land around it to the university. Today, the estate of [[Norah Richards]] has been renovated and maintained by the university. Each year on her birthday, 29 October, a Punjabi theatre festival is hosted by the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rs-jsaPenxYC&amp;pg=PA696|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0608-6|page=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clay13&gt;{{cite web| title = Clay and Sky |publisher= The Indian Express| url = http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/clay-and-sky/# |author=Aditi Banerjee |date=21 April 2013| accessdate = 2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhils''' or '''Bheels''' are primarily an ethnic group of people in [[West India]]. Bhils are also settled in the [[Tharparkar District]] of [[Sindh]], Pakistan. They speak the [[Bhil languages]], a subgroup of the [[Indo-Aryan languages#Western Zone|Western Zone]] of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. As of 2013, Bhils were the largest tribal group in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://tribal.nic.in/ST/StatisticalProfileofSTs2013.pdf|title=Statistical Profile of Scheduled Tribes in India|last=|first=|publisher=Ministry of Tribal Affairs|year=2013|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhils are listed as indigenous people of the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Rajasthan]] - all in the  western [[Deccan]] regions and central India - as well as in [[Tripura]] in far-eastern India, on the border with [[Bangladesh]]. Bhils are divided into a number of [[endogamy|endogamous]] territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. Most Bhils now speak the language of the region they reside in, such as [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] or a [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] dialect.

== Present circumstances ==

In Azamgarh and Jaunpur, the Bhil are now mainly a community of settled farmers, with a significant minority who are landless agricultural labourers. A significant subsidiary occupation remains hunting and gathering. The Bhil are now largely [[Hindu]], with [[Nirdhi Bhil|Nirdhi]] following [[Islam]], and few sub-groups in the [[Dang District, India|Dangs]] following [[Christianity]]. They continue to worship tribal deities such as Dev Mogra Mata and Sitla Mata.&lt;ref name="R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham page 214"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 214 to 221 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India Maharashtra Volume XXX  Part  One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 280–286&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhil are classified as a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribe]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], Rajasthan and [[Tripura]] under the [[Reservation in India|Indian government's reservation program]] of [[positive discrimination]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-divisions ==
The Bhil are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. The main divisions in [[Gujarat]] are the [[Barda (tribe)|Barda]], [[Dungri Garasia]], and [[Vasava]], while in [[Maharashtra]], the [[Bhil Mavchi]] and Kotwal are their main sub-groups.&lt;ref name="R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham page 214"/&gt;

In [[Rajasthan]], they exist as  [[Bhil Garasia]], [[Dholi Bhil]], [[Dungri Bhil]], [[Dungri Garasia]], [[Mewasi Bhil]], [[Rawal Bhil]], [[Tadvi Bhil]], [[Bhagalia]], [[Bhilala]], Pawra, [[Vasava]] and [[Vasave]].&lt;ref name="census2001"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Census of India: Government of India |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |date=7 March 2007 |title=List of Scheduled Tribes |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605042409/http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/scst_main.html |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The [[Vasava]] and [[Vasave]] in [[Rajasthan]] may be alternate transliterations of the name for a single community.

== Language ==
[[File:A partial specimen of the Bhili Language.png|thumb|Partial specimen of the Bhili language]]
The language commonly spoken by Bhils throughout their geographic distribution is [[Bhili language|Bhili]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoQqpkfrXfAC&amp;dq=bhil+language&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Ethnographic Atlas of Indian Tribes|last=Mehta|first=Sonu|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Mehta|editor-first=Prakash Chandra|location=New Delhi|pages=191|chapter=Bhils - I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhili has about up to 36 identified dialects and pronunciation differs by region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/14048|title=Dialect Continuum in the Bhil Tribal Belt: Grammatical Aspects|last=Phillips|first=Maxwell P.|publisher=University of London|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhili is based on Gujarati, but dialects of Bhili gradually merge into more widely-spoken languages such as Marathi in the southeast and Rajasthani in the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcTz54VVHF4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Being Tribal|last=Ratnagar|first=Shereen|publisher=Primus Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of individuals speaking the language are often inaccurate as speakers of minor languages like Bhili have sometimes been treated as having major languages (such as Marathi or Gujarati) as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.96184|title=Census of India 1951|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=61|chapter=Paper No. I - Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Bhils have rich and unique culture. The Bhilala sub-division is known for its [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pachauri|first1=Swasti|title=Pithora art depicts different hues of tribal life|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/pithora-art-depicts-different-hues-of-tribal-life/|accessdate=13 February 2015|work=Indian Express|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghoomar]] is a traditional [[folk dance]] of Bhil tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inquisitive Social Sciences|last=Kumar|first=Ashok Kiran|publisher=S.

=== Cuisine ===
Main foods of Bhils are [[maize]], [[onion]], [[garlic]] and [[Chilli]] which they cultivate in their small fields. The vegitables and fruits  collected by them from forests. [[Wheat]] and [[rice]] are used at time of festivals and other special occasions only. They keep self-made bows and arrow, sword, Knife, axe etc with them as weapon for self-protection and hunting the wild fauna which also form the major part of their diet. They profusely use alcohol distilled by them from the flower of Mahua([[Madhuca longifolia]]). On festive occasions various special preparation from the dish rich, i.e Makka, genhu, lapsi, kasar and chawal etc. Bhils are traditionally non-vegetarian. They eat the meat of Goat, Chicken, Fish, Bull, Deer etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith and worship===
Every village has its own local deity ([[Gramadevata|Gramdev]]) and families too have their Jatidev, [[Kuladevata|Kuldev]] and Kuldevi(house hold deity) which symbolised by stones. 'Bhati dev' and 'Bhilat dev' are their serpent-god. 'Baba dev' is their village god. Karkulia dev is their crop god, Gopal dev is their pastoral god, Bag dev is their Lion god, Bhairav dev is their dog god. Some of their other gods are Indel dev, Bada dev, Mahadevel, Tejaji, Lotha mai, Techma, Orka Chichma and Kajal dev. A number of Hindu deities have now also been worshipped by them, viz. [[Hanuman]], [[Shri Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Shiva]], [[Laxmi]], [[Ganesh]], [[Kuber]], [[Indra]] and  [[Durga]]. 

They have much faith in magico-religious beliefs and [[Bhopa]]s for their physical, mental and psycological treatements. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
There are a number of festivals, viz. [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]], [[Navratri]], [[Dashera]], [[Diwali]], [[Holi]] which celebrated by the Bhils. They also celebrate some traditional festivals viz. Akhatij, Navmi, Howan Mata ki Chalavani, Sawan Mata ki jatar, Diwasa, Nawai, Bhagoria, Gal, Gar, Dhobi, Sanja, Indel, Doha etc with ceremonious zeal and ethusiasm. 

During some festivals there are a number of tribal fairs held at different places of districts. Navratri mela, [[Bhagoria Festival|Bhagoria]] mela(during Holi festival) etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal dance and festivities===
The chief means of their recreation is folk songs and dances. Women dance at birth celebrations, marriage functions and on a few festivals in traditional Bhili style accompanied by a drum beat. Their dances include the Lathi dance, Dhol dance, marriage dance, Holi dance, Battle dance, Bhagoria dance, Deepawal dance and hunting dance. Musical instruments include the [[Harmonium]], [[Sarangi]], kundi, [[Bansuri]], apang, khajria, [[Tabla]], [[Cymbal|jhanjh]], [[Madal|Mandal]] and Thali. They are usually made from local products.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UjhLDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Bhil+people+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtaP_L1LtV&amp;sig=msu_cEDmYMf0dgeC7_pHzLNgxkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN6uvl94LeAhVWWX0KHWMgCRA4RhDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhil%20people%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The map can be outright falsified, or created using subjectivity with the goal of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that maps are subjective is not new; cartographers refer to maps as a human-subjective product and some view cartography as an "industry, which packages and markets spatial knowledge"&lt;ref name="Sorrell 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=P.E.|title=Cartography: A manufacturing industry concerned with the Processing, Transformation, Packaging and Transportation of Spatial Data|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=December 1981|volume=18|issue=2|pages=84–90|doi=10.1179/caj.1981.18.2.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or as a communicative device distorted by human subjectivity.&lt;ref name="Wood 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=Human Factors in Cartographic Communication|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=December 1972|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–132|doi=10.1179/caj.1972.9.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cartographic [[propaganda]] is widely successful because maps are often presented as a miniature model of reality, and it is a rare occurrence that a map is referred to as a distorted model, which sometimes can "lie" and contain items that are completely different from reality.&lt;ref name="Boardman 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boardman|first=David|title=Graphicacy and Geography Teaching|year=1983|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word propaganda has become a pejorative, it has been suggested that mapmaking of this kind should be described as “persuasive cartography,” defined as maps intended primarily to influence opinions or beliefs – to send a message – rather than to communicate geographic information.&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, Judith A.

== History ==

[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|Earliest printed example of a classical T and O map (by [[Günther Zainer]], Augsburg, 1472), illustrating the first page of chapter XIV of the ''Etymologiae'' of Isidore of Seville.  It shows the continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]]: Sem ([[Shem]]), Iafeth ([[Japheth]]) and Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]]).]]

The [[T-O map]] is a historical example of cartographic propaganda during the Middle Ages.  During the Renaissance maps became more widely used in general and their use began to take on a more cultural and political character, more similar to the cartographic propaganda that is seen today.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  This use was especially practiced in Italy, where the competition for resources between city states in the central and northern Italian heartlands led to a precocious awareness of the practical utility of maps for military and strategic purposes, as well as civilian uses such as the planning of forts, canals, and aqueducts.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16"/&gt;  In sequence, the usage of cartographic propaganda has increased remarkably alongside the rise of the [[Modern history|modern]] [[State (polity)|state]] (Black 1997; 2008).

The interwar period in Germany fostered the development of cartographic propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;(Boria 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nazi propaganda|German propagandists]] discovered the advantages of cartography in the re-representation of reality.&lt;ref name="Speier 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speier|first=Hans|title=Magic Geography|journal=Social Research: an International Quarterly|date=Fall 1941|volume=8|issue=3|pages=310–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For the Nazi regime, the most important goal in producing maps was their efficiency in providing communication between the ruler and the masses.&lt;ref name="Speier 1941" /&gt;  The use of maps in this manner can be referred to as "suggestive cartography," as being capable of dynamic representations of power.

This period of geopolitical cartographic development was a continuous process associated with [[Nazis]] and [[World War II]]; the development of cartographic propaganda is closely related to the wider Nazi propaganda machine (Tyner 1974). There were three different categories of propaganda maps that were used by the Nazi propaganda machine; (1) maps used to illustrate the condition of Germany as a people and nation are identified; (2) maps taking an aim at the morale of the Allies via a mental offensive through maps specifically designed to keep the U.S. neutral in the war by changing the perception of threats; and (3) maps as blue-prints of the post-war world.  During this period, this approach to cartography expanded to [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]] as cartographers and propagandists found inspiration in the "positivistic trends of the German world."&lt;ref&gt;(Boria 2007, Cairo 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This more overt use of maps as propaganda continued into the Cold War period.  Post-[[World War II]] U.S. cartographers modified projections to create a menacing image of the [[Soviet Union]] by making the Soviet Union appear larger and thus more threatening.  This approach was also applied to other nearby communist countries, thereby accentuating the rise of [[communism]] as a whole.  The April 1, 1946, issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published a map entitled 'Communist Contagion,' which focused on the communist threat of the Soviet Union.  In this map the strength of the Soviet Union was enhanced by a split-spherical presentation of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] which made the [[Soviet Union]] seem larger as a result of the break in the center of the map.  Communist expansion was also emphasized in this map as it presented the Soviet Union in a vivid red color, a color commonly associated with danger (and communism as a whole), and categorized neighboring states in terms of the danger of contagion, using the language of disease (states were referred to as quarantined, infected or exposed, adding to the presentation of these countries as dangerous or threatening).  More generally, during the Cold War period, small-scale maps served to make dangers appear menacing; some maps were made to make Vietnam appear close to [[Singapore]] and [[Australia]]; or [[Afghanistan]] to the Indian Ocean (Black 1997; 2008). Similarly, maps illustrating rocket positions used a polar azimuth projection with the North Pole at its center, which gave the map reader the perception that there existed a relatively small distance between the countries on opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;(Black 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Scale, map projection, and symbolization are characteristics of cartography that can be selectively applied that will therefore transform a map into cartographic propaganda.

=== Scale and generalization ===
[[Scale (map)|Scales]] are used to relate distance because maps are usually smaller than the area they represent.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the need for a scale, the cartographer often makes use of map generalization as a way to ensure clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of the scale affects the use of generalization; a smaller scale forces a higher level of generalization.

There are two types of [[Cartographic generalization|map generalization]]; geometric and content.  The methods of geometric generalization are selection, simplification, displacement, smoothing, and enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Content generalization promotes clarity of the purpose or meaning of a map by filtering out details irrelevant to the map's function or theme.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 35"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Content generalization has two essential elements; selection and classification.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 35"/&gt;  Selection serves to suppress information and classification is the choice of relevant features.
[[File:Lemierre The Voyage of Youth to the Land of Happiness 1802 Cornell CUL PJM 1030 01.jpg|thumbnail|Allegorical Map with navigation symbols of the Voyage of Youth to the Land of Happiness, 1802]]
=== Map projection ===
[[Map projection]] is the method of presenting the curved, three-dimensional surface of the planet into a flat, two-dimensional plane.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 8"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   The flat map, even with a constant scale, stretches some distances and shortens others, and varies the scale from point to point.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 8"/&gt;   Choice of map projection affects the map's size, shape, distance and/or direction.  Map projection has been used to create cartographic propaganda by making small areas bigger and large areas bigger still.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arno Peters]]' attack on the [[Mercator Projection]] in 1972 is an example of the subjectivity of map projection; Peters argued that it is an ethnocentric projection.&lt;ref name="Crampton 2010"&gt;(Crampton 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolization ===
[[Map symbolization|Symbols]] are used in maps to complement map scale and projection by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on a map.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 18"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because map symbolization describes and differentiates features and places, "map symbols serve as a geographic code for storing and retrieving data in a two-dimensional geographic framework."&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 18"/&gt;  Map symbolization tells the map reader what is relevant and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the selection of symbols can be done subjectively and with a propagandistic intent.

== Historical themes ==
The map is the perfect symbol of the state and has thus been used throughout history as a symbol of power and nationhood.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996"&gt;Monmonier 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  As a symbol the map has served many purposes of the state including the exertion of rule, legitimation of rule, assertion of national unity, and was even used for the mobilization of war.

=== Exerting imperial rule in medieval and renaissance Europe ===

Cartographic propaganda in Medieval Europe spoke to the emotions rather than to reason and often reflected the prestige of empires.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fra Mauro map|The Fra Mauro World Map]] (1450) was intended for display in Venice and shows the Portuguese discoveries in Africa and emphasizes the feats of Marco Polo.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52"/&gt;  The British East India Company commissioned a copy in 1804, implying that Britain was heir to the Portuguese empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fra Mauro World Map|url=http://www.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/map2.html|work=Magnificant Maps: Power, Propaganda, and Art|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Americas" (1562) was created by [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutiérrez]] and serves as a powerful celebration of Spain's New World Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The americas|url=http://www.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/map3.html|work=Magnificant Maps: Power, Propaganda, and Art|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this map, King Philip II is shown riding the turbulent Atlantic Ocean on a chariot; this illustration is reminiscent of the Roman God Neptune.  References like this were intended to strengthen Spain's image in Europe and its claim to the Americas.

European rulers often tried to intimidate visiting envoys by displaying maps of their masters' lands and forts, with the implication that the maps were a first step towards conquest.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 1527, during festivities for the French ambassador in England, maps depicting aerial views of French towns being successfully besieged by the English decorated the walls of a Greenwich pavilion specially built for the ambassador's visit.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35"/&gt;
[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumbnail|By displaying oversized flags of British possessions, this map artificially increases the apparent scope and power of the Empire]]
=== Legitimizing colonial rule ===
Colonial powers used the map as an intellectual tool to legitimize territorial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramsay Muir's "Cambridge Modern Historical Atlas" (Cambridge, 1912) compiled a selection of British triumphs.  Less glorious and unsuccessful earlier struggles with the Mysore and the Marathas were ignored.&lt;ref name="Black 2003" /&gt;

Maps during the colonial period were also used to organize and rank the rest of the world according to the European powers.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Jeremy|title=Mapping the Past: Historical Atlases|journal=Orbis|date=Spring 2003|pages=277–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Edward Quin]] used color to depict civilization in "Historical Atlas in a Series of Maps of the World" (London, 1830).  In the introduction of the atlas Quin wrote, "we have covered alike in all the periods with a flat olive shading...barbarous and uncivilized countries such as the interior of Africa at the present moment."&lt;ref name="Black 2003" /&gt;

[[File:Henry Mayer, The Awakening, 1915 Cornell CUL PJM 1176 01 - Restoration.jpg|thumbnail|The Puck Magazine illustration of The Awakening illustrated the spreading reach and "enlightened" goals of the suffrage movement five years before ratification of the 19th Amendment]]

=== Asserting national unity ===
A single overview map of an entire country serves as an assertion of national unity.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 88"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  The national atlas commissioned during the rule of Elizabeth I bound together maps of the various English counties and asserted their unity under Elizabeth's rule.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 88"/&gt;  A few decades later, Henry VI of France celebrated the reunification of his kingdom {{dubious|date=June 2017}} through the creation of the atlas, "Le theatre francoys."&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 89"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The atlas includes an impressive engraving proclaiming the glory of king and kingdom.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 89"/&gt;

=== Political use in the 19th and 20th centuries ===
[[File:Angling in troubled waters – a serio-comic map of Europe - Kungliga Biblioteket - 2818247-thumb.png|thumb|Angling in troubled waters – a serio-comic map of Europe - National Library of Sweden]]
In the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries the political potential of cartographic shapes became used more widely and began to be used for more blatantly propagandistic purposes.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;  Map and globe can be used as symbols for abstract ideas because they are familiar to the masses and they harbor emotive connotations.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"/&gt;  Maps are often incorporated as an emblematic element in a larger design or are used to provide the visual framework on which a scenario is played out.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"/&gt;

Fred W. Rose created two propaganda posters depicting the British general election in 1880 in which he used the map of England, "Comic Map of the British Isles indicating the Political Situation in 1880" and "The overthrow of His Imperial Majesty King Jingo I: A Map of the Political Situation in 1880 by Nemesis.".&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the creator of the 1899  "Angling in troubled waters".

Henri Dron used the figure of the world map in the 1869 propaganda poster, "L'Europe des Points Noirs."&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coaxing during World War I and II ===

[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|This French propaganda poster from 1917 portrayed Prussia as the octopus]]

Cartographic propaganda during WWI and WWII was used to polarize states along the lines of war and did so by appealing to the masses.  Fred Rose's "Serio-comic war map for the year 1877" portrayed the [[Russian Empire]] as an octopus stretching out its tentacles vying for control in Europe and was intended to solicit distrust of the Russian Empire within Europe.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;   This concept was used again in 1917 during WWI, when France commissioned a map which portrayed Prussia as the octopus.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164"/&gt; The octopus appeared again in 1942 as [[Vichy France|(Vichy) France]] intended to sustain its citizens' morale and cast [[Winston Churchill]] as the octopus, a demonic green-faced, red-lipped, cigar-smoking creature attempting to seize Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Targets ==
Political persuasion often concerns [[Territorial dispute|territorial claims]], [[Nationality|nationalities]], [[Nationalism|national pride]], [[border]]s, strategic positions, [[Conquest (military)|conquests]], attacks, troop movements, defenses, [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]], regional inequality, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of cartographic propaganda is to mold the map’s message by emphasizing supporting features while suppressing contradictory information.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996"/&gt;   Successful cartographic propaganda is geared toward an audience.

=== Political leadership ===

Before the U.S. had entered into WWII, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] came to possess a German map of Central and South America that depicted all Latin American republics reduced to “five vassal states...bringing the whole continent under their (Nazi) domination.”&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratzel|first=John, F. |author2=Leslie B. Rout, Jr. |title=FDR and the 'Secret Map'|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1976|volume=9|issue=1|pages=167–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   FDR viewed this as an open threat to “our great life line, the [[Panama Canal]]" and therefore mean that “the Nazi design is not only against South America, but against the U.S. as well.”&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"/&gt;  This map was undoubtedly propaganda, yet its target audience could have either been the German or American public.  The map was first discovered by the British and then brought to the attention of FDR.  Although Berlin claimed that it was a [[forgery]], the origin of the map is still unknown.&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"/&gt;

Some Nazi maps were commissioned as an attempt to divert sympathy from Britain and deter Allied aggression.  The Nazi map, "A Study in Empires" compares the size of Germany (264,300 sq. mi) to that of the British Empire (13,320,854 sq.  mi), arguing that Britain, not Germany, is the aggressor nation.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime also used maps to persuade the United States to remain neutral during WWII by flattering both isolationism and [[Monroe Doctrine]] militarism.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 107"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Spheres of Influence," created and published in 1941, uses bold lines traced around sections of the globe to send a clear message to Americans: stay in your own hemisphere and out of Europe.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 107"/&gt;

=== Military leadership ===
Cartographic propaganda can be used to mislead the enemy and its military by [[Disinformation|distorting]] maps and the information they contain which is used in military strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the Soviet Union launched the Soviet Map Distortion Policy which resulted in the thinning and distortion of detail in all unclassified maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000498616.pdf|title=Soviet Map Distortion Policy|publisher=CIA.gov|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Then in 1988 the Soviet Union’s chief cartographer, Viktor R. Yashchenko, admitted that Soviet maps had been faked for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Bill|title=Soviet Aide Admits Maps Were Faked for 50 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/03/world/soviet-aide-admits-maps-were-faked-for-50-years.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Soviet Union had deliberately falsified virtually all public maps of the country, misplacing streets, distorting boundaries, and omitting geographical features.&lt;ref name=Keller /&gt;   These were orders administered by the Soviet secret police.  Western experts said the maps were distorted out of fear of aerial bombing or foreign intelligence operations.&lt;ref name=Keller /&gt;

=== The masses ===

Cartographic propaganda during the Cold War often appealed to the fear of the masses.  During the Cold War period, maps of “us” versus “them” were drawn to emphasize the threat represented by the USSR and its allies.&lt;ref name=Walbert&gt;{{cite web|last=Walbert|first=David|title=Map skills and higher-order thinking|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mapping/6434|publisher=Learn NC|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R.M. Chapin, Jr. created the map, “Europe From Moscow,” in 1952.  The map was drawn from a different perspective, from Moscow looking onward toward Europe which made it easy for the map reader to imagine (red) armies sweeping across Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Walbert /&gt;

=== The classroom ===
[[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]]  schoolroom map of "Deutschland" in 1935 presented all the German-speaking areas surrounding Germany without borders, claiming them as part of the [[Reich]] .&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;   This gave the impression that the Reich extended over Austria and the German-speaking areas in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and even France.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159"/&gt;

M. Tomasik created the "Pictorial Map of European Russia," which was published in Warsaw in 1896 and 1903, provoked an image of Utopia in Russia.  The map was intended for display in Polish schools and was meant to appeal directly to the emotions of teachers and through them to those they taught.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  The map illustrated Russia as a nation rich in natural resources and failed to mention the [[Russian famine of 1891-1892|famine]] that occurred only five years earlier (1891-5) during which half a million people had died.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"/&gt;   The map also communicated the message of Russian unity; the nation's provinces were shown linked together by a new rail network and contributing to the nation's well-being.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"/&gt;

The term was coined in a 2006 study&lt;ref name="Eliminating"&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.120.5440|title=Eliminating the successor to plagiarism? Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=&lt;!-- 2007-05-23 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Thomas Lancaster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html Thomas Lancaster bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206154603/http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html |date=2009-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Clarke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-clarke/16/12a/967 |title=Robert Clarke bio |publisher=Linkedin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Birmingham City University|the University of Central England in Birmingham]] (now known as ''Birmingham City University'').

==Extent==

The first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating is a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster.&lt;ref name="Eliminating" /&gt; The study presented three main findings:

#Over 12 percent of postings on a popular website for outsourcing computer contract work are actually bid requests from students looking to attempt contract cheating.
#Contract cheaters posted an average of 4–7 requests, suggesting that habitual use is made of such services by these students.
#A smaller number of users have posted over 50 bid requests, including examples from multiple institutions. This suggests that these are agencies subcontracting work, not students who are directly making use of the services.

Whereas the quality of solutions to assignments sold by [[essay mill]] has been questioned, a study by Jenkins and Helmore showed that work obtained through the use of an [[Online auction|auction site]] was of sufficient quality to gain good marks and remain undetected by the module [[tutor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/Events/HEADublin2006_V2/papers/Tony%20Jenkins%2023.pdf |format=PDF|title=T. Jenkins and S. Helmore "Coursework for cash: the threat from on-line plagiarism", in Proceedings of 7th Annual Conference for Information and Computer Science, Dublin. Higher Education Academy pp121-126 (August 2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study examined over 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorise the assignment types (e.g. Programming, Database, Web Design) and are analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final year undergraduate and postgraduate) being posted onto auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/8th-annual-conf/Papers/Thomas%20Lancaster%20final.pdf|title=Assessing Contract Cheating Through Auction Sites – A Computing Perspective|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-09-13 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a study of 4,000 suspected cases of "contract cheating" some interesting patterns of behaviour have been observed. A summary was presented at the HEA Workshop on Contract Cheating (March 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/presentations/682_Private%20Life%20Annotated.pdf|title=The Private Life of an Assignment|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2011-01-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Aske conference held in June 2009 a paper detailing a "multi-faceted" approach to dealing with the problem of "contract cheating" was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/documents/Plagiarism09_LancasterClarke.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contract Cheating in UK Higher Education: promoting a proactive approach|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper presented at the STEM conference (April 2012) was a study of over 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from "Anthropology to Theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/stem-conference/Computing%201/Thomas_Lancaster_Robert_Clarke.pdf|title=Dealing with contract cheating: a question of attribution|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2012-04-18|accessdate=2012-05-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commercial Aspects of Contract Cheating are examined in a paper given at ITiCSE '13. This paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462497|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasLancaster/commercial-aspects-of-contract-cheating-iticse-2013|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating (Slides)|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 meta-analysis of 5 studies, 3.5% of a total of 1378 students reported buying assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted doing so more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Guy J.|last2=Clare|first2=Joseph|date=2017-04-20|title=How Prevalent is Contract Cheating and to What Extent are Students Repeat Offenders?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|journal=Journal of Academic Ethics|language=en|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|issn=1570-1727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The assignments prepared by essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', meaning that they are likely to evade detection by software packages such as Turnitin. Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M.J. and Newton P.M. 2014. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2014.889597#.VDj7k1fbGw0 Turnaround time and market capacity in contract cheating]. Educational Studies. 40(2) 233-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection ==
In July 2007 a paper proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4365466|title=Establishing a Systematic Six-Stage Process for Detecting Contract Cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2007-07-26|website=|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract cheating sites often claim this form of cheating is undetectable,&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lines|first=Lisa|date=2016-11-16|title=Ghostwriters guaranteeing grades? The quality of online ghostwriting services available to tertiary students in Australia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|journal=Teaching in Higher Education|volume=21|issue=8|pages=889–914|doi=10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|issn=1356-2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that has been tested in two studies. In a 2016 Australian study, when markers were asked to mark a set of contract cheating assignments and contract cheating was not mentioned to them, no marker raised any concerns of contract cheating.&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"/&gt; However, in a later study when markers were specifically asked to detect it, they correctly identified contract cheating 62% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Phillip|last2=Sutherland-Smith|first2=Wendy|date=2017-06-05|title=Can markers detect contract cheating? Results from a pilot study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|issn=0260-2938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clare|first=Joseph|last2=Walker|first2=Sonia|last3=Hobson|first3=Julia|date=2017-08-08|title=Can we detect contract cheating using existing assessment data? Applying crime prevention theory to an academic integrity issue|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|issn=1833-2595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the Plagiarism across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases where a student committed contract cheating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://plagiarism.pefka.mendelu.cz/files/proceedings_15.pdf |title=Plagiarism detection 2.0: Detection of Contract Cheating |last1=Khan |first1=Wasi |year=2015|publisher= Mendel University|book-title= |pages=215|location=Brno |conference= Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Khan, Wasi (Presenter)| date = Aug 3, 2015| title = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond| medium = Motion picture| language = English | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14f5AnfTy0A | access-date = November 12, 2017| location = Brno, Czech Republic | publisher = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-originality engines (like [[Turnitin]]) are unlikely to detect contract cheating, there has been some success in using them to identify the source of assignments detected on auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/stem-conference-2014/Post_event_resources/Computing/Using_Turnitin|title=Using Turnitin as a tool for attribution in cases of contract cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2014-04-13|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
In general, academic institutions consider contract cheating to be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct and it is penalised accordingly. In 2010 the 'AMBeR Project' developed a UK 'Plagiarism Tariff' in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious penalties available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions considered it to be a separate form of misconduct altogether due to the seemingly obvious intent associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/plagiarism-tariff-let-the-punishment-fit-the-demerit-points/412088.article|title=Plagiarism tariff: let the punishment fit the demerit points|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 research study, also in the UK, asked university students what they thought penalties for academic misconduct should be. The responses demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20205|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/hundreds-fail-to-spot-plagiarism/2019818.article|title=Hundreds fail to spot plagiarism|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199#.VccNJvma5kU|title= Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|accessdate=22 May 2016 | doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199|volume=41|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The legality of contract cheating services was reviewed by Newton and Lang in a 2016 book chapter of the Springer Handbook for Academic Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of these services varies internationally. In [[New Zealand]] it is illegal to "advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat", with similar, older laws on the statutes of 17 states in the US. 

In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|title=Education, deterrence, detection: how to tackle the problem of essay mills|date=2016-08-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919071215/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|archivedate=19 September 2016|work=QAA news}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggesting that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud as they involve 'false representation' and 'failure to disclose information'. A subsequent research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5|title=Are Essay Mills committing fraud? An analysis of their behaviours vs the 2006 Fraud Act (UK)|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the UK Fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that they would be unlikely to fall foul of [[Fraud]] law due to the disclaimers, terms and conditions they use which generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as 'study guides' or 'revision aids', thereby placing responsibility, and 'intent', onto the student client. Despite this,  media 'stings' have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1422913.ece|title=‘£630 and I’ll put you on the way to a first’|date=15 June 2014|author1=Robin Henry|author2=Cal Flyn|author3=Katie Glass|publisher=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7|title=Ethical and legal observations on contract cheating services as an agreement|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of [[Australian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1037969X17710627|title=Contract cheating: Will students pay for serious criminal consequences?|date=18 September 2017|publisher=|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=42|issue=2|pages=123–129|doi=10.1177/1037969x17710627}}&lt;/ref&gt; law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating.

A follow-up research study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5|title=A legal approach to tackling contract cheating?|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed such a new law, based on the principle of [[strict liability]], which lessens the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that they 'intended to help student cheat', but instead would make them liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating.  

More broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely due to the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.

Cărturești Carusel is a bookstore on [[Lipscani]] 55 Street in the old town of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

The building that currently houses the bookstore was built at the beginning of the 20th century by the Chrissoveloni bankers family. During the first few decades of its existence the building housed the Chrissoveloni Bank headquarters, and afterwards it became a general store. At the end of the 1990s and early 2000s the building fell into decay, up until 2015 when a 5 year long rehabilitation, strengthening and conversion project was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wall-street.ro/special/cladiri-emblema-ale-romaniei/179664/povestea-carturesti-carusel-mega-libraria-de-800-000-euro-din-lipscani-fotografii-din-seara-dinaintea-deschiderii.html|title=Cărturești Carusel în avanpremieră: o librărie spectacol, amenajată cu 400.000 euro (FOTO)|date=11 February 2015|website=Wall-Street.ro|publisher=|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], the setting of the work]]
'''''Dead Man Walking''''' (1993) is a work of non-fiction by Sister [[Helen Prejean]], a [[Roman Catholic nun]] and one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] based in New Orleans. Arising from her work as a spiritual adviser to two convicted murderers on [[Death Row]], the book is set largely at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (Angola) in [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]]. It examines moral issues related to the men's acknowledgement of their crimes and to the state's use of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, Linda. "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/onenight/about/producer.html The Producer's Journey]." [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved on September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prejean has become a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Her campaign was initiated following her correspondence and visits that she maintained with two convicted murderers. She started this ministry in 1982. The first man was [[Elmo Patrick Sonnier]], who was sentenced to death by electric chair. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his death. The second was [[Robert Lee Willie]], for whom she also served as spiritual adviser.

Prejean gained insight into the minds of these convicted murderers and the process involved in executions, including its effects on the prison guards and other personnel. She became convinced that the state's use of the death penalty was morally wrong and began speaking out against [[capital punishment]]. At the same time, she founded ''Survive'', an organization devoted to providing counseling to the families of victims of violence.

==Name==
The title of the book comes from a phrase once traditional in American prisons, to designate a man condemned to death. They were held on what was known as Death Row, deprived of most social contact and unable to work or participate in prison programs. Prior to the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, "Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!" The origin of the phrase is debated. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners, to let them know they should be on their guard since a [[death row]] prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of [[honorific]] declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way - death row prisoners being seen as an [[elite]] within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a [[Social stigma|stigma]] attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him in order not to catch his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (film)}}
In 1995, a film based on the book was made, starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Sean Penn]].

===Opera===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (opera)}}
The book was adapted as an [[Dead Man Walking (opera)|opera]] of the same name, composed by [[Jake Heggie]] with a libretto by playwright [[Terrence McNally]]. It premiered at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in October 2000. The international premiere of the opera was in August 2003, in Adelaide. It has been produced in several other cities, including by the [[Union Avenue Opera]] in St. Louis, Missouri.

[[File:Ponte_del_Diavolo,_Valli_di_Lanzo,_Lanzo_Torinese1.jpg|275px|thumb|Devil's Bridge (Italian: ''Ponte del Diavolo'') in [[Lanzo Torinese]], northern Italy.]]
[[File:Teufelsbrücke01.jpg|thumb|275px|''[[Teufelsbrücke]]'' of [[St Gotthard Pass]], Switzerland.]]
'''Devil's Bridge''' is a term applied to dozens of ancient [[bridge]]s, found primarily in [[Europe]]. Most of these bridges are stone or [[masonry]] [[arch bridge]]s and represent a significant technological achievement. Each of the Devil's Bridges has a corresponding [[Devil]]-related myth or folktale.

Local lore often wrongly attributes these bridges to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, but in fact many of them are [[Middle Ages|medieval]], having been built between 1000 and 1600 AD.{{cn|date=May 2016}} In medieval times [[Devil's Causeway|some Roman roads]] were themselves considered beyond human capabilities and needs, and therefore had to have been built by the devil.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Associated legends==

[[File:Pont du Diable - Céret.JPG|275px|thumb|[[Pont du Diable (Céret)|Pont du Diable]] in [[Céret]], southern France]]
The bridges that fall into the Devil's Bridge category are so numerous that the legends about them form a special category in the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] for [[folklore|folktales]] (Number 1191).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=D. L. Ashliman |authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1191.html |title=The Devil's Bridge: folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 1191 |type=private website |publisher=D. L. Ashliman |date= |location=Pittsburgh, USA |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs?|reson=personal website, lacking of public recognition?|date=October 2016}} Some legends have elements of related folktale categories, for example Deceiving the [[Devil]] (AT #1196), The Devil's Contract (AT #756B), and The Master Builder legends.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

One version of the tale presents the bridge builder and the Devil as adversaries. This reflects the fact that frequently, such as in the case of the ''[[Teufelsbrücke]]'' at the [[St Gotthard Pass]], these bridges were built under such challenging conditions that successful completion of the bridge required a [[hero]]ic effort on the part of the builders and the community, ensuring its legendary status.

Other versions of the legend feature an old lady or a simple [[herder]] who makes a [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]]. In this version the devil agrees to build the bridge, and in return he will receive the first [[soul]] to cross it.

After building the bridge (often overnight) the devil is outwitted by his adversary, for example by throwing bread to lure a dog over the bridge first, and is last seen descending into the water, bringing peace to the community.

In the case of the ''[[Stone Bridge (Regensburg)#Legend|Steinerne Brücke]]'' in [[Regensburg]], the legend speaks of the devil helping in a race between the builders of the bridge and of the cathedral (in fact a significantly later construction), and a slight bump in the middle of the bridge is said to result from the devil's leaping with rage upon being tricked out of his prize.

In the legend of ''[[Teufelsbrück]]'' in [[Hamburg]], which only leads over a small stream, the carpenter had a pact with the devil, and he promised him the first soul crossing the bridge. On the day of inauguration, while the priest and county councillor debated who should step on the bridge first, a rabbit crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared. A statue refers to the legend there.

The legend of [[Ponte della Maddalena]] in [[Borgo a Mozzano]], Province of [[Lucca]], tells of a local saint, often [[Julian the Hospitaller|Saint Julian, the Hospitaller]], who made the pact with the devil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chronicles of Julian, the Hospitaller|last=Bernardi|first=Eduardo|publisher=Higuma Limited|year=2018|isbn=978-0-473-43697-1|location=New Zealand|pages=Books 1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On the day of delivery, the saint sets fire to a dog or a pig that crosses the bridge and deceives the devil.

Most of the bridges that have received the Devil's Bridge appellation are remarkable in some regard, most often for the technological hurdles surpassed in building the bridge, but on occasion for its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] grace as well, or for its [[economics|economic]] or strategic importance to the community it serves.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

[[File:IngresPedroKissSwordOfHenri4.jpg|thumb|240px|''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword'', 1819 version, [[château de Pau]]]]
[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - The Sword of Henry IV - WGA11851.jpg|thumb|240px|''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword'', 1832, the [[Louvre]]]]
'''''Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword''''' is an 1814 painting in the [[Troubador style]] by the French artist [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], showing the Spanish ambassador [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, 5th Marquis of Villafranca]] kissing the sword of [[Henry IV of France]] (held by a young page) in the salle des Caryatides of the Louvre palace. The painting is now lost. Between 1819 and 1832, Ingres painted three additional paintings of the subject.

==History==
Episodes from the life of Henri IV were a frequent subject for French painters in Ingres' time.&lt;ref name="Condon_238"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 238. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident depicted in this painting was described by Ingres in one of his notebooks:&lt;blockquote&gt;One day Don Pedro of Toledo, the Ambassador of Spain to the court of Henri IV, saw in the Louvre the sword of the King in the hands of a young page. Advancing, he knelt on the ground and kissed it, rendering honor, he said, to the most glorious sword in Christendom.&lt;ref name="Condon_238"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The artist painted four versions of the subject between 1814 and 1832.

The original version was painted in 1814 and exhibited at the Paris Salon that year, where it was disparaged by critics.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"&gt;Radius, Emilio (1968). ''L'opera completa di Ingres''. Milan: Rizzoli. p. 96. {{OCLC|58818848}}&lt;/ref&gt; After even Ingres' friends found fault with it, Ingres reworked in 1820. The revised composition included the figures of the [[Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette|Duc d'Epernon]] and [[Gabrielle d'Estrées]] behind the ambassador and the page.&lt;ref name="Condon_78"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 78. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the painting since the mid-19th century is unknown.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; The composition of the painting before its revision is recorded in an engraving by Achille Réveil published in 1851.&lt;ref name="Condon_78"/&gt;

A second version (1819; now at the [[château de Pau]])&lt;ref name="chateau-pau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chateau-pau.fr/objet/don-pedro-de-tolede-baisant-lepee-dhenri-iv|title=Don Pedro de Tolède baisant l&amp;#039;épée d&amp;#039;Henri IV &amp;#124; Château de Pau|publisher=chateau-pau.fr|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was painted for Ingres' friend, the artist Jean Alaux.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; It closely replicates the initial composition of the 1814 version: In the background at the left stands a guard; an unidentified figure is exiting at the right. This version was displayed in the 2014 ''L'invention du Passé. Histoires de cœur et d'épée 1802–1850'' exhibition at the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]].

In the third painting (1820; acquired for the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] in 2009),&lt;ref name="latribunedelart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribunedelart.com/premieres-acquisitions-du-louvre-abou-dhabi|title=Premières acquisitions du Louvre-Abou Dhabi - La Tribune de l'Art|publisher=latribunedelart.com|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingres moved the row of caryatids from the left edge of the composition to the center, and reversed the angle of the perspective.&lt;ref name="Radius_96"/&gt; The figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées are once again in the background at the left. The painting was previously in a private collection in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name="gouv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_98=REF&amp;VALUE_98=00000060300|title=Joconde - catalogue - dictionnaires|publisher=culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth version (1832; acquired by the [[Louvre Museum]] in 1981)&lt;ref name="Condon_80-81"&gt;Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). ''In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres''. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. pp. 80–81. {{ISBN|0-9612276-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is slightly smaller than the others. The setting is changed from the Salle des Caryatides to the Stairway of Henri II, and the number of onlookers is augmented by the inclusion of the poet [[François de Malherbe]], Cardinal [[Jacques Davy Duperron]], and an unidentified man.&lt;ref name="Condon_80-81"/&gt;

'''''Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body &amp; Culture''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Routledge]].

In the first editorial, the founding [[editor-in-chief]] [[Valerie Steele]] ([[Fashion Institute of Technology|The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology]]) stated that the journal approaches fashion "as the cultural construction of the embodied identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/136270497779754589 |title=Letter from the Editor |year=1997 |last1=Steele |first1=Valerie |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=1 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal investigates issues of body in society but also includes studies on practices of production, dissemination, and consumption of dress. In addition, it includes reviews of exhibitions and academic publications.

'''''Feet of Flames''''' is an [[Irish dance]] show directed by [[Michael Flatley]] and scored by [[Ronan Hardiman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1464172.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Flatley was known for the shows ''[[Riverdance]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Dance (musical)|Lord of the Dance]]''.

==History==
===Hyde Park 1998===
The Hyde Park show was first created as a one-off performance of Flatley's previous show, "Lord of the Dance". It premiered on 25 July 1998, playing to approximately 25,000 people at the Route of Kings, an open-space arena-like spot in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Although closely resembling its predecessor, this show merged troupes, added new numbers, and featured a multi-level stage for the finale as well as a live band. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo – "Feet of Flames", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by [[Freed's of London]] were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were installed and are now used in all the shows that feature Flatley. Film of the Hyde Park show was later distributed on VHS and DVD.

===2000 World Tour===
On 21 September 1999 Michael Flatley announced a "Feet of Flames" world tour for 2000. This tour began on Wednesday, 1 March 2000, in Germany. The show differed significantly from the original 1998 version. The show had new numbers, new leads, a new story line and a "whole new outlook" in the words of Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Both the original female leads [[Bernadette Flynn]] and [[Gillian Norris]] were replaced by Sarah Clark and [[Leigh Ann McKenna]]. [[Daire Nolan]] was replaced by [[Stephen Brunning]]. Both Daire Nolan and Gillian Norris went on to pursue their own careers after the 1998 show. Bernadette Flynn left to dance with Lord of the Dance troupe one until 2001. Some of the characters changed slightly in the show. Lord of the Dance became Firespirit, Saroise became The Swan and Morrighan the Temptress became Cleopatra. The Dark Lord was remained but there are sayings that they still used Don Dorcha as the name. Helen Egan's part as the little spirit became the Court Jester in the World Tour. The Highlight of the 2000 tour was Flatley and the Troupe performing in [[Budapest]] to over 100,000 people. The European part of the 2000 World Tour concluded on 29 July 2000 in [[Stormont Castle]], [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.

===2001 "Victory Tour"===

The 2001 tour, dubbed the "USA Victory Tour", had a preview show on 6 June 2001 in the [[Bi-Lo Center]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. The tour officially began on 8 June 2001 in the [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida]]. The highlight of the tour was Michael Flatley performing for the first time in [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City on 29 June 2001. The tour ended on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas, Texas]] in the [[American Airlines Center]], the second event to be held at the venue. The last time the show was performed was 29 July 2001. Michael Flatley was said to have retired that night{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but later in 2005 would come out with a new show, [[Celtic Tiger Live|Celtic Tiger]].

===2008 and 2009 Tour===
"Feet of Flames" returned to the world stage for a brief period with lead dancers Damien O' Kane and Bernadette Flynn taking the lead. This would mark the first time in the show's history that Michael Flatley would not be starring or dancing in it. This show featured dances/costumes from 1998 Hyde Park show. Later in 2009 Flatley returned in the lead role.

===2009===
In 2009, Michael Flatley reprised his role in the 2009 tour held in the [[Taipei Arena]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan. It was filmed for DVD and later released as noted in his website. It was also released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk by Playback HD in 2010. The 2009 return of Michael Flatley would later mark his return to his show, Lord of the Dance in 2010. 

==CD, VHS and DVD releases==
[[File:Flatley alone cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Flatley as Lord of the Dance during his return]]
The "Feet of Flames" show from Hyde Park in 1998 was released on VHS and DVD. A CD of the new music from the Hyde park show was released with the DVD. The Budapest show in 2000 was recorded for DVD release but this did not happen; however, clips of the show were put on Michael Flatley's autobiography/concert DVD ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. Included on the DVD are the numbers:

*The Court of High Kings
*Firedance
*Cleopatra's Spell
*Thunder and Lightning
*Stolen Kiss
*The Duel
*Victory March/Victory Dance
*Feet of Flames solo

The [[Madison Square Garden]] show on 29 June 2001 in New York City and the American Airlines Center show on 29 July 2001 in [[Dallas]], Texas, were recorded. The American leg of the tour was filmed for an [[IMAX]] planned for release in 2002. In addition parts of the footage were going to be used in a film featuring Michael Flatley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The working title for the film was supposedly "Dream Dancer", a fictional love story.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Clips of the rehearsal process for the movie can be found on ''[[Michael Flatley Gold]]''. The film was, however, never completed. The original film from the shows in allegedly tied up in ownership dispute between the filming company and Michael Flatley's company [[Unicorn Entertainment]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The 2009 Taiwan tour was filmed for an actual DVD release and later released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in 2010

''Flamingo'' weighs 50 tons, is composed of [[steel]], and is [[vermilion]] in color. Calder gave the stabile its color, which has come to be called "Calder red",&lt;ref name="pag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winterdelights.com/pdfs/publicart.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Chicago Public Art Guide |author=City of Chicago Department of Public Affairs |accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offset it from the black and steel surroundings of nearby office buildings, including the [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]-designed Kluczynski Federal Building.&lt;ref name="higdon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halhigdon.com/picasso/index.htm |author=Higdon, Hal |title=Starting with Picasso: Chicago's Finest Art Isn't All in the Art Institute |accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://antiquesandthearts.com/archive/calder.htm |author=May, Stephen |title=Alexander Calder at the National Gallery of Art |accessdate=2007-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405023716/http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/archive/calder.htm |archivedate=2007-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stabile is an art form which Calder pioneered. It is an abstract structure that is completely stationary, as opposed to a [[mobile (sculpture)|mobile]], which can move with [[air current]]s. In 2012, the sculpture was repainted using the historic "Calder Red" color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sculptureconservation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CALDER-RED-PDF.pdf|title = NOTES FOR A HISTORY OF “CALDER RED” COLOR AND ITS PAINTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN RELATION TO THE RECOATINGS OF ALEXANDER CALDER’S FLAMINGO (1973) AND LA GRANDE VITESSE (1969) AND OTHER CALDER STABILES|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Lodge|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioning and unveiling==
Calder was commissioned to design the sculpture because of his well-established international [[reputation]]; the space, surrounded by rectangular [[modern architecture|modern]] buildings, necessitated the kind of [[arch]]ing forms and dynamic surfaces that a large-scale Calder stabile could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Joan Marter]] |first= |date=July 1979 |title=Alexander Calder's Stabiles: Monumental Public Sculpture in America |journal=American Art Journal |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=75–85 |doi=10.2307/1594168 |jstor=1594168 |publisher=American Art Journal, Vol. 11, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flamingo'' was the first work of art commissioned by the General Services Administration under the federal [[Percent for Art]] program, which allocates a percentage of a project's budget to public art.&lt;ref name="calder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calder.org/SETS/life/life.html |title=Calder Foundation: Calder's Life |accessdate=2007-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416222346/http://www.calder.org/SETS/life/life.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://forecastpublicart.org/anthology-downloads/wetenhall.pdf |format=PDF |last=Wetenhall |first=John |date=Fall–Winter 1993 |title=A Brief History of Percent-for-Art in America |journal=Public Art Review |issue=9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726061624/http://forecastpublicart.org/anthology-downloads/wetenhall.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calder unveiled the model for ''Flamingo'' on April 23, 1973 at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; the sculpture was presented to the public for the first time on October 25, 1974, at the same time that Calder's ''Universe'' mobile was unveiled at what was then known as the Sears Tower (now the [[Willis Tower]]). The day was proclaimed "Alexander Calder Day" and featured a circus parade.&lt;ref name="calder"/&gt;

==Spatial relationships==
[[Image:CalderFlamingo3.jpg|thumb|right|''Flamingo'' as viewed from the Willis Tower skydeck]]

Despite the massive size of the sculpture, its design is such that viewers can walk underneath and around it, thus enabling one to perceive it in human scale.&lt;ref name="pag"/&gt; The shape of ''Flamingo'' alludes to the natural and animal realm, which is a stark contrast to more literal interpretations in sculpture from previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=[[Joan Marter]] |first=|date=July–August 1998 |title=The Legacy of Alexander Calder |magazine=Sculpture |volume=17 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calder's structure is a prominent example of the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] movement, first popularized in Russia in the early 20th century. Constructivism refers to sculpture that is made from smaller pieces which are joined together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hubbard |first=Guy |date=January 2002 |title=Constructivism |magazine=Arts &amp; Activities |volume=130 |issue=6 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[maquette]] of the stabile was formerly displayed inside the Loop Station [[post office]] in the Federal Plaza.&lt;ref name="higdon"/&gt; It currently resides in the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing.

'''Georges Mora''' (June 26, 1913 – June 7, 1992) was a German-born Australian entrepreneur, art dealer, patron, connoisseur and restaurateur.

== Early life ==
Mora was born '''Gunter Morawski''' on June 26, 1913 in [[Leipzig]], Germany, of  Jewish Polish heritage. As a young medical student Mora became a member of a communist cell and fled Germany to Paris in 1930. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Georges left Paris to join the cause. After a plane crash, he was a prisoner of war for a short time. He was active in the [[French Resistance]] in World War II, using the alias Georges Morand. After the War, Georges worked as a patent dealer and became the director of a Jewish rehabilitation home for children run by [[Œuvre de secours aux enfants]] (OSE) in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;unverified account from his biography on the Georges Mora Foundation website [http://www.georgesmorafoundation.org.au/biography.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Later In 1947 he married Parisian artist and fellow Jewish [[refugee]] [[Mirka Mora|Mirka Zelik]], becoming a French citizen.

== New York and Melbourne ==
In 1949, after the birth of Georges' and Mirka's first son [[Philippe Mora]] (a filmmaker) they joined his family in New York, then in July 1951 moved on to McKinnon, Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Thomas, in 'Creative Displacements: Georges Mora, Rudy Komon, Joseph Brown', in ''Art and Australia'', Vol 30 No 4 Winter 1993,  p. 481, recounts that they were attracted to Australia;
"because his wife, Mirka, had read [in] Murger's ''Scènes de la Vie de Bohème'' [of] a character, the photographer Antoine Fauchery, who had been in Melbourne and Mirka declared, 'Melbourne is so attractive to the French'"&lt;/ref&gt; where he adopted the name Georges Mora. With characteristic adaptability he took up management of a [[matzo]] factory. Seeking more romantic quarters Georges and Mirka moved into [[Grosvenor Chambers]] ([[Ola Cohn]]'s former studio) at 9 Collins Street Melbourne (the so called 'Paris End'). Recognising that their hospitality and cuisine were marketable, the Moras opened a coffee lounge. In 1954, 'Mirka Café' was the first in Melbourne where patrons could eat at tables on the pavement in the Parisian style and the café became the watering-hole of Melbourne's avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Thomas. 'Creative Displacements: Georges Mora, Rudy Komon, Joseph Brown', in ''Art and Australia'', Vol 30 No 4 Winter 1993,  p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Creswell, Samantha Trenoweth (2006) ''1001 Australians You Should Know''.

In 1956, Georges Mora was elected President of the [[Contemporary Art Society (Australia)|Contemporary Art Society]]. Artists donated paintings towards an inaugural fundraising exhibition in 1957.  In 1958 he established Café Balzac in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] gaining a reputation as a restaurateur serving classic French cuisine to an eager clientele,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Downes (2003).

The mural was painted as individual panels by three Sydney based 'Annandale Imitation Realists': Colin "Countdown" Lanceley, Mike "Pancho" Brown and Ross "Pride of Day" Crothall in exchange for meals and accommodation. In the 1960's, The Café Balzac was a key artist meeting and eating place in Melbourne, and Ross Crothall's panel has an inscription "To George(sic) Mora, with love."

The rear of the building became a venue for exhibitions of [[avant-garde]] art and was soon surrounded by other galleries.

== Aspendale ==

The Moras' modernist house at bayside [[Aspendale, Victoria|Aspendale]] was regularly visited by artists [[Charles Blackman]], [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]], [[John Perceval]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Joy Hester]], [[John Olsen]], [[Colin Lanceley]], [[Gareth Sansom]], [[Mike Brown (artist)|Mike Brown]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Asher Bilu]] and [[Ivan Durrant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Mora, Mirka | author2=[[Barbara Blackman|Blackman, Barbara]], 1928- (Interviewer) | title=Mirka Mora interviewed by Barbara Blackman | publication-date=1984 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22475297 | accessdate=23 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by prominent journalists and writers Barrett Reid, Brian McArdle and Philip Jones,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jones (2005).

Sons [[William Mora]], born in 1953, and [[Tiriel Mora]] (1958), are respectively an art dealer and an actor.

== Tolarno Galleries ==
In 1969, to avoid bankruptcy, Mora sold the Tolarno hotel and leased out the restaurant and gallery. In the early 1970s he separated from Mirka. In 1979, Georges sold the restaurant to Leon Massoni and relocated the Tolarno Galleries to River Street, [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]].&lt;ref&gt;July 14, 1982, Ivan Durrant, [[Asher Bilu]] and [[Luba Bilu]] made an agreement with Leon Massoni, the new owner of Tolarno restaurant, to take over the old Tolarno Gallery, with [[Ivan Durrant]] to create United Artists Gallery, as an artist-run co-operative (1982 to 1985) which included Mike Brown, Dale Hickey, Don Laycock and Peter D. Cole amongst others&lt;/ref&gt; The opening show there included [[lithographs]] by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] secured through his work as a dealer for [[Daniel Wildenstein]]. Georges travelled to the USA and Europe&lt;ref&gt;John Reed, Barrett Reid and Nancy Underhill, Barrett Reid (Editors) (2001). ''Letters of John Reed: defining Australian cultural life 1920-1981''.

[[William Mora]] joined his father in running the gallery before setting up his own in the city. Jan Minchin, who came from a position at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], was Georges co-director from 1989. Throughout its career, Tolarno Galleries supported challenging contemporary art,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Smith, Terry E. Smith and Christopher Robin Heathcote (Editor) ''Australian painting, 1788-2000'', 4th ed. Oxford University Press, 2001.

In 1985 Georges married artist Caroline Williams when their son, Sam, was born.  Georges was made a [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government in 1989 and he was a strong supporter of the move toward multiculturalism in his adopted country.

== Death ==
On June 7, 1992, at the age of 78, and still energetically running the Tolarno Gallery, Mora died of a brain tumour. He was buried at [[Cheltenham, Victoria|Cheltenham]] New Cemetery, where his grave bears the quip 'Out to Lunch'.

Tolarno continues under the directorship of Jan Minchin in new premises at Level 4, 104 Exhibition Street, Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;not far from the site of ''Mirka Café'' of the 1950s&lt;/ref&gt; George and Mirka's son William Mora continues the family tradition as the director of William Mora Galleries at 60 Tanner St.Richmond.

== The Georges Mora Foundation ==
In Georges' memory [http://www.georgesmorafoundation.org.au/ ''The Georges Mora Foundation''] was established in 2006. It is a not-for-profit cultural foundation dedicated to the promotion of contemporary art and artists in Melbourne and Australia. In May 2006, the foundation was officially launched by Baillieu Myer with inaugural Patron, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. The foundation awards a fellowship each year to a contemporary artist whose work conveys a sense of [[gravitas]]. Georges Mora Foundation Fellowships have been awarded to Jude Walton, Catherine Evans, Inez de Vega, Brook Andrew &amp; Trent Walter, Linda Tegg, Ross Coulter, Philip Brophy, Cyrus Tang &amp; Trinh Vu.

{{nihongo|'''Gocco'''|プリントゴッコ|Purinto Gokko|"Print Gocco"}} is a self-contained compact color printing system invented in 1977 by Noboru Hayama. Gocco became immensely popular in Japan and it is estimated that one-third of Japanese households own a Print Gocco system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Gocco sets included the materials and tools to both make the screens, and to use these screens for printing. As the Gocco screens are quite small, they were most widely used for printing [[greeting card]]s, a popular need within Japanese culture. Gocco could also print to fabrics, although only across a small area. The Gocco printing screens did offer good [[printing registration|registration]], so two or more colour printing was practical and popular.

The name "print gocco" is derived from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{nihongo|''gokko''|[[:ja:ごっこ遊び|ごっこ]]}}, loosely translated as make-believe play. Riso Kagaku president Noboru Hayama explained, "We [as kids] learned rules and knowledge through make-believe play. The spirit of play is an important cultural asset. I thought that I wanted to leave "play" in the product's name."

== Printing method ==
The Gocco process was scaled down, but otherwise very similar to large commercial screen printing techniques. The equipment included simple plastic holders for screen making and printing.

[[Screen printing]] uses a mesh screen that is coated with an impermeable paint-like material to make a stencil of the design. The ink can pass through the bare mesh, but is stopped by the impermeable stencil material. These screens are made by the printer before use, either by painting the stencil material only where it is needed or more commonly, as with the Gocco, by a simple photographic process.

=== Screen making ===
Artwork was prepared as a simple black and white illustration on paper. This could be done by hand, with ink, paint or pencil, or by computer printing (although the original Gocco pre-dated home computer printing). A translucent lightweight paper and a solidly opaque illustration gave better results and sharper prints. It was also possible to use [[photogram]]s, using a natural material such as a [[leaf]] as an artwork of found-materials.

The raw screen was first coated overall with a stencil material. This was then sandwiched with the artwork and the Gocco's simple battery-powered lightbox was used to expose the screen. This used [[Flash (photography)|flash bulbs]] similar to those found in old cameras. The exposed screen could then be developed to wash away the unexposed areas (i.e. those shielded by the artwork), producing a stencil screen.

Where multiple colours were to be printed, a separate screen was made for each colour.

Gocco screens could be used repeatedly. The original patent cites a potential lifetime of 2000 prints, although few Gocco users were interested in such volumes. If cleaned of ink after printing, a screen could also be stored for future printing.

Used screens could be washed clean of the stencil afterwards, re-coated and re-used with new designs.

=== Printing ===
Printing was as for conventional screen printing. The screen and the paper to be printed were sandwiched in the Gocco printing frame. A [[squeegee]] was then used to work a viscous ink around the screen, passing through the mesh in the bare parts of the stencil and onto the paper.

== Decline ==
In December 2005, Gocco’s parent company, [[Riso Kagaku Corporation]], announced it would end production of the Gocco system due to low sales in Japan. An Internet campaign was started to find a new home for the product.

As of June 2007, Riso Kagaku Corporation had resumed production of several lines of Print Gocco units and they were available in Japan and through limited import retail stores in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 30, 2008, the [[Riso Kagaku Corporation]] announced that it would stop shipping Gocco printers in June 2008. It blamed the sharp decline in demand for its printers on the increase in use of home computers and printers. It was to continue producing supplies for the printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invites one curator from the chosen region to the [[Solomon R Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]] for a two-year curatorial residency, where he or she works with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities.&lt;ref name=vogel3&gt;Vogel, Carol.

Reverend '''Humphrey Gainsborough''' (1718 – 23 August 1776) was an English [[non-conformist]] [[Religious minister|minister]], [[engineer]], and [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tyler, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=Tyler  |first=David
  |title=Humphrey Gainsborough, 1718–1776: Cleric, Engineer and Inventor
  |journal=[[Transactions of the Newcomen Society]]
  |issue=76
  |pages=51–81
  |year=2006}} Read to the [[Newcomen Society]] at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], [[London]], 12 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphrey Gainsborough was [[pastor]] to the Independent Church in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[England]]. He was the brother of the artist [[Thomas Gainsborough]]. He invented the [[drill plough]] (1766), winning a prize of £60 from the [[Royal Society]] for his efforts. He also invented the [[tide mill]] (1761), which allowed a [[mill wheel]] to rotate in either direction, winning a £50 prize from the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society for the Encouragement of Arts]] in [[London]]. In addition, he designed a self-ventilating fish wagon (1762).

[[File:Conway Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 722320.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Conway's Bridge]], designed by Humphrey Gainsborough and built in 1763 at [[Park Place (Berkshire)|Park Place]], named after [[Henry Seymour Conway]] (1721–1795)]]
Gainsborough designed [[Conway's Bridge]], built in 1763 at [[Park Place (Berkshire)|Park Place]] close to Henley, an interesting rustic arched stone structure that still carries traffic on the road between [[Wargrave]] and Henley today. In 1768, he improved the slope on the road up the steep White Hill to the east of Henley, straightening it in the process.

In the 1760s, Gainsborough showed a model of a condensing [[steam engine]] to [[James Watt]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Watt had been working independently on improvements to the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen "atmospheric engine"]] and subsequently [[patent]]ed these in 1769. He perhaps included some of – and at least built on – Gainsborough's ideas. Gainsborough is thus probably less well-known than he might have been.

The [[canal lock|lock]], [[weir]] and [[footbridge]] at [[Marsh Lock]], just upstream from Henley on the [[River Thames]], were designed by Gainsborough, together with other early locks from [[Sonning]] to [[Maidenhead]] (1772–73).

A [[blue plaque]] in Gainsborough's honour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/gainsborough.html | title=Humphrey Gainsborough (1718–1776) | publisher=[[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme]] | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be found in the town of [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]] itself on the gates of the Manse, the house where he lived next to the Christ Church [[United Reformed Church]]. Inside he designed an early [[security chain]] and plate on one of the outside doors, allowing the door to be partially opened, that is still there now. Similar designs are used on many people's front doors today.

==Epitaph==
[[Philip Thicknesse]] wrote in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1785:

According to [[AllMusic]], Kekal was one of the first heavy metal bands from Indonesia to make international inroads,&lt;ref name=Allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=kekal-mn0001545395|pure_url=yes}} |title= Kekal |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to sociologist of heavy metal, [[Keith Kahn-Harris]], was one of the few [[extreme metal]] bands from [[Southeast Asia]] to ever make more than a minimal impression on the global scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Keith Kahn|title=Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge|year=2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=0-85785-221-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j498eOosXxEC&amp;pg=PT334&amp;dq=kekal+band#v=onepage&amp;q=kekal%20band&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by two musicians known simply Yeris and Newbabe, the band underwent some shifts in lineup in its early years, but emerged with a consistent lineup of three key-members, guitarist/vocalist [[Jeff Arwadi]], bassist [[Azhar Levi Sianturi]], and guitarist [[Leo Setiawan]]. Frequently labeled as [[black metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[experimental metal|avant-garde metal]], Kekal plays a very diverse range of music styles within the frame of metal and rock, incorporating many other music genres such as [[ambient music|ambient]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[progressive rock]]. Over the course of its career, Kekal has transitioned from a heavy metal-based style to a more experimental and electronic sound.

Throughout its entire career, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums, three EPs, several compilations and contributions to various collaborative albums, and in 2004 engaged in a successful [[Europe]]an mini-tour. As of 12 August 2009, all key-members have officially left Kekal, but continue to contribute material. Though the band currently has no official members, former members of the band contributed to an eighth studio album entitled ''[[8 (Kekal album)|8]]'' which was officially released in 2010, ninth studio album entitled ''[[Autonomy (album)|Autonomy]]'' in 2012, tenth studio album ''Multilateral'' in 2015 and eleventh studio album ''Deeper Underground'' in 2018.

==History==

===Early years (formation to 2002)===
The early history of Kekal started out in 1990, when 16-year-old musician [[Jeff Arwadi]] formed a self-styled "[[Punk rock|punk]]ish [[thrash metal]]" band called Obliteration with some of his high school friends, but Jeff quit this group in 1991 to better learn guitar.&lt;ref name=AlteraBio&gt;{{cite web |author=Altera Enigma |title=Bio : Band History and Introduction - Jefray "Jeff" Arwadi : Guitars, Vocals |date=25 December 2010 |url=http://www.alteraenigma.com/index.php/bio |work= |publisher=Altera Enigma |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archaic /&gt; Kekal was officially formed on 15 August 1995, by two friends, simply named under pseudonyms Yeris and Newbabe (the latter revealed years later as Newin Atmarumeksa), as a more straightforward [[extreme metal]] band. The name Kekal was coined by Newbabe, and is Indonesian for 'Immortal' or 'Eternal'. The band was intended as a one time project, and recruited a vocalist known simply as "Harry" to help record a four-song demo tape. This demo began to circulate and caught the attention of future guitarist Leo, who had gained experience in a [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] [[cover band]].&lt;ref name=ChronChaos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-220_kekal.aspx |title= Beyond a Glimpse of Borneo - An interview with Kekal |author=Cantwell, Alex |date=14 March 1999 |work=Chronicles of Chaos |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Corazine&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uNofLR2u?url=http://www.corazine.com/articles/k/kekal/interviews/interview.aspx |date=20 November 2010 }} Archived from the [http://www.corazine.com/articles/k/kekal/interviews/interview.aspx original], 2010-11-20 09:36:11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jefftalkaboutalbums /&gt;

In June 1996, [[Azhar Sianturi]] joined Kekal and the band recorded its official demo, entitled ''Contra Spiritualia Nequitiae'', using the songwriting and production talents of Jeff Arwadi, who was also a member of the group Inner Warfare. According to Jeff, the demo was recorded in his bedroom with only a [[Fostex]] X-28 [[4-track recorder|4-track]] [[tape recorder]] and $2 [[karaoke]] microphone.&lt;ref name=jefftalkaboutalbums&gt;{{cite web|title=In-depth interview with Jeff about the first 7 Kekal albums &amp; much more.|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150569857124763|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=9 March 2012|author=Kekal|date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of underground [[tape trading]] circles and local [[fanzine]]s, the demo soon caught the attention of the metal scene outside Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and few record labels began offering deals. Later that year [[Leo Setiawan]] joined the band, and in April 1997 Kekal began to record its self-produced debut album, ''[[Beyond the Glimpse of Dreams]]'', released in 1998. The album was licensed to and released by two record labels, allowing for Kekal to be known internationally, especially in the underground metal circles around Europe and North America. Harry left the band after this recording, and the remaining trio released ''[[Embrace the Dead]]'' the next year. Jeff has expressed disappointment with this album, both in the stylistic direction, which was intentionally designed to appeal to a more mainstream audience,&lt;ref name=jefftalkaboutalbums /&gt; and in the recording sessions, which would inspire the title of the band's next album, ''[[The Painful Experience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arwadi, Jeff |title=Available for Free Download (Limited to 1000 downloads) - Embrace The Dead 1999 - remastered re-issue |date=13 August 2010 |url=http://www.facebook.com/notes/kekal/available-for-free-download-limited-to-1000-downloads-embrace-the-dead-1999-rema/423341394762 |work= |publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=5 January 2011}} Transcribed from the liner notes to the ''[[Introduce Us to Immortality]]'' compilation.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the band contributed to a [[Living Sacrifice]] tribute album with a cover of that band's song "Mind Distant".&lt;ref name=blabberpainful&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive News|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/archive-news-aug-20-2001/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|accessdate=8 August 2011|date=20 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, the band's third album, ''The Painful Experience'', was released. Leo Setiawan left the band before the recording sessions and moved to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], but he was still listed on the album credits as a guitarist due to his contribution on the album's songwriting and general concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://powermetal.de/content/artikel/show-KEKAL__Interview_mit_Jeff,5017.html |title=KEKAL: Interview mit Jeff |author=Lang, Stefan |date=6 January 2002 |publisher=Powermetal.de |accessdate=12 February 2011 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the band was reduced to a duo, and collaborated with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] band [[Slechtvalk]] to record a split album entitled ''[[Chaos &amp; Warfare]]'',&lt;ref name=chaoswar&gt;{{cite web|last=Born|first=R.|title=Slechtvalk|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/netherlands/haag/slechtvalk|publisher=[[MusicMight]]|accessdate=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916205510/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/netherlands/haag/slechtvalk|archivedate=16 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also recorded a cover of "[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]" for the compilation album ''Brutal Christmas: The Season in Chaos''.&lt;ref name=covertunes&gt;{{cite web|title=Flashback, 15 Years of Kekal (1995–2010) - Part VI: Cover Tunes|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=445909499762|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=9 March 2012|author=Kekal|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, the band played a string of shows in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=HMBobfest /&gt;&lt;ref name=JesusMetal&gt;{{cite web|author=JesusMetal |title=Interview with Kekal |date=10 April 2004 |url=http://users.telenet.be/jesusmetal/interview15.htm |work= |publisher=JesusMetal |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018235013/http://users.telenet.be/jesusmetal/interview15.htm |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HMmag /&gt; and was featured in the Dutch magazine ''Aardschok''.&lt;ref name=aardschok&gt;{{cite web|last=van Eijk|first=Oscar|title=De Aardschok in Maart 2004|url=http://www.aardschok.com/inhoud/61-de-aardschok-in-maart-2004|work=Aardschok|accessdate=11 June 2012|language=Dutch|date=1 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year also saw the release of ''Spirits of the Ancient Days'', a collection of early Kekal demo songs.&lt;ref name=Discs /&gt; 
Upon return to Indonesia, Kekal was back in the studio to record a fifth album ''[[Acidity (album)|Acidity]]'' which included guest musician [[Didi Priyadi]] on guitars, as well as playing some local shows with him as an additional live guitarist. ''Acidity'' was released in 2005 and was an official reunion album for the band, which marked the return of Leo, and a vocal contribution by founding member Newbabe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kekal.org/album-acidity.php |title=Acidity |author=Kekal |date= |work=Kekal Discography |publisher=Kekal.org |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acidity'' was well received, and Kekal was again noted by "Psych Folk" Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playlist "Psyche van het folk" Radio Centraal, Antwerpen|url=http://psychevanhetfolk.homestead.com/files/improv.txt|work="Psych Folk" Radio|accessdate=12 June 2012|date=13 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the band started recording their sixth album, ''[[The Habit of Fire]]''. In 2006, Jeff leaked two cover songs, "The Prow", originally by [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], and "Juices Like Wine", originally by [[Celtic Frost]], both of which were recorded in 2005.&lt;ref name=covertunes /&gt;&lt;ref name=meandeviation /&gt;

===Jeff's move to Canada (2006–2008)===
In 2006, right after the recording of ''[[The Habit of Fire]]'', founding member Jeff Arwadi moved to [[Canada]] while the rest of the members were in Indonesia, leaving the band unable to play shows and do touring. At the same time they left their longtime record label Fear Dark and status of the band was in question. After few months of uncertainty and rumors of break-up went around among their fans, they all decided to remain together and to keep the band only as a studio project.

===Departure of band members (2009)===
In March 2009, Azhar Levi decided to step down from Kekal. Jeff Arwadi said that although this closed a door, Kekal would continue as a musical unit in a "new era" of the band's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/news_update_week_ending_322200903/index.php |title=HM Magazine news update page |author=HM Staff |year=2009 |work= |publisher=[[HM Magazine]] |accessdate=26 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610094213/http://www.hmmagazine.com/2009/07/news-update-week-ending-3-22/|archivedate=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2009, Jeff announced that he and Leo had left Kekal, and that the name would continue but without active members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/2009/07/news-update-week-ending-3-22/ |title=HM Magazine news update |author=Van Pelt, Doug |date=March 2009 |work= |publisher=[[HM Magazine]] |accessdate=26 August 2010|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090322130307/http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/news_update_week_ending_322200903|archivedate=22 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, as well as unspecified personal reasons, he decided to leave the band because, after being closer to nature and in a less densely populated city in Canada, he was unable to continue to make dark and angry metal music which he did in the past with Kekal. Shortly after, Kekal put up an offer of three albums for free download on its website, including its best-selling album to date, ''1000 Thoughts of Violence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/2009/08/free-downloads-of-3-kekal-albums/ |title=Free downloads of 3 KEKAL albums |author=Van Pelt, Doug |date=August 2009 |work= |publisher=[[HM Magazine]] |accessdate=26 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827193457/http://www.hmmagazine.com/2009/08/free-downloads-of-3-kekal-albums/|archivedate=27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kekal.org/freedownloads.php |title=Official Website |author=Kekal |date= |work=Kekal |publisher=Kekal.org |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its fans perceived that Kekal had technically split-up/disbanded at the moment band leader Jeff announced his departure from the band, despite the fact that Kekal as an institution still existed and the institution itself was not affected by any founding member leaving. To end the confusions among the fans, the band issued a statement posted on its official Facebook page: "KEKAL IS NOT DEAD!!!! When Jeff left Kekal it doesn't mean the band is dead!"&lt;ref name=Kekalnotdead&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/kekalofficial/posts/133766644813 |title=KEKAL IS NOT... |author=Kekal |date=15 September 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's MySpace and Facebook pages are still active and currently being moderated mainly by volunteers from the band's Street Team members, as well as Azhar and Jeff themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/kekal/blog/506603330 |title=FREE DOWNLOADS of 3 KEKAL ALBUMS! |author=Kekal |date=21 August 2009 |work=Kekal |publisher=Kekal.org |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kekal has identified itself with the [[punk rock]] and early 1980s metal scenes, and considers itself a "street-progressive" band that is aesthetically more akin to [[Sonic Youth]] or [[The Mars Volta]] than to technically oriented bands like [[Dream Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Necrowild, Willy |title=KEKAL - In-depth interview No.&amp;nbsp;1|date=24 February 2005 |url=http://nekroblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/kekal-in-depth-interview-1.html |work=NekroBlog |publisher=[[Blogspot]] |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band claims roots in 1980s forms of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] as pioneered by bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]], [[Helloween]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], and [[Massacre (metal band)|Massacre]].&lt;ref name=Original&gt;{{cite web|author=Niethan |title=There is an original violent tendency in our human nature |date=17 December 2003 |url=http://www.archaic-magazine.com/article.php?aid=38603 |work= |publisher=Archaic Magazine |accessdate=8 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005052820/http://www.archaic-magazine.com/article.php?aid=38603 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimebag Darrell]] and [[Quorthon]] have also been cited as influences.&lt;ref name=Archaic&gt;{{cite web |author=Neithan |title=Music is very unique and personal |date=2 June 2005 |url=http://www.archaic-magazine.com/article.php?aid=38991 |work= |publisher=Archaic Magazine |accessdate=8 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005052807/http://www.archaic-magazine.com/article.php?aid=38991|archivedate=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Kekal has cited an influence from many styles of music and now lists a large host of artists as an inspiration, including [[A-ha]], [[Amebix]], [[Autechre]], [[Björk]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore]], [[Camel (band)|Camel]], Celtic Frost, [[Cocteau Twins]], [[Chick Corea]], [[The Cure]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Gazebo (musician)|Gazebo]], [[Godflesh]], Iron Maiden, [[Joy Division]], [[Killing Joke]], [[King Crimson]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mantronix]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Merzbow]], [[Pat Metheny]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Napalm Death]], [[Outkast]], [[Pan Sonic]], [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Police]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], [[Radiohead]], [[Red Snapper (band)|Red Snapper]], [[Return to Forever]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], Sonic Youth, [[Squarepusher]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Amon Tobin]], Trouble, and [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]].&lt;ref name="Kekal Pinterest Page"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kekal |title=Kekal - Influential Albums |url=http://pinterest.com/kekalofficial/influential-albums/ |publisher=[[Pinterest]] |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting and recording techniques===
Jeff has stated that starting from the album ''The Painful Experience'' they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call "hybrid drums", a mix of real-time performance and software-based [[matrix decoder|matrix]] programming.&lt;ref name=avantgardemetal&gt;{{cite web |author=Assassin, Andreas (aVoid) and Niederwieser, Chrystof |title=The Light At The End Of The Tunnel |date=24 August 2007 |url=http://www.avantgarde-metal.com/content/stories2.php?id=17 |work= |publisher=Avant-Garde Metal |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: "About the drummer, it is still very hard to find a right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very [[extreme metal|extreme-metal]] with [[blast beats]] and fast [[double bass drum|double-kicks]], to powerful [[rock music|rock]] beats that demand steady tempo, and to some [[polyrhythm]]ic playing and [[time-signature]] shifts in the characteristics of jazz and [[progressive rock|prog]] drumming. We would need 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why the best thing for the recording is to make the hybrid drumming."&lt;ref name=Original /&gt; In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of ''The Habit of Fire'', starting from collecting [[sampling (music)|samples]] and creating [[MIDI]] information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, [[synthesizer]]s, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals.&lt;ref name=Ultimate&gt;{{cite web |author=Garwood, Russell |url=http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/interviews/322438-kekal-urban-experimentation.html |title=Kekal - Urban Experimentation |date= |work=Ultimate Metal Forum |publisher=Ultimate Metal |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff also mentioned during the interview about the 2011 Futuride EP, that he has experimented with [[additive synthesis]] on the recent songs he has recorded and uses guitars to counterbalance the sounds generated by the additive synthesis.&lt;ref name="Futuride"/&gt;

==Ethics and ideological stance==

===Kekal and Anarchism===
Kekal claims to have practiced [[Anarchism]] since the beginning of its career, which in their own words "translates to non-hierarchical and anti-authoritarian approach to self-governing/self-managing", including voluntary contribution, [[Free association (communism and anarchism)| free association]] and a strong [[DIY ethic]].&lt;ref name=anarchism&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kekalofficial/photos/a.421281954541.223571.8716024541/10155200617284542/?type=3&amp;permPage=1|title=Kekal: Anarchism &amp; DIY Ethic|publisher=Kekal|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kekal never grants copyrights of the band's recording masters to any record labels (since 2010 all the music have been published through [[Creative Commons license]]&lt;ref name=anarchism /&gt;) and has 100% artistic control over music, production and artwork.&lt;ref name=Ultimate /&gt; Kekal has recorded and produced most of its albums in its own studio/workstation, manages the band itself, does its own photo sessions, and designs its own [[album artwork]] and covers. As Jeff stated, "So far, we've been known as an independent band who never want to get signed by record label, to maintain our independency and control over our artistic freedom, and also to own our recording masters and copyright.. Instead of band signing, we always prefer to license our finished albums to record labels."&lt;ref name=avantgardemetal /&gt;

===Kekal and Christianity===
Kekal has been described by AllMusic as one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name=Allmusic /&gt; However, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a [[Christian metal]] band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of [[elitism]] and [[exclusivism]] in today's culture.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; In a 2005 interview with ''[[HM Magazine]]'', Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band."&lt;ref name=HMmag&gt;{{cite web|author=Larson, Mike |title=Heaven's Metal Kekal Interview |year=2005 |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/heavens_metal_kekal_interview200506/index.php |work=Heaven's Metal Fanzine |publisher=[[HM Magazine]] |accessdate=8 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610095252/http://www.hmmagazine.com/exclusive/heavens_metal_kekal_interview200506/index.php |archivedate=10 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 2005 interview, Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jasper|title=Kekal &amp;#124; Interview|url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1059&amp;lang=en|work=Lords of Metal E-zine Issue 51|date=September 2005 |publisher=Lords of Metal E-zine|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Arwadi, in particular, has expressed his belief in Christianity that is not a religion. During the 2017 interview, he considered himself as a [[Christian anarchism|Christian Anarchist]], and mentioned that he personally opposes the concept of religion, its dogma and hierarchical structure of authority within the church organization. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] is cited as a big influence in shaping his concept of faith and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed of God - The Discussion|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/kekal/10155335364219763/|date=June 2017 |publisher=Kekal|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, does not have to be associated with religion whatsoever.&lt;ref name="avantgardemetal"/&gt;

The '''Lothair Crystal''' (also known as the '''Lothar Crystal''' or the '''Susanna Crystal''') is an [[engraved gem]] from [[Lotharingia]] in North-West Europe, showing scenes of the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], dating from 855-869.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx |title=Lothair Crystal |author=British Museum |date= |work=[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]] |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120100557/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lothair Crystal is an object in the collection of the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The original element of the work is a circular disc of clear [[quartz]] ("rock crystal"), measuring {{convert|11.5|cm|in}} in diameter.  This is engraved in [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] with eight scenes depicting the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] and the Elders, related in the [[Book of Daniel]] (but regarded as part of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] by Protestants).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Centuries of European Civilization|author1=Brown, Louise Fargo|author2=Carson, George Barr|page=127b|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8369-2100-7|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanna is first shown being falsely accused and condemned for adultery by the elders. [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] intervenes to question the elders, uncovers their false witness and engineers their execution by stoning. In the final scene, Susanna is declared to be innocent. The scenes are accompanied by brief [[titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] in [[Latin language|Latin]] drawn from the [[Vulgate|Vulgate Bible]].&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt;

The engravings on the crystal are executed in the energetic and distinctive early mediæval Rheims style which originated in [[manuscript]] drawings such as those in the [[Utrecht Psalter]].&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; The crystal is surrounded by a 15th-century gilt-copper mount with a foliage border,&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt; which was once attributed to [[Saint Eligius]] (c. 588 – 660), the [[patron saint]] of [[goldsmith]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford-Western Art" /&gt;

==Dating==
The crystal is inscribed ''LOTHARIVS REX FRANCORVM IVSSIT'' ("Lothair, King of the [[Franks]], caused [this to be made]"&lt;ref name="ahotw_episode"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lothair Crystal|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/4jY66b8hQumUbeudll4R_w|work=A History of the World|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), apparently [[Lothair II]], or "Lothar" in German.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; The elder Lothair styled himself ''[[imperator]]'' (emperor), whereas the younger man only called himself ''rex'' (king), as does the owner of the crystal; it is therefore probable that it was created in Lothair II's time, probably around the middle of the 9th century, making it a late example of [[Carolingian art]].&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt;

==History==
Nothing is known of the history of the Lothair Crystal prior to the 10th century. Around this time, it was pawned between a [[count]] and a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Rheims]] in exchange for a horse. The canon then denied possession of the crystal.&lt;ref name="francis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treasures of the British Museum|year=1971|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=0-500-20119-6|editor=[[Frank Francis|Francis, Sir Frank]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered to be in his possession when the canon was smoked out of the cathedral when it was set alight.  In [[penance]], he founded [[Waulsort Abbey]] (in modern [[Belgium]]), where the crystal was held until the 18th century. During part of this period, it was utilised by the abbots to fasten their [[cope]]s during mass.

In 1793, [[French Revolution|revolutionary French]] forces sacked Waulsort and threw the crystal into the [[Meuse]] river, reputedly cracking it in the process.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; In the 19th century it was stolen and stripped of its jewels.&lt;ref name="francis" /&gt;  It reappeared in the hands of a Belgian dealer, who claimed it had been retrieved from the river bed and sold it to a French collector for twelve [[franc]]s. It passed to the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Ralph Bernal]], who paid [[Pound sterling|£]]10 for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Morris and the Middle Ages: a collection of essays, together with a catalogue of works exhibited at the Whitworth Art Gallery, 28 September-8 December 1984|pages=65–66|author1=Banham, Joanna|author2=Harris, Jennifer|isbn=978-0-7190-1721-6|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 it was acquired by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] on behalf of the British Museum in an auction of Bernal's collection at [[Christie's]] for £267.&lt;ref name="BM catalogue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=59031&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=lothair+crystal&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1|title=The Lothair Crystal|author=British Museum|work=British Museum catalogue|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Franks, Augustus Wollaston."

The Lothair Crystal was Object 53 in the 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', chosen and presented by the Director of the British Museum, [[Neil MacGregor]].

==Interpretation==
[[File:Lothair Crystal detail.gif|thumb|300px|Enhanced image of the engraving.]]
The crystal is one of a small number of Carolingian engraved gems created for the circles around the court, although its form does not closely resemble any of the others.  A gem with Lothair's portrait that was probably his personal seal was set a hundred years after his death into the processional [[Cross of Lothair]] in [[Aachen Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, Peter, ''Ars Sacra, 800-1200'', Yale University Press, 1995 (2nd edn.) {{ISBN|978-0300060485}}; [http://farm1.static.flickr.com/92/214980020_e621f556a1.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of interpretations have been advanced for the crystal's function as well as its meaning and significance to the Lotharingian court; its meaning is unclear and it has been the subject of ongoing controversy among scholars.&lt;ref name="Ness"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early medieval art|last=Nees|first=Lawrence|pages=239–41|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-284243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject matter of the crystal suggests that it was meant to be shown at court as a symbol of the king's role in the dispensation of justice.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; Its design may be an allusion to the breastplate of justice worn by the [[Kohen Gadol]] (the Jewish High Priest).&lt;ref name="Oxford-Western Art"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Kemp, Martin|title=The Oxford history of Western art|publisher=Oxford University Press US|page=94|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-860012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this interpretation, the crystal may have been an attempt to show visually the ruler's responsibility to provide justice, using a biblical parallel to exhort him to uphold the ideal of wise rule exemplified by the just kings of the Old Testament. Alternatively, the subject of the crystal symbolises an idealised relationship between Church and state, with Susanna representing the Church being protected from her enemies by the just decisions of the ruler.&lt;ref name="Ness" /&gt;

[[Valerie Flint]] has argued that the crystal is related to the acrimonious divorce of Lothair and his wife Theutberga, whom he accused of committing [[incest]] and practicing [[abortion]]. It depicts the vindication of a wife falsely accused of a sexual crime, and the type of rock crystal from which it is made was used by the [[Franks]] as an amulet. Flint suggests that the crystal was designed in 865, when Lothar had a temporary reconciliation with his wife, to serve both as a reproach to the king for his conduct and as a charm to protect the royal couple against evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rider|first=Caroline|title=Magic and impotence in the Middle Ages|page=35|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-928222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mains d’Œuvres''' (Manpower) is a [[not-for-profit arts organization]] based in [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. The organization supports contemporary art by coordinating residencies for emerging artists and by programming exhibitions and events.

==History==
Mains d’Œuvres is situated in a refurbished [[Valeo]] car factory, which was used as an employee community and sports center until the company sold the building in 1991. In 1991, four organizations: Usines Ephemeres, TransEuropeHalles network, Vecam and Europe 99, combined to create Mains d'Œuvres. A pioneer of its time, Mains d'Œuvres spearheaded the widespread phenomenon in Europe during the 1990s, which consisted of turning factories into placed dedicated to new, inventive art forms.

A 4000 square metre Mains d’Œuvres arts centre opened in Saint-Ouen in 2001.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news|author=Alice Pfeiffer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/arts/16iht-rartbanlieue.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Beyond the Paris Limits, a Cutting Edge |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Attributing its outlook to [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s [[Difference and Repetition]], Mains d’Œuvres describes itself as, "Sensual and intellectual, specialist and non-specialist...an experimental art space open to everyone." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainsdoeuvres.org/article830.html |title=Visual Arts - Mains d’Œuvres |publisher=Mainsdoeuvres.org |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering visual and digital arts, music, dance, theater, cinema, lectures and educational events to the public, the organization is supported by the Conseil général de la Seine-Saint-Denis, Ministère de la Culture (France), and the [[Ministère de la Jeunesse et des Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainsdoeuvres.org/rubrique66.html |title=le lieu - Mains d’Œuvres |publisher=Mainsdoeuvres.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Mains d’Œuvres is most recognized for its offerings in the field of music. Concerts, parties, and residency programs establish the organization on an international field. Residencies are open to a wide range of styles such as electronic, rap, and world music. Due to the approach of creating ties between all styles, Mains d’Œuvres offers a venue open to all musical experimentation. Notable musicians who have worked with, or at Main d'Œuvres include: [[Herman Dune]], Etienne Jaumet, [[:fr:Cheveu (groupe)|Cheveu]] and [[:fr:Frustration (groupe)|Frustration]].

==Digital art==
The Craslab is offered by Mains d’Œuvres for members of the public interested in learning and testing real-time interaction technologies. CrasLab tutors offer educative classes focusing on [[open-source hardware]] and [[free software]] to the likes of Freeduino and [[Pure data]]. Consecutively in 2006, 2007, and 2008, Mains d'Œuvres hosted The Mal Au Pixel festival of electronic art and subcultures, presenting original experiences based on interactive and participative works, hybrid performances, concerts and other unexpected encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelache.ac/2007/2006-2/pixelache-paris/ |title=Pixelache 2005-2007 » NEWS |publisher=Pixelache.ac |date=2006-04-29 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance==
Mains d’Œuvres offers dance residency programs that are open to projects which are singular in their research as well as in their attempt to (re)question or rethink society and the art of choreography. Two types of choreographic residency-programs exist at Mains d’Œuvres: long term (3 years) and project based (approx. 1 year). Currently, there are four long-term residency and six project-based companies. Yearly, six to eight dance pieces are presented publicly. The dance residency program at Mains d’Œuvres aims to render companies financially &amp; professionally autonomous and publicly acclaimed. Notable past residents include: Cindy Van Acker, Perrine Vally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perrinevalli.fr/html_en/projets_femmeforet.htm |title=Perrine Valli |publisher=Perrinevalli.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and François Laroche Valière.

==Theatre==
Mains d’Œuvres offers a residency program for theatre companies to develop off-mainstream research, different from the classical stage sets. Artists are guided through the whole creation progress. Principally a space for thinking and experimenting theatre, the venue also publicly presents the supported projects in order to bring the artist public and professional recognition. Yearly, up to five companies take part in a two or one-year residency program, and up to six pieces are presented publicly.

==Visual art==
Mains d'Oeuvres has held several exhibitions showcasing artists such as [[Wim Delvoye]], [[Thomas Hirschhorn]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Jon Bernad]], [[Neil Beloufa]], Pauline Bastard, Ivan Argote, [[Dominique Blais]], Etienne Jaumet, [[Herman Dune]], and Marie Hendriks. Isabelle Le Normand was curator there between 2008 and 2013. Anne Stouvenel took over as curator in 2013.

'''Nuit Blanche''' ({{IPA-fr|nɥi ˈblɑ̃ʃ}}) ('''White Night''') is an annual all-night or night-time [[arts festival]]. A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public [[art gallery|art galleries]], and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a ''de facto'' art gallery, providing space for [[art installation]]s, performances (music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkabilly.ca/nuit-blanche-2016-toronto-punk-show/|title=Nuit Blanche Punk Rock Show|publisher=punkabilly.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.

In 1989, the [[Helsinki Festival]] established its [[Night of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginjuhlaviikot.fi/en/taiteiden-yo|title=Taiteiden yö|work=Helsingin juhlaviikot}}&lt;/ref&gt; "when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofestivals.co.uk/festivals-in-finland/helsinki-festival/|title=Helsinki Festival|publisher=eurofestivals.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the mayor of Nantes, [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]]'s program included renovating the central city and establishing a "contemporary patrimony", which led arts programmer [[Jean Blaise]] to create a late-night cultural festival, "Les Allumées" ("Things Alight").&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf Alliance Française of New Zealand, May 2009 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325211624/http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, over six years with artists from six cities.&lt;ref name="Nantes"&gt;[http://www.nantes.fr/les-allumees Les Allumées (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear left}}

They were as follows:
* [[Barcelona]], 15–20 October 1990
* [[St. Petersburg]], 14–19 October 1991
* [[Buenos Aires]], 19–24 October 1992
* [[Naples]], 18–23 October 1993
* [[Cairo]], 17–22 October 1994
* [[Havana]], 16–21 October 1995. (The Cuban government refused to issue travel documents to the 300 artists expected, so the event was formally cancelled, though events did take place.)&lt;ref name="Nantes"/&gt;

In 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual [[White Nights Festival]] in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included [[popular culture|pop culture]] (e.g. the [[Rolling Stones]] in the open air at [[Palace Square]]) in 2007 and [[high culture]] events ("Stars of the White Nights Festival" at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] under [[Valery Gergiev]]) every year since 1993.

In 1997, the [[Long Night of Museums]], took place in the [[German reunification|newly re-united]] [[Berlin]] with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.

In 2001, when [[Bertrand Delanoë]] became [[Mayor of Paris]], his deputy, Christophe Girard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christophe-girard.fr/a-propos/|title=Présentation|work=christophe-girard.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 History of Nuit Blanche (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906073353/http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. "The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/english/visit/highlights/nuit-blanche/rub_8208_stand_34123_port_18969|title=Nuit Blanche|author=Mairie de Paris|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as "Nuits Blanches Europe". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutrio.be/nuit-blanche-9th-edition-0|title=Nuit blanche – 9th edition – Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union|work=eutrio.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Melbourne]] hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, [[Melbourne laneways|laneways]], shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/4156-white-night-melbourne-celebrating-our-city-from-dusk-to-dawn.html?qh=YTozOntpOjA7czo1OiJ3aGl0ZSI7aToxO3M6Nzoid2hpdGVseSI7aToyO3M6Nzoid2hpdGluZyI7fQ%3D%3D Premier of Victoria's Press Release: White Night Melbourne – celebrating our city from dusk to dawn]&lt;/ref&gt; This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/white-night-an-arty-delight-20130224-2ezot.html|title=White Night an arty delight|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-avignon.org/en/contribution-nuit-blanche-made-paris-concept-exported-latin-america-margot-beck|title=Contribution: "Nuit Blanche, the made in Paris concept exported in Latin America" by Margot Beck – Forum d'Avignon|publisher=forum-avignon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the "Noche en Blanco" was made between 2013 and 2015.

'''Nurzhol Boulevard''' (Kazakh: бульвар «Нұржол» Bulvar Nurzhol, formerly known as «сулы-нулы бульвар» Green Water Boulevard) is the national boulevard of [[Kazakhstan]], a pedestrian area in the new business and administrative centre on the left bank of [[Ishim river]], in the capital, [[Astana]].  The Boulevard is one of the main attractions of the city and country.&lt;ref&gt; Kazakhstan - Page 99 Paul Brummell - 2012 "On the east side of the square, as Nurzhol Boulevard continues its eastward march, is the fountain composition ... Around the [[Ak Orda]] At the east end of Nurzhol Boulevard are two tall conical buildings, faced in a covering of reflective gold. North and south of these a large, curving, wall-like building, which houses various government ministries and agencies, essentially serves to enclose the space to its east, up to the bank of the River Ishim beyond."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Asia - Page 176 Bradley Mayhew, Greg Bloom, Paul Clammer - 2010 "Back on Nurzhol bulvar &lt;/ref&gt; Both Nurzhol Boulevard and the layout of the city were designed by renowned architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]]. The boulevard runs from the President's residence [[Ak Orda]] to the marquee shaped [[Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center]] (Хан Шатыр).&lt;!--Please fix this sloppy text: In large part Boulevard is a three-level structure. At the lower level parking lot located at 400 cars. On average, the second level there are shops, points of the service sector and public catering, exhibition halls, offices and other public institutions. On the upper level paved pedestrian area with the proper paths, flower beds, lawns, trees, benches, fountains, small architectural forms. In six areas (zones "green house") conical atria top-level form of light "wells" of natural light, around which are arranged interlevel ladders and winter gardens. In some places, the second level of indoor galleries and passages leading to surrounding buildings.--&gt;
 
Along the boulevard there is a row of buildings designed by well-known domestic and foreign architects, including the city's most recognisable structure, the [[Bayterek]]. &lt;!--More sloppy text to fix: We are building the boulevard government agencies, including the Government of the RK, RK Senate, the Majilis of the RK, the Supreme Court of the RK, House of Ministries, the Ministry of Defense, the MFA, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, JSC "NC" KazMunayGas "JSC" NC "Kazakhstan Temir Joly," The State Archive of the RK, the National Library of RK, as well as residential complexes, office buildings, shopping and entertainment center "Keruen."--&gt;

'''Pichação''',&lt;ref&gt;Aulete Dictionary: [http://www.aulete.com.br/pichação pichação]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priberam Dictionary: [http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/pichação pichação]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes misspelled&lt;ref&gt;UOL Educação: [http://educacao.uol.com.br/dicas-portugues/ult2781u1080.jhtm "Pichador" derives from "piche"] {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dúvidas de português: [http://duvidas.dicio.com.br/piche-ou-pixe/ Piche or pixe] {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''pixação''' ({{IPA-pt|piʃaˈsɐ̃w̃}}), is the name given to [[graffiti]] in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern]] metropolises of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], in Brazil. It consists of [[Graffiti|tagging]] done in a distinctive, cryptic style, mainly on walls and vacant buildings. Many ''pichadores'' (''pichação'' painters) compete to paint in high and inaccessible places, using such techniques as [[free climbing]] and [[abseiling]] to reach the locations. Pichação is mostly condemned both by the society and the government since it is a crime. However, there is a difference between pichação and graffiti in Brazil, with graffiti being considered a form of art (as long as the property's owner agrees to have the wall graffited), and pichação not, often including rude and sexual themes.

==History==

''Pichação'', known also as "wall writings", began in the 1940s and 50s as political statements written in tar and "were often written in response to the slogans painted by political parties across the streets."&lt;ref name=manco&gt;Manco, Tristan, Lost Art, and Caleb Neelon; "Graffiti Brasil", Thames &amp; Hudson, London, 2005 ({{ISBN|0-500-28574-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; "Piche" is the Portuguese word for [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] or tar, and ''pichação'' originally meant writing in pitch. In the 1970s, ''pichação'' almost disappeared, but it was revived in the 1980s by a group of youths who began writing their names, and the names of their crews, instead of political slogans.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

''Pichação'' has been described as a "vehicle for the youth of the city to assert their existence and self-worth, and to do it loudly.  As a social protest, Pichação is brutal, effective and pulls no punches.  There is no country on earth with a worse distribution of wealth than Brazil.  For the rich, there are nice buildings.  For the poor, there are shanty towns.  Pichação exists on the very surface of the contested wealth, and promises to keep on punishing the fortunate until they produce a world less punishing to begin with."&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

==Methods==

Although its name is derived from the word for tar, many of the "pichadores" (those who do ''pichação'') in São Paulo use a 2-3 inch foam roller, spray paint and latex paint; it is what is known in English-speaking countries by the Italian word "graffiti". In other cities, such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], ''pichadores'' use only spray paint. Many ''pichadores'' write their crew name, while others write their own individual name. The letters are usually of equal height and spacing, although technique varies in different cities around Brazil. Although the lettering originally reflected the typography of eighties heavy metal record covers, the styles have evolved over time.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

''Pichadores'' often compete to tag the tallest, most dangerous, and most noteworthy locations.  One example of this is the group Os Diferentes, who tagged the internationally-known [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] statue in Rio de Janeiro. They were caught and arrested, but bragged about it the next day.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

'''''Pillar of Shame''''' is a series of sculptures by [[Denmark|Danish]] artist [[Jens Galschiot]]. Each sculpture is an 8-metre tall statue of [[bronze]], [[copper]] or [[concrete]]. The sculpture was inaugurated at the NGO Forum of the [[FAO]] summit in [[Rome]] in 1996. Since then three other pillars have been erected, in [[Hong Kong]], [[Mexico]], and [[Brazil]]. A fourth one in [[Berlin]] was planned for completion in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/art_and_events/pos/berlin/ukposberlindok.htm The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Berlin]. Aidoh.dk. Retrieved on 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan has not come to fruition due to various issues.&lt;ref name="aidoh.dk"&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/?categoryID=60 The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Berlin - a Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Terror]. Aidoh.dk. Retrieved on 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
According to Galschiot,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/art_and_events/pos/ukposdok.htm ''The Pillar of Shame'' — detailed description of the art happening that is being carried out by Jens Galschiot], Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; the sculptures remind people of a shameful event which must never recur. The torn and twisted bodies of the sculpture symbolize the degradation, devaluation and lack of respect for the individual. The black colour symbolizes grief and loss and the sculpture, which represents the victims, expresses the pain and the despair of the event. It can be used by both sides in complicated conflict situations, where it can be difficult to point out the guilty party.

== ''Pillar of Shame'' in Hong Kong ==
[[Image:HKU Pillar of Shame in Orange Color 02a.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Haking Wong Podium of the [[University of Hong Kong]], 2008. The [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] painted the sculpture orange in support of [[The Color Orange]] project.
]]
The ''Pillar of Shame'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|國殤之柱}}) in Hong Kong is a concrete sculpture, first erected in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] in 1997 to mark the eighth anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square massacre|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The statue depicts 50 torn and twisted bodies to symbolize those who died in the government crackdown. On the base of the statue, the history and pictures of the [[massacre]] are carved in  and engraved into the base, in both English and Chinese, are the words "The Tiananmen Massacre", "June&amp;nbsp;4th 1989" and "The old cannot kill the young forever."

The ''Pillar'' was first exhibited at the Candlelight Vigil in commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] on 3 June 1997. Following the vigil on the night of 4 June 1997, local university students fought for a place to permanently home the statue.  After scuffles with the police and controversy with the university leadership, at 3 a.m. students succeeded in moving the 2-tonne statue onto the podium of the Haking Wong Building at the [[University of Hong Kong]], however the pieces were not assembled due to concerns that the floor was not strong enough. The ''Pillar'' was re-erected at the same place on 16 June 1997.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During the following months, the ''Pillar'' was exhibited at the following universities:
*[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] from 28 September 1997
*[[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan College]] from 2 November 1997
*[[Hong Kong Baptist University]] from 29 November 1997
*[[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] from 23 January 1998
*[[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] from 1 March 1998
*[[City University of Hong Kong]] from 29 March 1998.

On 31 May 1998, the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, the sculpture was returned to Victoria Park where a candlelit vigil was held. On the morning before the vigil, a self-professed artist splashed two buckets of red paint onto the ''Pillar'', claiming that "the blood of people is also my blood."&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Prisca &amp; Luk, Mandy (5 June 1999). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=30141&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990605&amp;sear_year=1999 Artist adds `personal touch' to Pillar], ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 and 25 September 1998, [[The Hong Kong University Students' Union]] (HKUSU) held a general polling on a motion to home the ''Pillar of Shame'' at the University of Hong Kong on a long-term basis. The students' motion was carried, when 1,629 out of 2,190 voted to support,&lt;ref name=erect&gt;Lam Wan Rhonda (17 May 1999). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=28881&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990517&amp;sear_year=1999 "Students to erect ''Pillar of Shame'' permanently"], ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Pillar'' was moved onto the Haking Wong Podium again on 3 December 1998. It was again exhibited at the 10th anniversary candlelit vigil of the Massacre in 1999 at Victoria Park.&lt;ref name=without&gt;Wong, Samantha (3 June 1999). "''Pillar of Shame'' still without a home" ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;  Without the University authorities' endorsement, the ''Pillar'' was moved back to the Haking Wong podium after the anniversary,&lt;ref name=without/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff reporter and agencies (6 June 1999) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=30205&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990606&amp;sear_year=1999 "Campus war of words over pillar"], ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; where has remained on display at; a silent tribute is held by HKUSU and [[The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] in May every year.

On 30 April 2008, the ''Pillar of Shame'' was painted orange as part of the project [[The Color Orange]], to raise awareness about [[human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights in China]]. As the sculptor Galschiot was denied access to Hong Kong, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] painted the ''Pillar'' without his participation.

==Other ''Pillars of Shame'' ==
Other ''Pillars'' have been erected in the following locations:

[[File:Medailleverso.jpg|thumb|right|Prize medal received by [[Constant Montald]] in 1886]]
The Belgian '''Prix de Rome''' ({{lang-nl|Prijs van Rome}}) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French [[Prix de Rome]]. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the '''Grand Prix de Rome'''. There were distinct categories for painting, sculpture, architecture and music. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
The Prix de Rome was a [[scholarship]] for arts students. It was created in 1663 in [[France]] under the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual burse for promising artists (painters, sculptors, and architects) who proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] (''Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture''), was open to their students. The award winner would win a stay at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in [[Rome]] at the expense of the King of France. The stay could be extended if the director of the institution deemed it desirable.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as three categories &amp;mdash; [[painting]], [[sculpting]], and [[architecture]]; in 1803, [[music]] was added; in 1804, [[engraving]] was added. The winner of the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms. Michael Clarke. Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to [[French Academy in Rome|The Academy of France in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1666. In 1807, [[Louis Napoleon]] created the [[Prix de Rome (Netherlands)|Dutch version]] of the Prix de Rome. After the creation of Belgium as an independent state in 1830, the Belgian government started their own version of the Prix de Rome in 1832. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''''RMB City'''''  is a [[Virtual reality|virtual]] [[city]] in the online world of Second Life, planned and developed by Beijing artist [[Cao Fei]] (SL: China Tracy). Launched in 2008, and open to the public since January 2009, RMB City is a platform for experimental creative activities, one in which Cao Fei and her collaborators use different mediums to test the boundaries between virtual and physical existence. As a laboratory for investigations in art, design, architecture, literature, cinema, politics, economy, society, and beyond, RMB City is constantly nourished by new and innovative projects, and supported by leading international art institutions and networks. As a model of avant-garde urban planning, it traverses the boundaries between past and future, real and virtual to link China and the cosmopolitan contemporary world.

In 2009, RMB City was a lab for both filmmaking and live theater. Cao Fei's first documentary film after building RMB City, ''The Birth of RMB City'', took a dreamy and epic look at the city, showing how it was constructed, but also highlighting it's fragility by depicting an inevitable demise. After this film was completed, she invited different artists to use various mediums to create different live artworks, and those works also became the life of the on-line city. Based on those creative actions, Cao Fei made two films in the video format: ''People's Limbo'' and ''Live in RMB City'', both of which became chronicles of human experience in RMB City.

Cao Fei does not only investigate in virtual space however, and in 2009, she traversed boundaries to bring RMB City to the real life space by creating RMB City Opera. This stage performance brought the interaction and tension between real and virtual identities to light in front of an audience, by using both physical and Second Life spaces to set the stage for interaction between actors and avatars.

The running of RMB City is extensively documented on its [http://www.rmbcity.com official website].

== RMB City in RL (Real-life) ==

Throughout the "construction process" and actual operation period of RMB City in 2008, the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London displayed its progress in a dedicated physical space. Since then, RMB City has been exhibited in museums, galleries, and institutions around the world.

Virtual institution- and individual collector-"managed" buildings inside RMB City will hold regularly changing exhibitions and events open to all Second Life users.

*May 31, 2010 '''"RMB City Code, Season 1: Wangguowei Wasp" - Prize Ceremony'''
1 am Second Life Time, People's Park (RMB City 3 102, 11, 22)

Have you disentangled the RMB City Code? Or are you still wondering where Wangguowei Wasp is?
Whether you’re desperate for answers, or simply want to collect your free gift, join us for a special Prize Ceremony on May 31 at 1 am SLT, in People's Park.  Rumor has it that the elusive Wangguowei himself may drop in........

*March 29, 2010, '''"RMB City Code, Season 1: WangGuowei Wasp"''', a Second Life game:

In 1927, the poet Wang Guowei threw himself into the murmuring waters of Beijing's Kunming Lake, never to be seen again in the first world.

Now, almost a century later, a rumor is afoot: was that Wang Guo Wei's avatar that was recently spotted in Second Life? Yes, "Wangguowei Wasp" was seen in RMB City, only to swiftly vanish once again, leaving a trail of clues in his wake.

Beginning on March 29, 2010, and for one month thereafter, you can become a Second Life detective and help to solve the mystery of his latest disappearance.
This compelling mission will involve exploring the most secluded back alleys of the island and interacting with the most mysterious characters in all of RMB City. A curious eye and open-minded heart will help you to unearth Wuang Guowei's secret. 
At the end of the game, the most intrepid explorers will be awarded with an unexpected prize.

If your mission has not been completed yet, you may find some answers here...Listen carefully: the City is showing you the right path..

# RMB City REWARD. Come to RMB City, to look for a missing poet. His name is Wangguowei Wasp. They say it's the famous poet, Wang Guo Wei, reborn as a Second Life avatar. You may vaguely remember that you have read this poet's work, that some of the phrases in his poetry could make your heart jump. Because you want to take the responsibility to find this missing life, you have decided to accept this mission. To search for him, please continue in RMB City to find the clues.
# RMB City REWARD: All of the little hotels have grand names. The China Hotel is no exception.
# RMB City REWARD: When the hotel owner looks at you with naïve and innocent eyes, you will know that you have found the right place. Usually, in these types of places in the city – a place that people might see in the daylight as decrepit or filthy – usually is a very valuable clue. According to our friend M, the missing poet lived for a long time in these slums.
# JEROME: I have never met him, but there is good wine here, so maybe he has drunk here.
# RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you have gotten the right code. Please continue to search in RMB City for the next clue. We heard Master Q is an eager helper and very trustworthy, she lives nearby. It is not strange that in Chinese folklore, the Feng Shui Master always appears on the horizon in desperate times.
# Master Q: My eyes change from red to blue; my eyes are fire. Water and fire harmonize each other, and in the Second Life, I can see that all sectors of life become broken pieces when passed down generation by generation. These vague and unclear matters repeat themselves; they spread in RMB City like toys, or as if they are lining up to wait for the magical gates to open.
# RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you have cracked the code accurately. Please continue in RMB City to look for the next clue. Master Q has indirectly shown you the way, the direction of the water. Go to the abundant water network of RMB City to look for it, if you’re lucky, you will find the "Yu Gong".
# RMB City REWARD: Congratulations, you have cracked the code accurately. Please continue in RMB City to look for the next clue. This painting scroll is "Gazing at the Mountain on the Riverbank", by Ni Zan, 1363. It depicts Ni Zan's feelings as he says goodbye to his friends, taking his boat onto the river and gazing back at the mountain. The saying goes, that in the most difficult times, Ni Zan decided to sell everything he had, take the boat, and sail out onto Tai Lake, initiating his floating hermit life. Being a hermit was Wang Guo Wei's dream in the first life, could it also be that he's become a hermit in RMB City?
# RMB City Reward: Sorry, your search took a wrong turn. Time in RMB City is ‘condensed’, therefore you have to grab at the cracks in time, so that you may encounter people from different lifetimes. All of these people have a possible connection to the poet.
# RMB YuGong – Congratulations, you have found the LANDMARK, continue to follow the stream to look for the next clue.
# China Tracy: Sorry, I can’t tell you more, because this Second Life has no memory. This city continues to stretch, there is no end. Everything flows far, far away....
# RMB Depression Bottle: No water here, only the image of the water.
# RMB Happy Bottle: RMB City is created with transparency and imagination. It is very possible it doesn’t exist, and even though it exists now, it might not exist in the future. It ends after our visit ends, it starts again upon our return. Repeatedly it goes in and out of life, in the end, we all share the whole world.
# RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you’ve gained the "People’s Card of Health". Please continue to look for the next clue, as the massage beauty has left a word for you: In this city, people come and go, and it's hard to find the ideal husband!
# RMB City: Perhapa WangguoweiWasp comes to this ‘pleasure parlor’ just to feel the sadness of happiness in a swift exchange.
# RMB City Reward: This poem, titled "Water Dragon Song", was composed in Wang Guo Wei's first life, around 1907.
# RMB City REWARD: To compose poetry on the wall is a form of expression that Chinese literati will never tire of.
# RMB City REWARD: In this poem, on one hand, the poetry's emphasis is on the "imagery of the water", the misty rain on the pond, spring stream and the tears of the departing people. On the other hand, in this phrase, he also hinted at the "earth" and its relationship with water, (alike they drift, but its preferable to be stable earth, rather than to be loose, flowing, moving water) – starting with the body of water, extending to its opposition to the earth, all while hinting that we will ultimately turn toward dust.
# RMB City REWARD: Sorry, your mission has misidentified the matter, please continue to search in RMB City.
# RMB City REWARD: Sorry, you have misidentified the matter, There is a poem that will give you direction.
# RMB City REWARD: Congratulations, you have received LM, this city is full of the life of Avatars, because people gather air gradually, then maybe as this city gradually gathers more temperature, it will have more of a human atmosphere.
# RMB City REWARD: Is it that the poet sits by the only dining table, facing the empty chair and the beautiful dishes, but with no one to toast?
# Marx: I found real happiness in Second Life, the realization of the happiness of personal value and labor. I always believe: the New World will be reborn constantly, just as the Old WOrld will die constantly.
# Red Detachment of Women: In my Second Life, I find my most worship-worthy revolutionary companion.
# Marx: I’m sorry, your mission has misidentified the matter. For instance, if I say that Wang Guo Wei's first life was in the era of revolution, and suicide was his inevitable destiny, then the confused poet Wangguowei Wasp is exactly the sort of "post-revolution anxiety" of this romantic city.
# Marx: The whole city is filled with those extraordinary "post-revolution anxieties" – it is an indescribable contemporary daily atmosphere – where have the revolutionary heroes gone?
# RMB Psalm: Sorry, your mission has misidentified the matter. In Second Life, the revolutionaries still long for revolution, the depressed people are still sunk in despair. The memorial still exists, but the ghost of the memory has died.
# RMB Psalm: In these young ruins, are there undying lovers in the broken airplane, flying the red flag, rusting public squares, broken streets, singing his poems? If you bring those poems amongst the mountains, water, grass, and trees, maybe you will find the spirit of the poet.
# RMB City Reward: Congratulations you have found Wang Guo Wei ‘s Hat, please wait for the date of award ceremony. In Second Life, life and death blur together, we have the opportunity to experience everything.
# RMB City REWARD: Congratulations you have found Wang Guo Wei’s calligraphy brush. Please wait for the date of the awards ceremony. Whether it is in the first or second life, we hope to find a stable life and an established destiny.
# RMB City REWARD: Congratulations, you have found the ghost spirit of Wang Guowei Wasp, please wait for the date of the award ceremony. The low singing of the poet floats through the ears: "Standing by the rail, mountain and river do not end, it is easy to depart, but harder to reunite. Running water, dropping flower petals, spring has gone, heaven is on earth.

    Blossom without shows to other,
    then how would wither after rain.
    Long peaceful calm day,
    stood a slight while in the corridor,
    rise blurred lingering affection.
    Gentle rain falls into the pool,
    setting sun shining on the compound,
    with heavily door shuttered.
    All about to stop, where the cloth slide over,
    just there, all for the wind.
    Story of flowers are waning to you,
    even more unnecessary to pursue,
    all branches all been covered by whitish snow.
    Mention about people only for harmonious,
    sadness and happiness in the world are all fall into pieces.
    As to fly away,
    rather to gather into dust, not flow away by the river.
    With fear of such limpid warmly Spring River,
    are stored the tears from whom already leave.

The '''Royal Society of Marine Artists''' ('''RSMA''') is an association of artists in [[London]], England, that promotes contemporary [[marine art]]. This includes painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture.&lt;ref name=mall&gt;[http://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/fba.html "The Royal Society of Marine Artists"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211222127/http://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/fba.html |date=11 February 2007 }}, The Federation of British Artists. Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
The Royal Society of Marine Artists was founded in 1939. This came about after some initial exhibitions on the subject, staged "largely due to the anomaly that Great Britain, whose history is so bound up with the sea, did not have a society dedicated to painting the sea and its occasions."&lt;ref name=mall/&gt; One of these early exhibitions, ''Sea Power'', gained the patronage of King [[George VI]] and was opened by [[Winston Churchill]].  Subsequently, in 1938, [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]], the [[Earl of Cork|Earl of Cork and Orrey]] suggested the formation of a formal society, which came into being with the title "The Society of Marine Artists".&lt;ref name=mall/&gt; 

No activity took place immediately because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], and it was not until 1946 that the Society's inaugural exhibition was mounted in the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] at the invitation of the [[City of London Corporation]]. This became the venue for the Society's  annual exhibitions. In 1966, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] granted assent for the title of "The Royal Society of Marine Artists". The location for the annual exhibitions was changed to the Mall Galleries in 1981, when building works prevented use of the Guildhall.&lt;ref name=mall/&gt; 

The Society maintains links with other relevant organisations, including the [[National Maritime Museum]], the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] and with publishers and the shipping industry.&lt;ref name=nmm&gt; [http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/nav.005001005000005 "The Royal Society of Marine Artists"], [[National Maritime Museum]], UK. Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Blandford published a 176-page book ''A Celebration of Marine Art : Fifty Years of the Royal Society of Marines Artists''.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0713725648/ "A Celebration of Marine Art : Fifty Years of the Royal Society of Marines Artists"] Amazon.com. Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Society exhibited work at the National Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=nmm/&gt; 

[[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] (1878–1971) was a member, as was [[Harry Heine]] (1928–2004) the first [[Canada|Canadian]] to be elected. [[Leslie Arthur Wilcox]] (1904-1982) was Honorary Secretary from 1960-1974.

The society is a registered charity. It is also one of the nine member societies that form the [[Federation of British Artists]], which is based in and administers the Mall Galleries, next to [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref name=mall/&gt; Approximately 50 full members are entitled to use the letters R.S.M.A. after their name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Rudolf Baranik''' (1920&amp;ndash;1998) was an artist, educator and writer.

Born in [[Lithuania]], he [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the United States]] in 1938. He was well known in the art world for his political advocacy,&lt;ref&gt;"The New York Times," by Roberta Smith, March 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first artists to organize protests against the war in Vietnam.  Some of his best known works are the ''Napalm Elegies,'' a series of 30 antiwar paintings created between 1967 and 1974. His art was inspired by his sense of the gross inequities around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hess in Forward to ''Poetics and Politics in the Art of Rudolf Baranik,'' New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and he led virtually every progressive political movement within the New York art world from the 1960s to the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of New Mexico, Museum of Fine Arts, "Idea Photographic:  After Modernism," Artists, Rudolf Baranik, by Virginia Lee Lierz&lt;/ref&gt;
Significant exhibitions and awards include:[[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1981|1981 Guggenheim Fellowship in Fine Arts]], [[May Stevens|1982 "Art Couples 1: May Stevens and Rudolf Baranik," P.S. 1, New York, NY]], and [[Peace Tower (art)|1966 Peace Tower]]. Baranik's art is included in many collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Hirshhorn Museum]].

Baranik died in [[Eldorado at Santa Fe, New Mexico|Eldorado, New Mexico]] in 1998.

The paintings of Rudolf Baranik are increasingly thought to be among the most important works of the New York School painting of the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;David Craven, Poetics and Politics in the Art of Rudolf Baranik, New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; with the late paintings in particular considered by American art critic, [[Donald Kuspit]], "the true climax of fifty years of Western abstract painting."&lt;ref&gt;"Rudolf Baranik:  An Overview," by Donald Kuspit, a paper presented on the occasion of the memorial retrospective exhibition of Rudolf Baranik's art at the [[University of Arizona Museum of Art]], November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">'''Sarajevo International Culture Exchange''' (short:'''SICE''') was an international art project annually taking place between 2003 and 2007 in [[Sarajevo]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
SICE was held under the patronage of the German and Japanese embassy in Sarajevo. It was one of the biggest international art events in Sarajevo after the Balkan War.

==Common==
SICE emerged from a planned cooperation between the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] and the faculty of fine arts at the University of Sarajevo. The Japanese artist [http://www.sohei-iwata.com Sohei Iwata] started the project in 2003 with the help of Sanna Miericke, Willem Besselink, Tino Mager, Damir Kulo, Elodie Evers and Masaru Iwai. A few dozen artists from all over the world were invited to deal with Sarajevo in situ. The place was chosen due to its special conditions after the Balkan War.
The participants initiated workshops, film screenings, discussions and exhibitions independently from existing museums and galleries.

==Themes==
*2003 - The first years theme was "Field-Projects".
*2004 - "The Sarajevo Living Room" revitalised a destroyed factory and turned it into an art gallery.
*2005 - "Re_Cultivation" took place at Skenderija, Empty House, Barake.
*2006 - "Transition Compound" took place at Tokyo, Berlin,Sarajevo.
*2007 - "Mo Bar"took place at Stage of Modern Art Museum of Sarajevo.

==Publications==
Every year's project was documented in a catalogue.
*2005 Tokyo/JAP, '[https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4845905787 Social Arts (Japanese)]' Practica published by Film Arts.

'''Saul Aaron Kripke''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l|_|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|p|k|i}}; born November 13, 1940) is an [[American philosopher]] and [[logician]]. He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]] and emeritus professor at [[Princeton University]]. Since the 1960s, Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[set theory]]. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 [[Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy.

Kripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially [[modal logic]]. His work has profoundly influenced [[analytic philosophy]]; his principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving [[possible world]]s, now called [[Kripke semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Fodor, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/jerry-fodor/waters-water-everywhere Water's water everywhere]", ''London Review of Books'', 21 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a "metaphysical" notion that should be separated from the epistemic notion of ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and that there are [[Logical truth|necessary truths]] that are ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' truths, such as that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. He has also contributed an original reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], referred to as "[[Kripkenstein]]." A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form 1980 as ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.

==Life and career==
Saul Kripke is the oldest of three children born to [[Dorothy K. Kripke]] and Rabbi [[Myer S. Kripke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kripke|first=Saul|title=Philosophical Troubles: Collected Papers Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-973015-5|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the leader of Beth El Synagogue, the only Conservative congregation in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]; his mother wrote educational Jewish books for children. Saul and his two sisters, Madeline and Netta, attended Dundee Grade School and [[Omaha Central High School]]. Kripke was labeled a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], teaching himself [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] by the age of six, reading Shakespeare's complete works by nine, and mastering the works of Descartes and complex mathematical problems before finishing elementary school.&lt;ref name="Charles McGrath"&gt;{{cite news

Saul Kripke (1940–)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first completeness theorem in [[modal logic]] at 17, and had it published a year later. After graduating from high school in 1958, Kripke attended [[Harvard University]] and graduated [[summa cum laude]] in 1962 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics. During his sophomore year at Harvard, he taught a graduate-level logic course at nearby [[MIT]]. Upon graduation he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]], and in 1963 was appointed to the [[Society of Fellows]]. Kripke later said, "I wish I could have skipped college. I got to know some interesting people but I can't say I learned anything. I probably would have learned it all anyway just reading on my own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/books/philosopher-65-lectures-not-about-what-am-i-but-what-is-i.html|title=Philosopher, 65, Lectures Not About 'What Am I?' but 'What Is I?'|first=Charles|last=McGrath|date=January 28, 2006|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After briefly teaching at Harvard, in 1968 Kripke moved to [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City, where he taught until 1976. In 1978 he took a chaired professorship at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saul-Kripke|title=Saul Kripke - American logician and philosopher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he received the university's Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities. In 2002 Kripke began teaching at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]], and in 2003 he was appointed a distinguished professor of philosophy there.

Kripke has received honorary degrees from the [[University of Nebraska]], Omaha (1977), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1997), [[University of Haifa]], Israel (1998), and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (2005). He is a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and an elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and in 1985 was a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britac.ac.uk/user/3271{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Schock Prize]] in Logic and Philosophy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/en-GB/priset/tidigarepristagare.10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke was married to philosopher [[Margaret Gilbert]]. He is the second cousin once removed of television writer, director, and producer [[Eric Kripke]].

==Work==
[[File:LTL model.png|thumb|185px|right|Example Kripke model for [[linear temporal logic]], a particular modal logic]]
Kripke's contributions to philosophy include:

# [[Kripke semantics]] for [[modal logic|modal and related logics]], published in several essays beginning in his teens.
# His 1970 Princeton lectures ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' (published in 1972 and 1980), which significantly restructured [[philosophy of language]].
# His interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]].
# His theory of [[truth]].

He has also contributed to set theory (see [[admissible ordinal]] and [[Kripke–Platek set theory]]).

===Modal logic===
Two of Kripke's earlier works, ''A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic'' and ''Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic,'' the former written when he was a teenager, were on [[modal logic]]. The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke. Kripke introduced the now-standard [[Kripke semantics]] (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to [[intuitionistic logic]] and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent before Kripke.

A '''Kripke frame''' or '''modal frame''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is a non-empty set, and ''R'' is a [[binary relation]] on ''W''. Elements of ''W'' are called ''nodes'' or ''worlds'', and ''R'' is known as the [[accessibility relation]].  Depending on the properties of the accessibility relation ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]], reflexivity, etc.), the corresponding frame is described, by extension, as being transitive, reflexive, etc.

A '''Kripke model''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a Kripke frame, and [[Turnstile (symbol)|&lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;]] is a relation between nodes of ''W'' and modal formulas, such that:

* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\neg A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\nVdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\,(w\; R\; u&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A)&lt;/math&gt;.

We read &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; as "''w'' satisfies ''A''", "''A'' is satisfied in ''w''", or "''w'' forces ''A''". The relation &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''satisfaction relation'', ''evaluation'', or ''[[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] relation''. The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its value on propositional variables.

A formula ''A'' is '''valid''' in:

* a model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; for all ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'',
* a frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if it is valid in &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all possible choices of &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;,
* a class ''C'' of frames or models, if it is valid in every member of ''C''.

We define Thm(''C'') to be the set of all formulas that are valid in ''C''. Conversely, if ''X'' is a set of formulas, let Mod(''X'') be the class of all frames which validate every formula from ''X''.

A modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) ''L'' is '''sound''' with respect to a class of frames ''C'', if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C''). ''L'' is '''complete''' with respect to ''C'' if ''L''&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;Thm(''C'').

Semantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e., a derivation system) only if the semantical [[entailment]] relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the ''consequence'' relation (''derivability''). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and for them, to determine which class it is.

For any class ''C'' of Kripke frames, Thm(''C'') is a [[normal modal logic]] (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, ''K'', are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold generally. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is unproblematic, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions.

A normal modal logic ''L'' '''corresponds''' to a class of frames ''C'', if ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Mod(''L''). In other words, ''C'' is the largest class of frames such that ''L'' is sound wrt ''C''. It follows that ''L'' is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.

Consider the schema '''T''' : &lt;math&gt;\Box A\to A&lt;/math&gt;. '''T''' is valid in any [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; since ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w''. On the other hand, a frame which validates '''T''' has to be reflexive: fix ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and define satisfaction of a propositional variable ''p'' as follows: &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''u''. Then &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash \Box p&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; by '''T''', which means ''w''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''w'' using the definition of &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;. '''T''' corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames.

It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of ''L'' than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show ''incompleteness'' of modal logics: suppose ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not prove all theorems of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema &lt;math&gt;\Box(A\equiv\Box A)\to\Box A&lt;/math&gt; generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as '''GL''' (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the '''GL'''-[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] &lt;math&gt;\Box
A\to\Box\Box A&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Canonical models ====

For any normal modal logic ''L'', a Kripke model (called the '''canonical model''') can be constructed, which validates precisely the theorems of ''L'', by an adaptation of the standard technique of using [[maximal consistent set]]s as models. Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]] construction in algebraic semantics.

A set of formulas is ''L''-''consistent'' if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of ''L'', and [[modus ponens]]. A ''maximal L-consistent set'' (an ''L''-''MCS'' for short) is an ''L''-consistent set which has no proper ''L''-consistent superset.

The '''canonical model''' of ''L'' is a Kripke model &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' is the set of all ''L''-''MCS'', and the relations ''R'' and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; are as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;X\;R\;Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\Box A\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A\in Y&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;X\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

The canonical model is a model of ''L'', as every ''L''-''MCS'' contains all theorems of ''L''. By [[Zorn's lemma]], each ''L''-consistent set is contained in an ''L''-''MCS'', in particular every formula unprovable in ''L'' has a counterexample in the canonical model.

The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of '''K''' immediately imply completeness of '''K''' with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does ''not'' work for arbitrary ''L'', because there is no guarantee that the underlying ''frame'' of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of ''L''.

We say that a formula or a set ''X'' of formulas is '''canonical''' with respect to a property ''P'' of Kripke frames, if

* ''X'' is valid in every frame which satisfies ''P'',
* for any normal modal logic ''L'' which contains ''X'', the underlying frame of the canonical model of ''L'' satisfies ''P''.

A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and [[compactness theorem|compact]].

The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic '''S4.1''' (in fact, even '''K4.1''') is canonical.

In general, it is [[decision problem|undecidable]] whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called [[Sahlqvist formula]]s) such that:

* a Sahlqvist formula is canonical,
* the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is [[first-order logic|first-order]] definable,
* there is an algorithm which computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula.

This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. A logic has the [[finite model property]] (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the decidability question: it follows from Post's theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic L which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of L. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.

There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as filtration or unravelling. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly.

Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.

In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete wrt a class of modal algebras, and a finite modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke complete.

Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with
&lt;math&gt;\{\Box_i\mid\,i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set ''W'' equipped with binary relations ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''. The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\,(w\;R_i\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

==== Carlson models ====

A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal [[provability logic]]s. A '''Carlson model''' is a structure &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R,\{D_i\}_{i\in I},\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with a single accessibility relation ''R'', and subsets ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''W'' for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\Box_i A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall u\in D_i\,(w\;R\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).&lt;/math&gt;

Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete.

In ''Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic'', published in 1963, Kripke responded to a difficulty with classical [[quantification theory]]. The motivation for the world-relative approach was to represent the possibility that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rules are used, however, every term must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that exist contingently.

Kripke's response to this difficulty was to eliminate terms. He gave an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened.

Kripke's possible worlds theory has been used by narratologists (beginning with Pavel and Dolezel) to understand "reader's manipulation of alternative plot developments, or the characters' planned or fantasized alternative action series." This application has become especially useful in the analysis of [[hyperfiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Fludernik, Monika. "Histories of Narrative Theory: From Structuralism to Present." ''A Companion to Narrative Theory.'' Ed. Phelan and Rabinowitz. Blackwell Publishing, MA:2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitionistic logic===
Kripke semantics for [[intuitionistic logic]] follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but uses a different definition of satisfaction.

An '''intuitionistic Kripke model''' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] Kripke frame, and &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following conditions:
* if ''p'' is a propositional variable, &lt;math&gt;w\le u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash p&lt;/math&gt; (''persistency'' condition),
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\land B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\lor B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A\to B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has the Finite Model Property.

'''Intuitionistic first-order logic'''

Let ''L'' be a [[first-order logic|first-order]] language. A Kripke model of ''L'' is a triple
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le,\{M_w\}_{w\in W}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\langle W,\le\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a
(classical) ''L''-structure for each node ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W'', and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever ''u''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''v'':
* the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is included in the domain of ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* realizations of function symbols in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' agree on elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* for each ''n''-ary predicate ''P'' and elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'': if ''P''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', then it holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Given an evaluation ''e'' of variables by elements of ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', we define the satisfaction relation &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash P(t_1,\dots,t_n)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;P(t_1[e],\dots,t_n[e])&lt;/math&gt; holds in ''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\land B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\lor B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(A\to B)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e]&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash B[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* not &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash\bot[e]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\exists x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists an &lt;math&gt;a\in M_w&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;w\Vdash(\forall x\,A)[e]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;u\ge w&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;a\in M_u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''e''(''x''→''a'') is the evaluation which gives ''x'' the value ''a'', and otherwise agrees with ''e''.

===''Naming and Necessity''===

{{main|Naming and Necessity}}
[[File:Naming and Necessity.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' ]]
The three lectures that form ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' constitute an attack on [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[John Searle]], among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] implausible as a theory of how names get their references determined (e.g., surely [[Aristotle]] could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, but it would seem wrong to deny that he was still Aristotle).

As an alternative, Kripke outlined a [[Causal theory of names|causal theory of reference]], according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are [[rigid designation|rigid designators]]: that is, a proper name refers to the named object in every [[possible worlds|possible world]] in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, "Richard Nixon" refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while "the person who won the [[United States presidential election, 1968|United States presidential election of 1968"]] could refer to [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.

Kripke also raised the prospect of ''[[A Posteriori Necessity|a posteriori necessities]]'' — facts that are [[necessarily true]], though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include "[[Hesperus]] is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]", "[[Cicero]] is [[Cicero|Tully]]", "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object.

Finally, Kripke gave an argument against [[physicalism|identity materialism]] in the [[philosophy of mind]], the view that every mental particular is identical with some physical particular. Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an ''a posteriori'' necessary identity, but that such an identity — e.g., that pain is [[C fiber|C-fibers]] firing — could not be necessary, given the (clearly conceivable) possibility that pain could be separate from the firing of C-fibers, or the firing of C-fibers be separate from pain. (Similar arguments have since been made by [[David Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. 1996. ''The Conscious Mind.'' [[Oxford University Press]] pp. 146–9.&lt;/ref&gt;) In any event, the psychophysical identity theorist, according to Kripke, incurs a dialectical obligation to explain the apparent logical possibility of these circumstances, since according to such theorists they should be impossible.

Kripke delivered the [[John Locke lectures]] in philosophy at [[Oxford]] in 1973. Titled ''Reference and Existence'', they are in many respects a continuation of ''Naming and Necessity'', and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They were recently published by Oxford University Press.

In a 1995 paper, philosopher [[Quentin Smith]] argued that key concepts in Kripke's new theory of reference originated in the work of [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] more than a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith |first=Quentin |date=2 August 2001 | title=Marcus, Kripke, and the Origin of the New Theory of Reference |journal=Synthese |volume= 104 |issue= 2 |pages=179–189 | url=http://www.qsmithwmu.com/marcus,_kripke,_and_the_origin_of_the_new_theory_of_reference.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20060507144448/http://www.qsmithwmu.com/marcus,_kripke,_and_the_origin_of_the_new_theory_of_reference.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-28 | doi=10.1007/BF01063869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith identified six significant ideas in the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) that proper names are direct references that do not consist of contained definitions; (2) that while one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent to a proper name of this thing; (3) the modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions; (4) a formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity; (5) the concept of a [[rigid designator]], though Kripke coined that term; and (6) ''a posteriori'' identity. Smith argued that Kripke failed to understand Marcus's theory at the time but later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.

Other scholars have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that no plagiarism occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/faculty/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714235537/http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/faculty/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2010 | author=[[Stephen Neale]] |title=No Plagiarism Here | journal=[[Times Literary Supplement]] | pages=12–13 | date = 9 February 2001 | accessdate = 2009-11-13 |format =.PDF |doi=10.1007/BF01063869 |volume=104 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burgess, "Marcus, Kripke, and Names" ''Philosophical Studies'', 84: 1, pp. 1–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="A Puzzle about Belief"====
Kripke's main propositions about proper names in ''Naming and Necessity'' are that the meaning of a name simply is the object it refers to and that a name's referent is determined by a causal link between some sort of "baptism" and the utterance of the name. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that propositions containing names may have some additional semantic properties,&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, 1980, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; properties that could explain why two names referring to the same person may give different [[truth value]]s in propositions about beliefs. For example, Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly, although she does not believe that Clark Kent can fly. This can be accounted for if the names "Superman" and "Clark Kent", though referring to the same person, have distinct semantic properties.

But in his article "A Puzzle about Belief" Kripke seems to oppose even this possibility. His argument can be reconstructed as follows: The idea that two names referring to the same object may have different semantic properties is supposed to explain that [[Coreference|coreferring]] names behave differently in propositions about beliefs (as in Lois Lane's case). But the same phenomenon occurs even with coreferring names that obviously have the same semantic properties: Kripke invites us to imagine a French, monolingual boy, Pierre, who believes that "''Londres est joli''" ("London is beautiful"). Pierre moves to London without realizing that London = Londres. He then learns English the same way a child would learn the language, that is, not by translating words from French to English. Pierre learns the name "London" from the unattractive part of the city where he lives, and so comes to believe that London is not beautiful. If Kripke's account is correct, Pierre now believes both that ''Londres'' is ''joli'' and that London is not beautiful. This cannot be explained by coreferring names having different semantic properties. According to Kripke, this demonstrates that attributing additional semantic properties to names does not explain what it is intended to.

===Wittgenstein===
{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}
First published in 1982, Kripke's ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date", and that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a "skeptical solution" to ameliorate the paradox's destructive effects.

Most commentators accept that ''Philosophical Investigations'' contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, but few have agreed with his attributing a skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. It should be noted that Kripke himself expresses doubts in ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'' as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of ''Philosophical Investigations.'' He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein's views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein's argument "as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him".

The portmanteau "Kripkenstein" has been coined for Kripke's interpretation of ''Philosophical Investigations''. Kripkenstein's main significance was a clear statement of a new kind of skepticism, dubbed "meaning skepticism": the idea that for an isolated individual there is no fact in virtue of which he/she means one thing rather than another by the use of a word. Kripke's "skeptical solution" to meaning skepticism is to ground meaning in the behavior of a community.

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]], and Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke's book "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.  Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations: An Introduction.  Cambridge University Press. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth===
In his 1975 article "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Kripke showed that a language can consistently contain its own [[truth]] predicate, something deemed impossible by [[Alfred Tarski]], a pioneer in formal theories of truth. The approach involves letting truth be a partially defined property over the set of grammatically well-formed sentences in the language. Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language that do not contain the truth predicate, and defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this action adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them. Unlike Tarski's approach, however, Kripke's lets "truth" be the union of all of these definition-stages; after a denumerable infinity of steps the language reaches a "fixed point" such that using Kripke's method to expand the truth-predicate does not change the language any further. Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate. But this predicate is undefined for any sentences that do not, so to speak, "bottom out" in simpler sentences not containing a truth predicate. That is, " 'Snow is white' is true" is well-defined, as is " ' "Snow is white" is true' is true," and so forth, but neither "This sentence is true" nor "This sentence is not true" receive truth-conditions; they are, in Kripke's terms, "ungrounded."
[[File:Saul Kripke's Gödel lecture at UCSB.jpg|thumb|227x227px|Saul Kripke gives a lecture about [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].]]
Nevertheless, it has been shown by [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects (such as integers) can have an informal self-referential meaning, and this idea – manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]] – is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined. It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's suggestion does lead to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. There is still a debate about whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every variation of such a partial truth system, but none has been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable proving methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

Kripke's proposal is also problematic in the sense that while the language contains a "truth" predicate of itself (at least a partial one), some of its sentences – such as the liar sentence ("this sentence is false") – have an undefined truth value, but the language does not contain its own "undefined" predicate. In fact it cannot, as that would create a new version of the [[liar paradox]], called the ''strengthened liar paradox'' ("this sentence is false or undefined"). Thus while the liar sentence is undefined in the language, the language cannot express that it is undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/self-reference/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Thomas|last=Bolander|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=30 May 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandinavia''' has a long and proud tradition of '''rug-making''' on par with many of the regions of the world that are perhaps more immediately associated with the craft—regions such as [[Chinese rug|China]] and [[Persian rug|Persia]]. Rugs have been handmade by craftspeople in the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden for centuries, and have often played important cultural roles in each of these countries. Contemporary Scandinavian rugs—most especially [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Swedish rugs]]—are among the most sought after rugs in the world today, largely due to the contributions of designers like Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom.&lt;ref name="mmf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmf.se/html_en/index2.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222013619/http://www.mmf.se/html_en/index2.htm |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |website=Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom AB|title=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Scandinavian rugs is a vital chapter in the cultural study of Scandinavia, as it reveals a great deal about the aesthetic and social conventions of that region.

== History ==
The history of [[rug-making]] in [[Scandinavia]] is complex. Indeed, the history of how artisanal rug-making became a cultural institution throughout Scandinavia is very much the history of how the craft spread throughout the whole of [[Europe]], from its origins as a traditional Eastern art form. Indeed, the rug-makers of Scandinavia – like many of their other European counterparts – were heavily influenced by the aesthetics as well as the manufacturing techniques of the rug-makers of [[Anatolia]] and [[Asia Minor]], with whom the Scandinavians of the [[Early Middle Ages]] had considerable contact via international trade routes. By the tenth century of the [[Common Era]], Scandinavians were trading extensively with the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Constantinople]], creating a considerable interest in fine rugs throughout Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Textiles: A Concise History (World of Art)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the right and twelfth centuries of the Common Era, a large preponderance of traditionally made Byzantine rugs were brought into Northern Europe – including into the Scandinavian Kingdoms of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Nazmiyal Swedish Rugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/vintage/swedish/ |title=Swedish Rugs &amp;#124; Vintage Swedish Kilims and Rug Collection |website=Nazmiyalantiquerugs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of those countries' harsh climate, which frequently counts among the coldest and bitterest winters anywhere on Earth, the expertly crafted rugs of the Byzantines fit right in: the best Byzantine rugs were often hung in stately homes for insulation purposes and were frequently used as blankets by Scandinavian noblemen.&lt;ref name="Scandinavian Rugs History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artiesa.com/origins/scandinavian-rugs/ |title=Scandinavian Rugs |website=Artiesa.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles" /&gt; For a long time, it was this arrangement that dominated in Scandinavia: Oriental rugs were brought in from the Eastern Empire into Scandinavia, with very few original pieces actually being woven in Scandinavia. However, after centuries of exposure to fine Oriental rugs, the people of Scandinavia began to develop their own distinct style of artisanal rug-making.

By the fourteenth century A.D., Scandinavians had developed the art of the [[Rya (rug)|Rya]] (or Ryijy).&lt;ref name="Nazmiyal: Swedish Rugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nazmiyalantiquerugs.com/vintage/swedish/ |title=Swedish Rugs &amp;#124; Vintage Swedish Kilims and Rug Collection |website=Nazmiyalantiquerugs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These distinctive rugs represented a new development in the art form that told the story of the artisans responsible for them: unlike the Oriental rugs of the Eastern Empire to which the Scandinavians had become accustomed, Ryas were made thick with shaggy, long pile: these rugs were specifically engineered to help the Scandinavian people weather their notoriously harsh winters. Soon after their development, Ryas were everywhere in [[Middle Ages]] Scandinavia, often replacing traditional Oriental rugs as well as cloaks and blankets. Splendid examples of this sort of tug have been found at archaeological excavations of old [[Viking]] settlements, most notably in [[York, England]].&lt;ref name="WorldTextiles" /&gt;

In addition to serving as wall coverings and blankets for noblemen and commoners alike, traditional Ryas were also used in marriage ceremonies throughout Scandinavia, throughout the Middle Ages. Ryas woven for such occasions are very distinct pieces, often featuring the initials of the bride and the groom, the date of the wedding ceremony, a set of double hearts, and symbols and signs that represented the groom’s and the bride’s families. Wedding Ryas were extremely important, and perhaps represent the most distinct development in Scandinavian rug-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SWEDISH TEXTILE ART: Traditional Marriage Weavings from Scania (The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Swedish Textile Art) |edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Even as the Scandinavian rug-making tradition matured from the 1500s through the 1800s, more traditionally Oriental themes were incorporated into the finest Scandinavian rugs, with the [[Tree of Life]] motif featuring most prominently. A standby in Persian rugs, the Tree of Life symbol was adapted by the rug-makers of Scandinavia to represent family trees and ties.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

By the 1880s, traditional Scandinavian rugs – and, most especially, Ryas – were hugely popular throughout [[northern Europe]]. In addition, Sweden had begun to produce a very distinctive style of rug, the Rollakan. These pieces were generally flat-woven rugs bedecked with elaborate tapestry art, making them very distinctive from the generally abstract, thick-piled Ryas – even as they were used for similar purposes.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

From humble beginnings, the craft of rug-making in Scandinavia has blossomed into a complex art form with various outlets for craftspeople to explore. And though Rya rugs fell out of favor with the nobles of Scandinavia and were subsequently relegated to the domain of [[folk art]],{{when|date=June 2016}}{{cn|date=June 2016}} there was a massive explosion in the popularity of the traditional Rya rug in the middle years of the twentieth century – a phenomenon that continues on today.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

Ryas had been made with abstract, geometric designs for centuries, and had always been made with thick shaggy pile. This design style was particularly appealing to the [[modernist]] designers of mid-twentieth-century Europe and [[North America]], who felt that shaggy, colorful carpets worked well to offset the harsher and colder design elements that dominated their own aesthetic: in a home with many straight lines, hard woods, and metals, the soft and colorful design style of Rya rugs gave a sense of warmth and color that often worked to create a homier house. Designers as influential as [[Ray Eames]], [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], were all known to enjoy the effect of a traditional Scandinavian rug.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

== Rug making techniques ==


The art of rug-making is ancient and extraordinarily complex – not to mention culturally significant to the peoples among whom such traditions developed. The complicated lists of knot-types and weaving techniques long employed by the master weavers of China and Persia are indicative of the importance of rug-making to those cultures. Though rug-making came to Scandinavia notably later than it did to traditional rug-making cultures in the Eastern world, an equally complex and sophisticated methodology for weaving fine rugs did develop in those northern European countries. {{cn|date=June 2016}} 

Rya rugs, for example, are woven with a combination of techniques that include weaving tapestry, needlework, and carpet knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal and Village Rugs: The Definitive Guide to Design, Pattern &amp; Motif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Scandinavian Rya rugs were hand-made by artisans who would add symmetric [[Turkish knot|Turkish (or Ghiordes) knots]] directly to the warp through a specially woven backing. Small holes in the weave allowed the rug-makers to insert evenly spaced knots using a larger tapestry needle.{{cn|date=June 2016}}  

Unlike many other culturally important rugs, Ryas were used with the pile facing downward, the better to insulate the wearer. As such, design elements and  ornamentation were woven into the back of the rugs, with the pile consisting of solid colors. Over time, this was reversed, creating the colorful Ryas that caught the eye of the mid-twentieth century designers who did so much to popularize them.{{cn|date=June 2016}} 

It is difficult to talk about the history and style of Scandinavian rugs without mentioning Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom. One of the most important figures in the entire history of Scandinavian rug-making, Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom was a mid-twentieth century rug designer whose pieces are among the most noteworthy rugs ever designed.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;  Working from 1919 until her death in 1941, Maas-Fjetterstrom focused on creating rugs that communicated the intimacy of the natural world through a [[modernist]] approach to lines and geometric figures. With pieces in some of the most exclusive art museums in the world and an outsized reputation in the design world more than 70 years after her death, Maas-Fjetterstrom’s accomplishments illustrate the importance of Scandinavian rugs.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

== Modern design trends ==


Due largely in part to the influence of Marta Maas-Fjetterstrom, Scandinavian rugs have remained hugely popular over the past 70 years. Indeed, since her death in 1941, the demand for rugs made after her distinctive style has risen meteorically.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt; Maas-Fjetterstrom, upon her death, left to posterity more than 700 designs for rugs, along with meticulously detailed instructions for how to make them, including the different techniques that should be utilized in their manufacture. In addition to an enormous body of her own original work, Maas-Fjetterstrom also inspired a great many artists whose rugs are hugely desirable all over the world.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Rug designed by artists such as Ann-Mari Forsberg, Barvro Nilsson, Marianne Richter, and others are available, and are hand-made in Maas-Fjetterstrom’s original studio in [[Bastad]], where rugs have been hand-made since 1919.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt; It is difficult to overstate the influence that these designers and their works have had on the world of interior design. Even as tastes have changed since the 1920s and 1930s when Maas-Fjetterstrom herself was designing rugs, there is a quality to Scandinavian rugs that has intrigued leading designers and decorators for decades. If there is any one trend in the world of artisanal rugs, it is the increasing popularity of Scandinavian rugs.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Many mid-twentieth century designers, interior decorators, and modern visionaries have been impressed by the uniquely sparse and geometric composition of traditional Scandinavian rugs, and most especially by those designed by Maas-Fjetterstrom and her peers. The attention to detail and treatment of color in Maas-Fjetterstrom rugs—as well as the approach to geometry and line theory in the most well-known pieces—combine to create just the sort of piece that perfectly complements the design aesthetic of individuals such as [[Ray Eames]], [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. A large reason behind the tremendous popularity enjoyed by mid-century Scandinavian rugs is the heavy incorporation of such pieces into these individuals' own design work.&lt;ref name="mmf" /&gt;

Galleries and design studios throughout the world have recently begun to invest heavily in those Scandinavian rugs that are considered to be the best and the most representative of the aesthetic values of the famous mid-century modern Scandinavian rug-makers and designers. Galleries that specialize in antique rugs, such as the [[Nazmiyal collection]] in [[New York City]], buy and sell a tremendous amount of Scandinavian rugs, underscoring the growing popularity of such pieces and the increased public demand for Scandinavian rugs. The increased demand for such rugs by galleries and studios is tied to a very real increased demand from decorators, collectors, and consumers.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The growing influence of Scandinavian rug-makers is an affirmation of the importance of the craft to the Swedish people. While not an artistic tradition of Scandinavian origin, rug-making has become a very important avenue of artistic expression in Scandinavia. As the taste for Scandinavian carpets and rugs continues to grow throughout the world, Scandinavian rug-makers will continue to produce unique and enduring works that represent those design elements and aesthetic ideals most important to the culture of the region.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The '''Schnütgen Museum''' ('''Museum Schnütgen''' in German) in [[Cologne]] (Köln), [[Germany]] is devoted to Christian religious art, mainly [[medieval art|medieval]], but some parts of the collection, such as its [[textile]]s and prints, extend from [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] to the modern period.  In 1906, the collection of Alexander Schnütgen was donated to the city, and the collection has continued to expand, so that until the opening of a new building in 2010, only about 10% of its 13,000 items could be displayed. Now some 2,000 objects are on display in 1900 sq. metres of gallery space, with an additional 1300 sq. metres for special exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=1920&amp;tid=253&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum website, English page], accessed May 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Schnütgen (1843–1918) was a Catholic priest and theologian;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Alexander Schnütgen|Biography on German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the museum website "Up to now people tell stories about his zealous and sometimes crafty collection tactics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/english/default.asp?s=254&amp;tid=125&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museums of Cologne Art of the Middle Ages Museum Schnütgen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227223813/http://www.museenkoeln.de/english/default.asp?s=254&amp;tid=125&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= |date=2009-12-27 }}. Museums of Cologne. Accessed January 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1956, the museum has occupied the large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of [[St. Cäcilien]], founded in 881 for noble canonesses, with the present building dating from 1130–60, with murals from about 1300.  An annex built by architect [[Karl Band]] was added in the 1950s, and new buildings (part of the ''Kulturquartier, “Culture quarter“'') opened in 2010. Highlights of the collection include a Romanesque [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] from St Cecilia's itself, several large wooden [[crucifix]]es, including the 11th century ''Cross of St George's'', as well as a large collection of early bronze ones, including the only other work generally attributed to [[Rainer of Huy]] apart from his [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|Liège baptismal font]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 181&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum has a late Carolingian [[evangeliary]] of 860–880, and a single leaf from the English [[St Albans Psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=967&amp;tid=188&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum highlights 2nd and 4th items - Handschriften und Einzelblätter].

Alexander Schnütgen had organised influential exhibitions of his collection while it was still private, and from the 1970s the museum (using extra exhibition spaces) organized a series of landmark exhibitions of medieval art:

* ''Rhein und Maas'' (1972, [[Mosan art]])
* ''Monumenta Annonis – Köln und Siegburg. Weltbild und Kunst im hohen Mittelalter'' (1975)
* ''Die [[Peter Parler|Parler]] und der [[International Gothic|schöne Stil]] 1350–1400, Europäische Kunst unter [[House of Luxembourg|den Luxemburgern]]'' (1978)
* ''Ornamenta Ecclesia – Kunst und Künstler der Romanik '' (1985, Romanesque metalwork and other church art)
* ''Himmelslicht. Europäische Glasmalerei im Jahrhundert des Kölner Dombaus (1248–1349)'' (1998, [[stained glass]]).

The enormous catalogues for these exhibitions, some running to three volumes, remain important works of reference. Catalogues of the permanent collection of the museum are being published in several volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=514&amp;tid=162&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum website Bestandskatalog].

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish art''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in what is now Scotland, or about Scottish subjects, since prehistoric times. It forms a distinctive tradition within European art, but the political union with England has led its partial subsumation in [[British art]].

The earliest examples of art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the [[Neolithic]] period. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]]. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the [[Iron Age]]. Elaborately carved [[Pictish stone]]s and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of [[Insular art]] across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the [[Renaissance]] can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. [[Scottish Reformation|The Reformation]] removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court as a result of the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as [[George Jamesone]] and [[John Michael Wright]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the eighteenth century Scotland began to produce artists that were significant internationally, all influenced by [[neoclassicism]], such as [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], [[Jacob More]] and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Towards the end of the century [[Romanticism]] began to influence artistic production, and can be seen in the portraits of artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]]. It also contributed to a tradition of Scottish landscape painting that focused on the [[Highlands]], formulated by figures including [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. The [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] was created in 1826, and major portrait painters of this period included [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]. [[William Dyce]] emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The beginnings of a [[Celtic Revival]] can be seen in the late nineteenth century and the art scene was dominated by the work of the [[Glasgow Boys]] and the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The early twentieth century was dominated by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. [[Modernism]] enjoyed popularity during this period, with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce successful and influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Scotland possess significant collections of art, such as the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow. Significant schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in Scotland is [[Creative Scotland]]. Support is also given by local councils and independent foundations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The oldest known examples of art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late [[Neolithic]] era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name="Towie"&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D.

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]]. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are believed to be the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G.

===Middle Ages===

{{See also|Scotland in the Middle Ages}}
In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], four distinct linguistic and political groupings existed in what is now Scotland, each of which produced distinct material cultures. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the [[River Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Stirling Heads]] showing [[James V of Scotland|James V]]]]
Beginning in the fifteenth century, a number of works were produced in Scotland by artists imported from the continent, particularly the [[Netherlands]], generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]];&lt;ref name="Webster1997pp127-9"/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; and [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], such as those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name="Glendinningetal1996p14"&gt;M.

At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and like the surviving carved oak portrait [[Boss (architecture)|roundels]] from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Reformation===
{{Main article|Art in early modern Scotland|Portrait painting in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
During the sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that created a predominantly Calvinist national [[Church of Scotland]] (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Protestant [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Oxford: Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1859735088}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A self-portrait by George Jamesone.jpeg|thumb|left|Self portrait of [[George Jamesone]] (1642)]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth Earl of Seaton (c. 1570s).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94).&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in Devine and Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enlightenment period====
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]]. The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=scottish+artists+italy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=KQipT-rINemP4gTboeyOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20artists%20italy&amp;f=false ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Hamilton studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome for the rest of his life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where John died in 1768/9. Alexander returned home to gain a reputation as a landscape and portrait painter. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p554"&gt;I.

He produced historical and mythical scenes before moving to England, where he pursued portraiture. He then returned to Edinburgh in 1780, became director and master of the [[Academy of Arts]] in 1786. Here he produced his most famous work, with illustrations of themes from Scottish life, earning him the title of "the Scottish Hogarth".&lt;ref name="Houghton2003pp34-5"&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), {{ISBN|0-618-25210-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanticism====
{{See also|Romanticism in Scotland|Scottish genre art}}
Scotland played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in [[German language|German]] literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554/&gt;&lt;ref name=Houghton2003pp34-5/&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name="Withers2001pp151-3"&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E.

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|''Highland Loch Landscape'' by [[Alexander Nasmyth]]]]
The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century artists including [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.

====Painting====
[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
[[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in [[Highland dress]] commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C. Williams, "The visual image of nineteenth-century Cairo", in thabet abdullah and M. Jones, eds, ''Arab and Islamic Studies'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1997), {{ISBN|9774244028}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name="Szasz200p136"&gt;F.

This was helped by [[Queen Victoria]]'s declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009p27"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136/&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter. He has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the "Scottish Impressionist", with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|right|Alexander and Bucephalus by [[John Steell]] (1832)]]
In the early decades of the century, sculpture commissions in Scotland were often given to English artists. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790 – 1858) and [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) undertook work in Scotland, but worked for much of their careers in London and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' (1832). His 1832 design for a statue of [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] to the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside. Public sculpture was boosted by the anniversary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in [[Leith]]. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for [[Dundee]], London and [[Dunedin]]. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early photography====
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|'His Faither's Breeks', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]]]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name="Burn2011"&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0486267504}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93), who pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[Clementina Hawarden]] (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.&lt;ref&gt;G. Clarke, ''The Photograph'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0192842005}}, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of the Pre-Raphaelites====
{{See also|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[William Dyce]] [[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (1858–60?)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail, but puts the biblical subjects in a distinctly Scottish landscape, against the Pre-Raphaelite precept of truth in all things. His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyce became head of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the [[Royal College of Art]], where his ideas formed the basis of the system of training and he was highly involved in the national organisation of art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p209&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855).&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millias was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work included ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arts and Crafts and the Celtic Revival====
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement|Celtic Revival}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: the People's Designer – 1834–1904'' (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reptilian Fabric.jpg|thumb|left|Textile pattern by [[Christopher Dresser]] (1887)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p170"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Glasgow School====
{{Main article|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', by [[Frances Macdonald]] (1909)]]
For the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly represented by the Royal Academy, were often influenced by French painting and incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]], and have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art, making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Colourists====
{{Main article|Scottish Colourists}}
The next significant group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

====Edinburgh School====
{{Main article|The Edinburgh School}}
The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, became known as the Edinburgh School.&lt;ref name="EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool"&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School "The Edinburgh School"], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"&gt;D.

====Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance====
{{See also|Modernism|Scottish Renaissance}}
[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''The Regatta'' (1913)]]
Patrick Geddes coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that technological development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970) and [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981).&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"/&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century".&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p173"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting McIntosh Patrick first gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Scottish Group====
{{Main article|New Scottish Group}}
[[File:JD Fergusson, People and Sails.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. D. Fergusson]], ''People and Sails'' (1910)]]
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, J. D. Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th Century, 1890–2001'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (born 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1/&gt;{{clear}}

Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (b. 1912–2004), [[Margaret Mellis]] (b. 1914–2009).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (born 1920),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]] and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]]. His most ambitious work, the garden of [[Little Sparta]] opened in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=K.

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (born 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, both grouped under the description of "Scottish realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups"&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255/&gt; and included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (born 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (born 1960) and Adrian Wiszniewski (born 1958). Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work has a comic book-like quality and puts an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wiszniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopts a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employs figures reminiscent characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011"&gt;D. Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie has revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints ''The Saracen Heads'' (1988).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011p406&gt;Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary sculpture===
While sculptors [[Eric Schilsky]] (1898–1974) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93) worked in the existing tradition of modelling and carving,&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; sculptor and artist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.&lt;ref name="Roseetal2012p25"&gt;L.

MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, including Jake Harvey (born 1948), Doug Cocker (born 1945), Ainslie Yule (born 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; In contrast [[Sandy Stoddart]] (born 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Clive Aslet, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3556356/Alexander-Stoddart-talking-statues.html "Alexander Stoddart: talking statues"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', retrieved 12 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographic renaissance===
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:sandy smith object moved edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The first room of the installation ''The Object Moved by its Own Success'', by [[Sandy Smith]] and [[Alex Gross]] (2008)]]
In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (born 1951), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (born 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow School of Art]], designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]]]
Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century, many of which continue to exist in different forms today. [[Edinburgh College of Art]] developed from the Trustees Academy founded in the city in 1760 and was established in 1907. After a long independent history, in 2011 it became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8523596/Edinburgh-College-of-Art-guide.html ''Edinburgh College of Art guide''], ''The Telegraph'', 20 June 2011, retrieved 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845. [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen was founded in 1885. [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]] was founded in Dundee in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold and D. P.

===Organisations===
[[Creative Scotland]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in Scotland. It superseded the [[Scottish Arts Council]], which was formed in 1994 following a restructuring of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], but had existed as an [[autonomous]] body since a [[royal charter]] of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''Symphony No. 10''' is the tenth symphony by the American composer [[Philip Glass]].  The work was commissioned by the Orchestre Français des Jeunes and premiered August 9, 2012, with [[Dennis Russell Davies]] conducting the Orchestre Français des Jeunes at the Grand Théâtre de Provence in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Glass10" /&gt;  The piece had its [[United Kingdom]] premiere July 31, 2013 at [[The Proms]] in [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prom 25: Zappa – The Adventures of Greggery Peccary |work=[[BBC]] |date=2013 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/2010s/2013/july-31/14638 |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony reworks music originally written as ''Los paisajes del rio'' for the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]], premiered at the 2008 Expo Zaragoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Daniel Stephen |title=Philip Glass Blasts Past Beethoven with Fireworks of 10th Symphony |publisher=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=July 27, 2015 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/philip-glass-blasts-past-beethoven-fireworks-10th-symphony/ |accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the famed [[curse of the ninth]], Glass composed the piece before the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Glass)|Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web |last=Saer |first=Arabella |title=Glass's 10th Symphony, Grand Théâtre de Provence, Aix-en-Provence |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 12, 2012 |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c4127220-e2da-11e1-bf02-00144feab49a.html |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s (II doubled on [[E-flat clarinet]], III doubled on [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[Types of trombone#bass trombone|bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], six  [[Percussion instrument|percussionists]] ([[Tubular bells|chimes]], [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]]s, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[anvil]], [[gong|tamtam]], [[clash cymbals]], [[castanets]], [[wood block]], [[snare drum]], [[tenor drum]], [[bass drum]]), [[celesta]], [[piano]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Glass10" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere at the Grand Théâtre de Provence, Arabella Saer of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' lauded the symphony, writing:{{quote|There were enough typical Glass elements – repeated arpeggios, chugging chords, cross-rhythms and pared-down harmony – for the 35-minute piece to win no new converts. But there was also a cool, fresh energy about it, arising as much, perhaps, from the ''jeunesse'' of the players and the sleek, modern hall (only five years old), as from the fact that Glass must have had a youth orchestra – ''this'' youth orchestra – in mind when he wrote it.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;}}
Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' later opined, "Its extrovert origins as latter-day fireworks music remain clear, though, as Glass's orchestration, with its brassy edge and martial percussion – lots of snare drum – underlines in Davies's performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clements |first=Andrew |title=Glass: Symphony No 10; Concert Overture CD review – an extrovert celebration |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/glass-symphony-no-10-concert-overture-cd-review |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pwyll ap Siôn of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' also gave the work moderate praise, writing:{{quote|The work opens and ends effectively enough with a darkly exuberant first and flamboyant fifth. Deprived of their extra-musical clothing, some of the other movements lack variety and substance, however. The slow second's gradually unfolding two-note melody is only enlivened by pulsing patterns in percussion and brass, while the third’s endless tonic-dominant oscillations and the fourth’s paradiddle patterns struggle to hold interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siôn |first=Pwyll ap |title=GLASS Symphony No 10.

'''TAN Books''' is a [[traditional Catholic]] American book distributor and publisher based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]]. 

==History==
TAN Books was founded in 1967, as "TAN Books and Publishers," in [[Rockford, Illinois]] by Thomas A. Nelson (not to be confused with the founder of the Bible-publishing firm [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]) to keep in print books teaching the traditional Catholic faith in the wake of the upheaval in the Church that followed the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About TAN|url=http://www.tanbooks.com/abouttan.htm|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206053705/http://www.tanbooks.com/abouttan.htm|archivedate=1998-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name was formed from the initials of its founder. Over the next 40 years, TAN published hundreds of new and classic titles on theology, Scripture, Church history, traditional devotions (including St. [[Louis de Montfort]]'s ''[[Secret of the Rosary]]'', printing more than 4 million copies), and the lives of the saints, many of which were reprints of titles published by such notable American Catholic publishers as [[Benziger Brothers]] and B. Herder Book Company. 

In 1971, TAN republished the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]], which had fallen out of print by the late 1960s, photographically reproducing it from the 1899 John Murphy &amp; Co. edition. In the 1990s, with the advent of computer-based word processing, TAN began re-typesetting many of the titles in its catalog, rather than relying solely upon photographic reproductions of out-of-print works. In 2004, actor and director [[Mel Gibson]]'s [[Icon Productions]] granted TAN the license to publish the Catholic edition of ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie'' [[The Passion of the Christ]], a collection of photographs of scenes from the film accompanied with excerpts from the film's screenplay and quotations from the Douay–Rheims.

Financial problems led TAN to file for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection in 2005. The company was subsequently acquired by [[Saint Benedict Press]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintbenedictpress.com/ Saint Benedict Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Following its acquisition, "TAN Books and Publishers" was renamed "TAN Books," with the "TAN" acronym now standing for ''Tuum Adoramus Nomen'' (Latin for "Let Us Adore Thy Name"). The company has aimed to improve the quality of its products by commissioning more aesthetically-pleasing covers, employing more durable book construction, and continuing to re-typeset numerous titles in its catalog.

On October 31, 2018, TAN published its first foray into current affairs nonfiction, ''The Smoke of Satan: How Corrupt and Cowardly Bishops Betrayed Christ, His Church, and the Faithful . . . and What Can Be Done About It'' by Catholic journalist Philip F. Lawler, in response to the 2018 resurgence of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse cases]] in the Church. TAN Books/Saint Benedict Press president and CEO Robert Gallagher, in his preface to the book, described the work as "the most difficult book we at TAN have published", as well as "one of the most important".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawler |first1=Philip F. |title=The Smoke of Satan: How Corrupt and Cowardly Bishops Betrayed Christ, His Church, and the Faithful . . . and What Can Be Done About It |date=2018 |publisher=TAN Books |location=Charlotte, NC |isbn=9781505113495 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprints==
* '''TAN Books:''' Publishes reprints of classic Catholic works on theology, Scripture, traditional devotions, the [[Tridentine Mass]], and lives of the saints, as well as new titles on these subjects by contemporary authors and a line of newly-typeset [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay–Rheims Bibles]] (co-branded with Saint Benedict Press). In addition, the former "Saint Benedict Press Classics" series is now marketed under the "TAN Classics" moniker. TAN has also, in recent years, published resources aimed toward Catholic [[homeschooling]] families.
* '''Confraternity of the Precious Blood:''' TAN currently serves as the distributor of reprints of classic works published by members of the Confraternity, such as ''My Daily Bread'' and ''My Imitation of Christ''.
* '''Neumann Press:''' Acquired by TAN Books in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Jessica| title = Shower of Roses: Tan Books Acquires Neumann Press!| work = Shower of Roses| accessdate = 2016-07-03| date = 2013-10-23| url = http://showerofroses.blogspot.com/2013/10/tan-books-acquires-neumann-press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = TAN Books| title = TAN Books Acquires Neumann Press| accessdate = 2016-07-03| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tan-books-acquires-neumann-press-228905321.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann Press republishes classic Catholic children's works, history books, and novels aimed at students from primary to secondary school.
* '''American Chesterton Society:''' Since May 2015, TAN Books has been the exclusive distributor of works published by the Society, which specializes in contemporary titles written in the tradition of Catholic philosopher [[G. K. Chesterton]].

==Criticism==
Since TAN's acquisition by Saint Benedict Press and the end of Nelson's involvement with the company, some traditionalist Catholics have expressed displeasure with TAN due to their perception that the company has abandoned its prior firmly-traditionalist editorial policy in favor of one intended to cater to conservative Catholics who, while doctrinally orthodox, accept the changes in Catholic practice that followed the Second Vatican Council. They cite, among others, the removal from TAN's catalog of works questioning the validity and/or rubrical integrity of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] (''The Great Sacrilege'' by Father James Wathen; ''Liturgical Time Bombs in Vatican II'' by [[Michael Davies (Catholic writer)|Michael Davies]]; ''[[Ottaviani Intervention|The Ottaviani Intervention]]'', translated with commentary by Father [[Anthony Cekada]]), works questioning the orthodoxy of the Council itself (''In the Murky Waters of Vatican II'' by Atila Sinke Guimarães), criticism of modern Bible translations (''Which Bible Should You Read?'' by Thomas A. Nelson), as well as works expressing Church teachings that, they claim, conflict with the post-conciliar emphases on [[Ecumenism (Catholic Church)|ecumenism]] and religious liberty.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''''The Farmers' Lunch''''' (''Almuerzo de campesinos'') is one of the earliest paintings by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Diego Velázquez]]. Painted in oil on canvas in 1618, it combines a [[still life]] of food and drink with a depiction of three comic farmers, whose [[physiognomy]] the artist studies closely. The composition shows a younger man gesturing with his right hand to reinforce the story coming from his half-open lips, and an older man listening attentively while holding his cup up to a woman so she can refill it with wine. The still life includes fish, bread, a carrot, a lemon, and a copper vessel.

''The Farmers' Lunch'' is nearly identical to  another painting by Velázquez, ''[[The Lunch (Velázquez)|The Lunch]]'' (ca. 1617).

'''''The Founding Ceremony of the Nation''''' (or '''''The Founding of the Nation''''', {{lang-zh|c=开国大典|p=Kāiguó Dàdiǎn}}) is a 1953 [[oil painting]] by Chinese artist [[Dong Xiwen]].  It depicts [[Mao Zedong]] and other [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] officials inaugurating the [[China|People's Republic of China]] at [[Tiananmen Square]] on October 1, 1949.  A prominent example of [[socialist realism]], it is one of the most celebrated works of official Chinese art.  The painting was repeatedly revised, and a replica painting made to accommodate further changes, as the leaders it depicted fell from power and later were [[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]].

After the Communists [[Chinese Communist Revolution|took control]] of China, they sought to memorialize their achievements through artworks.  Dong was commissioned to create a visual representation of the October 1 ceremony, which he had attended.  He viewed it as essential that the painting show both the people and their leaders.  After working for three months, he completed an oil painting in a [[folk art]] style, drawing upon Chinese art history for the contemporary subject.  The success of the painting was assured when Mao viewed it and liked it, and it was reproduced in large numbers for display in the home.

The 1954 [[purge]] of [[Gao Gang]] from the government resulted in Dong being ordered to remove him from the painting.  Gao's departure was not the last; Dong was forced to remove [[Liu Shaoqi]] in 1967.  The winds of political fortune continued to shift during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and a reproduction was painted by other artists in 1972 to accommodate another deletion.  That replica was modified in 1979 to include the purged individuals, who had been rehabilitated.  Both canvases are in the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing.

== Background ==

Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, Communists quickly took control of [[Chinese art#Communist and socialist art (1950–1980s)|art in China]].  The [[socialist realism]] that was characteristic of [[Soviet art]] came to be highly influential in the People's Republic. The new government proposed a series of paintings, preferably in oil, to memorialize the history of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), and its triumph in 1949.  To this end, in December 1950, arts official Wang Yeqiu proposed to Deputy Minister of Culture [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]] that there be an art exhibition the following year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party in China.  Wang had toured the Soviet Union and observed its art, with which he was greatly impressed, and he proposed that sculptures and paintings be exhibited depicting the CPC's history, for eventual inclusion in the planned Museum of the Chinese Revolution.  Even before gaining full control of the country, the CPC had used art as [[propaganda]], a technique especially effective as much of the Chinese population was then illiterate.  Wang's proposal was preliminarily approved in March 1951, and a committee, including the art critic and official [[Jiang Feng (artist)|Jiang Feng]], was appointed to seek suitable artists.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=785–786}}  Although nearly 100 paintings were produced for the 1951 exhibition, not enough were found to be suitable, and it was cancelled.&lt;ref name="cn19"&gt;{{cite web|title=《开国大典》油画曾四次修改 哪些人被删除了？(''Founding Ceremony'' painting has been modified four times: who was deleted?|publisher=ifeng.com|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|author=Wu Jijin|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguoxiandaishi/detail_2011_01/04/3933709_0.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Founding Ceremony B.jpg|thumb|left|''The Founding Ceremony of the Nation'' on exhibit along with artifacts of the October 1, 1949 ceremony. National Museum of China. Seen in 2018.]]
The use of oil paintings to memorialize events and make a political statement was not new; 19th-century examples include [[John Trumbull]]'s paintings for the [[United States Capitol#Art|United States Capitol]] (1817–1821) and [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' (1807).{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=785}} Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce a wide range of realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional Chinese ink and brush painting.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=789}}  Wang admired how, in Moscow museums, [[Lenin]]'s career was chronicled and made accessible to the masses through artifacts accompanied by oil paintings showing crucial moments in the Communist leader's career.  He and higher-level officials decided to use a similar technique as they planned the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.  Thus, they sought to chronicle the Party's history and showcase its accomplishments.  Paintings were commissioned, even though the museum did not yet exist and would not open until 1961.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=790–792}}  Chinese leaders were eager to be presented in paintings, wanting to be immortalized as central characters in the nation's historical drama.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|pp=171–172}}

None of the works initially obtained for the museum depicted the crowning moment of the revolution, the ceremony at [[Tiananmen Square]] on October 1, 1949, when [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic.  Officials deemed such a work essential.&lt;ref name="cn1"/&gt; [[Dong Xiwen]], a professor at the [[China Central Academy of Fine Arts|Central Academy of Fine Arts]] (CAFA) in Beijing, was accomplished and politically reliable, and had been present at the October 1 ceremony: he was an obvious candidate.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=790–792}}&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;  Although Dong later complained that never in his career had he had full freedom of choice as to his paintings' subjects,{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}} ''The Founding of the Nation'' would make him famous.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;

== Subject and techniques ==
[[File:Founding Ceremony original.jpeg|thumb|right|Dong's original painting]]

The painting depicts the inaugural ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.  The focus is on Mao, who stands on [[Tiananmen Gate]]'s balcony, reading his proclamation into (originally) two microphones.{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  Dong took some liberties with the appearance of Tiananmen Gate, opening up the space in front of Mao to grant the chairman a more direct connection with his people,{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}} something that architect [[Liang Sicheng]] deemed a mistake for a builder, but artistically brilliant.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  Five [[Doves as symbols|doves]] fly into the sky to Mao's right.  Before him on Tiananmen Square, honor guards and members of patriotic organizations are assembled in orderly ranks, with some holding banners.  [[Qianmen]], the gate at the south end of the square, is visible, as is [[Yongdingmen]] gate (seen to the left of Mao).{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  Beyond the old city walls that at the time enclosed the square (they were torn down in the 1950s), the city of Beijing is visible, and in green is represented the nation of China, with those further scenes under bright sunlight and sharply defined clouds.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}  October 1 had been an overcast day in Beijing; Dong took artistic license with the weather.&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;

To Mao's left are seen his lieutenants in the Communist takeover.  In the original painting, the front row, which is ordered by rank, consisted of (from left) General [[Zhu De]], [[Liu Shaoqi]], Madame [[Song Qingling]] (the widow of [[Sun Zhongshan]]), [[Li Jishen]], [[Zhang Lan]] (with beard), and at far right, General [[Gao Gang]].  [[Zhou Enlai]] was furthest left in the second row, and beside him were [[Dong Biwu]], two men whose identities are uncertain, and furthest right, [[Guo Moruo]].  [[Lin Boqu]] was furthest left in the third row.{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  The leaders congregate close to each other, while remaining a respectful distance from Mao.  This emphasizes his primacy, as does the fact that he is depicted as taller than his lieutenants.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|pp=172–173}}  The point of view of the observer is well back on the balcony, from which most of the square would be obscured by the floor.  Rather than show only Mao and sky, Dong manipulated the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], raising the horizon and intensifying the foreshortening of the balcony.  Necessarily, only the officials and not the crowd below are represented as individuals; art historian Wu Hung wrote that "the parading masses in the Square derive strength from a collective anonymity.  The combination of the two—above and below, the leaders and the people—constitutes a comprehensive representation of New China."{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=173}}

Mao and his officials are surrounded by [[Paper lantern|lanterns]], symbols of prosperity;{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}} the [[chrysanthemum]]s on either side symbolize longevity.  The doves represent peace restored to a nation long wracked by war.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}  The new five-star [[flag of China]], rising over the people, represents the end of the [[Fengjian|feudal system]] and the rebirth of the nation as the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  Mao, who is presented as a statesman, not as the revolutionary leader he was during the conflict, faces Qianmen, aligning himself along Beijing's old imperial North-South Axis, symbolizing his authority.  The chairman is at the center of multiple, concentric circles in the painting, with the innermost formed by the front row of his comrades, another by the people in the square, and the outermost the old city walls.  Surrounding them are the sunlit scenes, envisioning a glorious future for China with Mao the heart of the nation.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=809–810}}

[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dong borrowed techniques from the [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang murals]] of the Tang Dynasty.]]
Although Dong had been trained in [[Western painting]], he chose a [[folk art]] style for ''The Founding of the Nation'', using bright, contrasting colors in a manner similar to that in [[Chinese New Year|New Year]]'s prints popular in China.  He stated in 1953, "the Chinese people like bright, intense colors.  This convention is in line with the theme of ''The Founding Ceremony of the Nation''.  In my choice of colors I did not hesitate to put aside the complex colors commonly adopted in Western painting as well as the conventional rules for oil painting."{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}  Artists in the early years of the People's Republic, including Dong, sought to satisfy Chinese aesthetic tastes in their works and so depicted their subjects in  bright original color, avoiding complex use of light and shadow on faces as in many Western paintings.{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=65}}  By European standards, the painting's colors are overly intense and saturated.  The color [[vermilion]] was used for large areas of the columns, the carpets, and the lanterns, setting a tone for the work.  The blooming flowers, the flags and banners, and the blue and white sky all give the painting a happy atmosphere{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}—a joyful, festive air, as well as giving "cultural sublimity", appropriate for a work depicting the founding of a nation.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dong Xiwen, ''The Founding Ceremony''|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/549/Default.aspx?AntiqueLanguageID=2421|publisher=[[National Museum of China]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dong drew upon Chinese art history, using techniques from [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang murals]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] portraits, and ancient figure paintings. Patterns on the carpet, columns, lanterns, and railing evoke cultural symbols.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"/&gt;  The colors of the painting are reminiscent of crudely printed rural [[woodcut]]s; this is emphasized by the black outlines of a number of objects, including the pillars and stone railing, as those outlines are characteristic of such woodcuts.{{sfn|Andrews|p=82}}  Dong noted, "If this painting is rich in national styles, it is largely because I adopted these [native] approaches."{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}

== Composition ==

[[File:Tiananmen beijing Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Tiananmen Gate]], photographed in 2009]]

''The Founding of the Nation'' was one of several paintings commissioned for the new Museum of the Chinese Revolution from faculty members at CAFA.  Two of these, Luo Gongliu's ''Tunnel Warfare'' and Wang Shikuo's ''Sending Him Off to the Army'', were completed in 1951; ''The Founding of the Nation'' was finished the following year.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=76–79}}  These commissions were regarded as from the government and were highly prestigious.  State assistance, such as access to archives, was available.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=791–792}}

At the time CAFA chose Dong, he was painting workers at the [[Shijingshan District|Shijingshan]] power plant outside Beijing.  Dong reviewed the photographs of the event, but found them unsatisfactory as none showed both the leaders and the people gathered in the square below, which he felt was necessary.  He created a postcard-size sketch, but was dissatisfied with it, feeling it did not capture the grandeur of the occasion.  Taking advice from other artists, Dong made adjustments to his plan.&lt;ref name="cn3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.ifeng.com/8/detail_2013_04/19/24398291_0.shtml|publisher=ifeng.com|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2017|title=揭秘《开国大典》油画：增高毛泽东删除刘少奇 (Secret ''Founding Ceremony'' painting increased Mao Zedong, removed Liu Shaoqi)|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dong rented a small room in western Beijing above a store selling [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;  Jiang intervened to give Dong time and space to create the painting;{{sfn|Andrews|pp=76–79}} the artist needed three months to complete his work.  The room was smaller than the painting, which is four meters wide, and Dong would affix part of the canvas to the ceiling, working on his back.  To save commuting time, he slept in a chair.  He smoked cigarettes constantly as he worked.  His daughter brought meals, but he was often unable to eat.  Once the painting was under way, several of Dong's colleagues, including oil painter {{ill|Ai Zhongxin|zh|艾中信}}, came to visit.  They decided that the figure of Mao, the central one of the painting, was not tall enough.  Dong removed the figure of Mao from the canvas, and painted him again, increasing his height by just under an inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;

In painting the sky and the pillars, Dong used a pen and brush, as if doing a traditional Chinese painting.  He depicted the clothing in detail; Madame Song wears gloves showing flowers, while Zhang Lan's silk robe appears carefully ironed for the momentous day.&lt;ref name="cn7"/&gt;  Dong used [[sawdust]] to enhance the texture of the carpet on which Mao stands;{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}} he painted the marble railing as yellowish rather than white, thus emphasizing the age of the Chinese nation.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  The leaders in the painting were asked to examine their portraits for accuracy.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=172}}

== Reception and prominence ==

When the painting was unveiled in 1953, most Chinese critics were enthusiastic.  [[Xu Beihong]], the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired the manner in which the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=65}}  He and others, though, saw that the painting opened a new chapter in Chinese art development.{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}  Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that it was more a poster than an oil painting.  Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as ''Kazakh Shepherdess'' (1947) and ''Liberation'' (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art.&lt;ref name="cn7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artxun.com/youhua-953-4761866.shtml|language=zh|date=March 24, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2017|title=油画《开国大典》的成功与蒙难 (The success and difficulty of the oil painting ''Founding Ceremony'')|author=Ai Zhongxin|publisher=Bo Po Art Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senior Party leaders, though, approved of the painting, as art historian Chang-Tai Hung put it, "seeing it as a testament to the young nation's evolving identity and growing confidence".{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}

Soon after the unveiling, Jiang wanted to arrange an exhibition at which government officials, including Mao, could view and publicly endorse the new Chinese art.  He had connections in Mao's inner circle, and Dong and others organized it to be in conjunction with meetings at [[Zhongnanhai]] that Mao led. This was, most likely, the only time Mao attended an art exhibition after 1949.  Mao visited the exhibition three times in between meetings and especially liked ''The Founding of the Nation''—the official photograph of the event shows Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] viewing the canvas with Dong.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  The chairman stared at the painting for a long time and finally said, "It is a great nation.  It really is a great nation."{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=172}}  Mao also stated that the portrayal of [[Dong Biwu]] was particularly well rendered.  As Dong Biwu was in the second row, mostly hidden by the large [[Zhu De]], Mao was most likely joking, but the favorable reaction by the country's leader assured the success of the painting.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}

''The Founding of the Nation'' was hailed as one of the greatest oil paintings ever by a Chinese artist by reviewers in that country, and more than 500,000 reproductions were sold in three months.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}}  Mao's praise helped boost the painting and its painter.  Dong's techniques were seen as bridging the gap between the elitist medium of oil painting and popular art, and as a boost to Jiang's position that realistic art could be politically desirable.{{sfn|Andrews|p=82}}  It was reproduced in primary and secondary school textbooks.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  The painting appeared on the front page of ''[[People's Daily]]'' in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration.  One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of ''The Founding of the Nation'' on the wall.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=80–81}}  According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting "became a celebrated propaganda piece".{{sfn|C. Hung 2005|p=920}}

== Later history and political changes ==
In February 1954 [[Gao Gang]], the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later.  His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary.  Given its popularity among officials and the people, ''The Founding of the Nation'' had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted.  Accordingly Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=82–83}}

[[File:Founding of the Nation 1955 revision.jpeg|thumb|left|1954 revision, [[Gao Gang]] deleted]]
In erasing Gao, Dong expanded the basket of pink chrysanthemums which stands at the officials' feet, and completed the depiction of  Yongdingmen gate, in the original seen only in part behind Gao.  He was forced to expand the section of sky seen above the people assembled in Tiananmen Square, which affected the placement of Mao as the center of attention.  He compensated for this, to some extent, by adding two more microphones to Mao's right. Julia Andrews, in her book on the art of the People's Republic, suggested that Dong's solution was not entirely satisfactory as the microphones dominate the center of the painting, and Mao is diminished by the expanded space around him.  The modified painting was shown in the 1955 exhibition, and in 1958 in Moscow.  Although the painting was later altered again and does not exist in this form, this version is the one most commonly reproduced.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=82–83}}

When the Museum of the Chinese Revolution opened on Tiananmen Square in 1961, the painting was displayed on a huge wall in the gallery devoted to the Communist triumph, but in 1966, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], radicals shut down the museum, and it remained closed until 1969.{{sfn|C. Hung 2005|p=931}}  During that time, [[Liu Shaoqi]], accused of taking a "capitalist road", was purged from government.  His removal from the painting was ordered in 1967, and Dong was tasked to carry it out.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}}  Dong had suffered during the Cultural Revolution: accused of being a rightist, he was expelled from the Party for two years, sent to a rural [[Labor camp|work camp]], and then was "[[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]]" by being made to labor as a steelworker.&lt;ref name="cn1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Communist Party of China]]|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/85037/8101458.html|title=受党内斗争影响数遭劫难的油画《开国大典》(''Founding Ceremony'', an oil painting devastated several times by the conflict within the Party)|author=Gao Jimin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dong's task was difficult, as Liu was one of the most prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song.  Officials wanted Liu replaced with [[Lin Biao]], much in Mao's favor at the time.  Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu.  The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row.  According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: "the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended.  Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, a strangely malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group".{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable.  Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}

[[File:Founding ceremony 2.jpg|thumb|right|The replica painting (1979 revision)]]
In 1972, as part of a renovation of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that [[Lin Boqu]], whose white-haired figure was furthest left, must be removed.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  This was because the [[Gang of Four]], then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with [[Jiang Qing]] (one of the Four).  Sources differ on what took place regarding the painting: Chang-Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not make the changes, so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work.  The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}}  According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"/&gt;

With the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the subsequent accession of [[Deng Xiaoping]], many of the purged figures of earlier years were [[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]], and the authorities in 1979 decided to bring more historical accuracy to the painting.  Dong had died in 1973; his family strongly opposed anyone altering the original painting, and the government respected their wishes.  Jin was on a tour outside China, so the government assigned Yan Zhenduo to make changes to the replica.  He placed Liu, Lin Boqu and Gao in the painting{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}} and made other changes: a previously unidentifiable man in the back row now resembles Deng Xiaoping.  The replica painting was restored to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.{{sfn|Andrews|p=85}}

The painting was reproduced on [[Postage stamps and postal history of China#People's Republic of China|Chinese postage stamps]] in 1959 and 1999, for the tenth and fiftieth anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="scott 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloetzel (editor)|first=James E.|title=Scott 2007 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue: Volume 2 C–F|publisher=Scott Publishing Co.|date=2006|location=Sidney, OH|pages=324, 365|isbn=978-0-89487-376-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1999, the museum authorized a private company to make small-scale gold foil reproductions of the painting.  Dong's family sued, and in 2002 the courts found that Dong's heirs held the copyright to the painting, and that the museum only had the right to exhibit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 28, 2002|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|url=http://www.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2002/12/id/29107.shtml|title=著名油画《开国大典》著作权案在京审结 (The famous painting ''Founding Ceremony'' copyright case concluded in Beijing|publisher=Xinhua News Service|author=Zha Xin, Li Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe McDonald of the [[Associated Press]] deemed the upholding of the copyright "a triumph for China's capitalist ambitions over its leftist history".&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Joe|title=Artist's rights upheld in China|subscription=yes|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/100EEF7976AEF474?p=AWNB|date=December 29, 2002|accessdate=January 27, 2017|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the art museum at CAFA held a retrospective of Dong's works, exhibiting the small-scale draft of the painting, possessed by Dong's family, for the first time.  Fan Di'an, curator of the exhibition, stated, "The changes to the painting tell a bitter story, reflecting the political influences on art.

Wu Hung described ''The Founding of the Nation'' as "arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art".{{sfn|Wu Hung 2008|p=69}}  He noted that the painting is the only "canonized" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=274}}  The painting is a modern-day example of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person.{{sfn|Unverzagt|p=220}}  Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting "the most significant historical image of China's founding".&lt;ref name="cd2014"/&gt;  Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=274}}  Andrews wrote that "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting".{{sfn|Andrews|pp=77, 80}}  Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles".{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}  The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen".{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  Art historian [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]] dismissed it as mere propaganda.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the [[National Museum of China]], on Tiananmen Square.&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="china museum 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern China|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/545/Default.aspx|publisher=[[National Museum of China]]|accessdate=January 22, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828024211/http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/545/Default.aspx|archivedate=August 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">'''Isabelle Anna "Ziggy" Lorenc''' (pronounced "LAWR-ence") (born December 28, 1958 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] television and radio personality as well as occasional actress in film and television, best known for hosting programming on [[Citytv]], [[MuchMusic]] and [[Bravo! (Canada)|Bravo!]] after working for CHUMCity as a receptionist.

==Career==
Having done modelling work since the age of thirteen, Lorenc began pursuing acting jobs during her late teens. Hanging around aspiring performers in Toronto in the late 1970s, a group that included [[Michael Wincott]], [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tonya Lee Williams]], etc., Lorenc too went to the U.S., getting accepted at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in [[New York City]] following an audition of sorts that consisted of the school's director [[Sanford Meisner]] just speaking to the applicants.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boon|first=Mike|url=http://www.torontomike.com/2017/06/toronto_miked_podcast_episode_248.html|title=Toronto Mike'd Podcast Episode 248: Ziggy Lorenc|agency=TorontoMike.com|date=30 June 2017|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stay in New York turned out to be short, however, as she returned home to Toronto due to being unable to support herself financially in New York. 

Continuing to look for work as character actress in Toronto without much success, she worked various jobs including disco bunny at Toronto night clubs that got her an appearance on ''Boogie'', [[CITY-DT|Citytv]]'s disco local counterpart to [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. She soon met Citytv producer and creative director [[Moses Znaimer]], eventually getting a job at the station as a switchboard operator.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

===Citytv===
In parallel with working the switchboard at Citytv's 99 [[Queen Street East]] headquarters, Lorenc became part of the Switchettes — a group of young female office staffers the station sent around the city of Toronto for promotional activities and even human interest reporting.

She continued going to acting auditions and soon got a part on the Canadian sketch comedy series ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'' being shot in Toronto. Asking for time off from her Citytv duties in order to do ''Bizarre'', she got rejected eventually and left Citytv. Her time on ''Bizarre'' was short, however, as she got fired after a couple of episodes.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

Without both jobs, Lorenc began waitressing at night at Bemelmans, a popular Toronto eatery, while going to acting auditions during the day. She soon got cast as one of the romantic leads in ''[[Copper Mountain (film)|Copper Mountain]]'', a 1983 comedy that was never completed though still got a limited video release, starring young comedian [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Alan Thicke]].&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

By 1984 she was back in the Citytv fold and was on hand during the launch of [[Much Music]].

Lorenc was also the star/host of the series ''[[Life on Venus Ave.]]'' She is currently heard on [[CFZM]], hosting a late night program devoted to romantic music.

She also had roles in movies ''[[White Room (film)|White Room]]'' and ''[[Love, Sex and Eating the Bones]]''.
