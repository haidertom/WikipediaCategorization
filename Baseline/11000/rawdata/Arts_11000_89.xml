__NOTOC__
{{Wiktionary|Adam and Steve}}

"'''Adam and Steve'''" is a [[phrase]] that originated from a conservative Christian slogan "God made [[Adam and Eve]], not Adam and Steve", intended to concisely summarize [[Judeo-Christian]] Bible-based arguments against [[gay sexual practices]] or [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Victoria | title = What about the children? arguments against lesbian and gay parenting | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 555–570 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00193-5 | date = September–October 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00193-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things, it implies that the natural way of life for humanity is illustrated by the Biblical account of the [[Genesis (Bible)|creation]] of human beings as a male-female pair. The phrase "'''Madam and Eve'''" is sometimes used in reference to [[lesbian]] relationships. In Portuguese, the phrase is rendered as ''"Deus criou Adão e Eva, não Adão e Ivo".''

== History ==
The phrase appeared, on a protest sign, as early as 1977, as mentioned in a ''New York Times'' news service report about a November 19 rally in Houston that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klemesrud |first=Judy |authorlink=Judy Lee Klemesrud |title=Equal Rights Plan and Abortion Are Opposed by 15,000 at Rally |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/20/archives/equal-rights-plan-and-abortion-are-opposed-by-15000-at-rally-like-a.html |work=New York Times |date=November 20, 1977 |accessdate=2008-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used in "The Gay Bar", an episode of ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' broadcast on December 3, 1977. Two years later, [[Jerry Falwell]] gave the phrase wider circulation in a ''[[Christianity Today]]'' report of a press conference he had given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balch | first = David | title = Homosexuality, science, and the "plain sense" of Scripture | publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Mich | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8028-4698-3 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase later acquired a certain notoriety, and, when used to name a pair of characters in a work of fiction, helps to identify them as members of a homosexual pair ([[Paul Rudnick]]'s play ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hurwitt | first = Robert | title = Adam and Steve's adventures in paradise | work = San Francisco Chronicle | page = E4 | date = 21 May 2001 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Adam-and-Steve-s-adventures-in-paradise-2919586.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2005 film ''[[Adam &amp; Steve]]'' and other works). The phrase was used by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] MP [[David Simpson (Northern Ireland politician)|David Simpson]] during the British [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]]' [[Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill|debate on same-sex marriage]], although a slip of the tongue originally saying "in the Garden of Eden, it was Adam and Steve" initially caused laughter in the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hennessy | first = Mark | title = British MPs back gay marriage legislation | work = The Irish Times | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2013/0206/1224329707241.html | date = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Al Bahrani''', ({{lang-ar|'''أحمد البحراني'''}}) (born 1965) is an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] sculptor. Ahmed Al Bahrani is one of the most famous Iraqi sculptors, now living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahmed Al Bahrani," [Biographical Notes], Gary Nader Gallery, [http://garynader.com/artist-det.php?item=46 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Ahmed Al Bahrani was born  in 1965, in Tuarej on the Euphrates River, near Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;There is some confusion surrounding his place of birth. Some secondary sources, such as Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009, p. 92 state that he was born in Babylon, while other sources claim that he was born in Karbala; however in an interview, the sculptor explicitly stated that he was born in a small village, called Tuarej, near Babylon. See: "The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673]&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls that as a child, he would withdraw from the games played by other boys, to model clay on the riverbank. He also recalls that on school trips, he was taken to see some of Iraq's ancient monuments and that his reaction to them was different to other boys.&lt;ref&gt;"The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad and graduated from with a Diploma of Sculpture in 1988, &lt;ref name="BS"&gt;Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  where he was influenced by many professors, notably Abdul Rahim Al Wakil.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;Ayoub, D., "His latest works return to "Calila and Damna" Ahmed Bahrani: Arab sculptor restricted creativity," ''Emaratalyoum,'' [Dubai],  1 February, 2012, [https://www.emaratalyoum.com/life/four-sides/2012-06-02-1.488713 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has participated in several exhibitions, ''Inside and Outside Iraq, Sculpture'' in Iraq and Yemen as well as his participation in several exhibitions in Qatar, [[Beirut]] and the [[UAE]]. His sculpture is on public display in several cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Alkahaki News,'' (translated from Arabic), [http://www.alhakikanews.com/index.php/permalink/21673.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibition - Ahmed Bahrani at "Art Basel Gallery" Miami version sculpts terrorists and in his hand to save life from misunderstanding" (translated from Arabic), ''Annahar'' [newspaper], [https://newspaper.annahar.com/article/73940-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6--%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B0 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the Baghdad Institute of Fine Arts between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;

In mid-career, he decided to move away from the endlesss pursuit of abstraction and began producing figurative works. However, more recently he has returned to abstract sculpture.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt; 

In 1994, he left Iraq for political reasons, and lived in Amman, Jordan for a number of years and later resided in Yemen.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt; Since 1999, he has divided his time between Doha in Qatar and Stockholm in Sweden. &lt;ref&gt;"The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673; Nangiana, U., "Talking Sculptures," ''Gulf Times,'' 13 March, 2016, [http://www.gulf-times.com/story/484374/Talking-sculptures Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Al Bahrani's work comprises large scale sculptures of political, religious and popular figures, often carrying various type of armaments.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahmed Al- Bahrani," ''Wall Street Journal Magazine,'' 27 December, 2013, [https://wsimag.com/art/6676-ahmed-al-bahrani-war-to-war Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his contemporaries who are living in exile,&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile,; See: ''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Al Bahrani uses his work to express the sense that he is "estranged from his geographical foundation and his roots." &lt;ref&gt;Nangiana, U., "Talking Sculptures," ''Gulf Times,'' 13 March, 2016, [http://www.gulf-times.com/story/484374/Talking-sculptures Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of Tatarstan.svg|thumb|''Aq Bars'' or [[Snow Leopard]]. Symbol of the Russian republic of [[Tatarstan]].]]
'''''Aq Bars''''' (or  ''Ak Bars'') ([[Cyrillic]]: Ак Барс) is the emblem of [[Tatarstan]]. It is an ancient [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] symbol translated as "White Leopard" or "[[Snow Leopard]]", and has been in use since 1991 as the official symbol of Tatarstan.

Historically, this symbol was used in [[Volga Bulgaria]] and the [[Khanate of Kazan]] ([[Kazan|Qazan]]) - predecessors of Tatarstan - as a state symbol. The snow leopard symbol comes from the totems of one of the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] tribes - the [[Barsil]]. According to legend, the Barsils founded [[Bilär]] in [[Volga Bulgaria]].

The creator of the current emblem is the artist Rif Zägri ulı Fäxretdinev.

It was founded in 1921.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Art Institute of Pittsburgh has a 32% graduation rate and a 20% [[student loan default]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=art+institute&amp;s=PA&amp;id=210960 |title=College Navigator – The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |author= |date= |website=nces.ed.gov |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1921, the school began as a profit-based independent school of art and illustration, producing a number of notable [[artist]]s including [[watercolorist]] [[Frank Webb (watercolorist)|Frank Webb]], animation producer and director [[Rick Schneider-Calabash]], and the late science fiction illustrator [[Frank Kelly Freas]].  The Institute now specializes primarily in [[design]] disciplines and [[culinary arts]]. In 1968, [[Education Management Corporation]] (EDMC) acquired The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, and created additional schools the [[The Art Institutes|Art Institute]] system.

In 2008, it briefly became one of the largest arts colleges in the United States (factoring online enrollment). However, in 2010 enrollment began to drop, in part due to the falsification of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Osdul |first1=Paul |title=Whistle-blower accuses EDMC of falsifying records to get taxpayer money |url=http://www.wtae.com/investigations/Whistle-blower-accuses-EDMC-of-falsifying-records-to-get-taxpayer-money/18535232#!boUCmz |website=[[WTAE-TV|wtae.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers within the company sued the Institute due to practices at the online division,  and were later joined by the United States Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hechinger |first=John |title=U.S. Joins Whistleblower Suit Against Education Management |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-02/u-s-joins-whistleblower-suit-against-education-management.html |publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the 2009 public offering of EDMC, and the subsequent majority position by Goldman Sachs, emphasis throughout the EDMC system shifted increasingly toward shareholder profits with cost-cutting measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deitch |first=Charlie |title=EDMC layoffs hit Art Institutes nationwide |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/Blogh/archives/2012/08/23/edmc-layoffs-hit-art-institutes-nationwide |publisher=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]] |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in larger classes, fewer student services, and a standardized curriculum throughout the system.  This standardization removed the need for resident experts and curriculum developers at the individual colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Halperin |first=David |title=EDMC Professors and Students Speak: How Lobbyists &amp; Goldman Sachs Ruined For-Profit Education |url=http://www.republicreport.org/2012/edmc-lobbyists-goldman-sachs-ruined-for-profit-education/ |publisher=Republic Report |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Enrollment in the online division and EDMC's other online programs ballooned from 7,900 in 2007 to 42,300 in 2012, due in large part to practices that devoted more per-student expenditures to marketing ($4,158) than on education ($3,460).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deitch |first1=Charlie |title=EDMC reports revenues, enrollment down on heels of more layoffs |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/SlagHeap/archives/2012/08/09/edmc-reports-revenues-enrollment-down-on-heels-of-more-layoffs |website=pghcitypaper.com |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, however, dramatic drops in enrollment have led to massive layoffs in the online division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deitch |first1=Charlie |title=EDMC insiders report layoffs underway |url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/SlagHeap/archives/2012/01/26/edmc-insiders-report-layoffs-underway |website=pghcitypaper.com |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[PayScale|Payscale.com]] found that the institute provided the worst return on tuition of all institutes of higher learning surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/08/09/the-25-colleges-with-the-worst-return-on-investment/ |title=The 25 Colleges With The Worst Return On Investment |first=Susan |last=Adams |date= |website=forbes.com |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to disclosures the college is required to provide to the Department of Education, the overall graduation rates fell to 39% in 2012, while graduation rates among [[Pell grant]] recipients were still lower at 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduation/completion rates – The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |url=http://www.artinstitutes.edu/pdf/student-consumer-information/graduation-rate-pittsburgh.pdf65397613,d.cWc&amp;cad=rja |publisher=The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |accessdate=26 April 2014}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduation rate fell substantially further in 2014 from 39% to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduation Rates: The Art Institute of Pittsburgh |url=https://content.edmc.edu/assets/pdf/AI/Student-Consumer-Information/Graduation-Rates/graduation-rate-pittsburgh.pdf |website=www.artinstitutes.edu |publisher=EDMC Corporation |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New owners took control of EDMC in 2015, as EDMC entered into a debt-for-equity swap with its current owners, giving up the majority of their stock to creditors with whom they broke loan covenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Lisa |title=Education Management Cuts Deal to Trim Over $1B in Debt |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/12859801/1/education-management-cuts-deal-to-trim-over-1b-in-debt.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO |website=The Street |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
On March 27, 2017, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh moved to 1400 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.  During its growth phase it relocated several times, expanding and broadening the curriculum, but then later reduced offerings during its contraction period. The school purchased a [[historic landmark]] building at 420 [[Boulevard of the Allies]] in 2000, but sold the same to a Chicago developer in 2014. The Art Institute then moved to a more industrial building in the [[Strip District, Pittsburgh|Strip District]] of Pittsburgh, or "the Strip."

'''Artist's multiple''' is a series of identical [[art objects]] produced or commissioned by [[artist]] according to his or her idea,  usually a signed [[Special edition|limited edition]] made specifically for selling.

Multiples have been called the most [[accessible]] and reasonably priced [[contemporary art]] on the market, value for money.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} They could be multiples of a 2D print, 3D sculpture or installation piece. The multiple offers artists a way of selling work without compromising their artistic integrity and makes their work accessible to a wider market.

Multiples are united by their lack of uniqueness, usually regarded as a prerequisite in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.britishcouncil.org/whats_on/exhibition/11/15228 |title=Exhibitions: Multiplication |publisher=British Council |accessdate=3 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220045305/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/whats_on/exhibition/11/15228 |archivedate=20 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are by artists who work solely with the concept of the multiple. The challenge to the artist is in finding ways of realizing an idea that can be repeated time and again. Thus part of the creative challenge comes in researching new methods and sourcing new materials, leading to some unlikely collaborations between artist and fabricators.

==History==

Multiples are not a new idea. Many artists in the 20th century tinkered with the concept. Spurred on by [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-mades]], the multiple became a subversive art-form. Hand-made, [[limited edition books]] were around long before that - [[William Morris]] and [[Walter Crane]] were using [[mass production]] methods to take art to the masses true to their [[socialist]] ideals in the 19th century.

[[Marcel Duchamp]] is a forebear of multiples as they are known today. His [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-mades]] elevated everyday objects to works of art by the act of signing them. His 1935 work ''Rotoreliefs'', a set of six rotating optical discs, which were issued in an edition of 500 is one of the first true artists' multiples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74811429|title=Eye on Europe : prints, books &amp; multiples, 1960 to now|last=Deborah.|first=Wye,|date=2006|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|others=Weitman, Wendy., Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.)|isbn=9780870703713|location=New York|oclc=74811429}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Joseph Beuys]] (1921–1986) took the multiple idea further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/09/artsandhumanities.education|title=Gallery strikes a canny bargain|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|date=9 October 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disillusioned by the approach to everyday objects manifested by [[Fluxus]], Beuys wanted to reclaim the role of the object as art. He felt that as an artist he could channel energy from everyday objects and imbue them with new power and meaning. [[Wolf Vostell]]s first multiple ''Do it yourself'' was published in 1963 to go with his show at the [[Smolin Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolf Vostell. Retrospektive 92'', Edition Braus, Heidelberg 1992, {{ISBN|3-925520-44-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, artists [[Sarah Lucas]] and [[Tracey Emin]] took over a disused shop in London's East End and, with other artists friends including [[Damien Hirst]], sold T-shirts, mugs and other customized items as works of art. This artist-led approach to selling art directly to the public not only re-popularised the artists multiple, but was a key moment in the subsequent [[Young British Artist]] era, culminating in the [[Charles Saatchi]] collected "[[Sensation (exhibition)|Sensation]]" exhibition.

Since 2005, there have been vending machines produced by the association [[Un Certain Détachement]] from [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. The association was founded by artists Mary Veale, Claude Gazengel and Alain Quercia in 2005. There have been 40 contemporary artists making multiples in video, books, sculpture, design etc. All are works are individually signed and numbered and displayed in shows throughout France, including the 2011 [[Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon]].&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:CertainDetachement Vendingmachine.png|thumb|175px|right|A machine that sells signed artworks, Grenoble, France]] --&gt;

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of artist's multiples and limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more that $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Limited Edition Reproduction |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist-run initiative''' is any project run by artists, including [[Sound art|sound]] or [[visual artist]]s, to present their and others' projects. They might approximate a traditional [[art gallery]] space in appearance or function, or they may take a markedly different approach, limited only by the artist's understanding of the term. "Artist-run initiatives" is an umbrella name for many types of artist generated activity. 

One such group, the Belfast-based [[Catalyst Arts]], wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Artist-run means initiating exchange; emphasizing cross and inter-disciplinary approaches to making art; developing networks; through curation, putting creative ideas and
arguments into action" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Catalyst Arts| title = Life/Live| place = Paris | publisher = Musée d’Art Moderne| year = 1996|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Important historical artist-run initiatives include the [[North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=aa8bbd32-3c6c-4750-a70e-5ea1ac2d0524 "Museums and Galleries," Edmonton Journal, APRIL 18, 2008]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Iron-Bridge-Sculptors-Life-Peter/dp/1926710401 "Iron Bridge," Piri Halasz, November 5, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vueweekly.com/prairie_artsters_a_different_kind_of_arc/ "Prairie Artsters: A Different Kind of ARC," Amy Fung, Vue Weekly, July 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/31820594380/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-public "Profiles: Edmonton Art Institutions (Public Galleries)," PrairieSeen, SEPTEMBER 18, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001220358/http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/31820594380/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-public |date=October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies "Profiles: Edmonton Art Institutions (Societies, Foundations, Associations etc.)," PrairieSeen, JANUARY 24, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010092410/http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies |date=October 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada, [[The Wrong Gallery]] (using a disused doorway to display work) in [[New York City]] in the 2000s, and City Racing (an old [[bookmaker|betting shop]]) in London in the 1990s.{{cn|date=November 2014}} [[Damien Hirst]]'s one-off exhibition ''Freeze'' in a London warehouse in the 1990s could also be said to be a temporary, yet important, artist-run initiative.{{cn|date=November 2014}} Artist-run initiatives have used cars, briefcases, and other unusual exhibition venues where traditional spaces were too expensive or limited. Cuckoo is a [[New Zealand]]-based artist-run initiative where its members use other people's spaces to present their program, like a cuckoo bird does by placing its own eggs discreetly into the nests of other birds.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Artist-run initiatives also play a role in hosting international artists: they may also include guest studios or even international [[Artist in residence]] programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Bike Arc LLC''', located in downtown [[Palo Alto, California]], is a Silicon Valley startup that designs secure [[bicycle parking rack]]s and systems. It was founded by Joseph Bellomo and Jeff Selzer in 2008. Jeff Selzer sits on the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://bikesiliconvalley.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the General Manager of Palo Alto Bicycles. Joseph Bellomo, a [[California]]-licensed [[architect]], is the founder and owner of [[Joseph Bellomo Architects]], Inc. in Palo Alto, which he founded in 1986. In addition to collaborating on Bike Arc, Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer also worked together on the Palo Alto Bikestation at the [[Caltrain]] depot.

[[File:Umbrella Arc by Bike Arc in downtown Palo Alto, California..jpg|thumb|Umbrella Arc bicycle parking system/bike racks/bicycle storage by Bike Arc.]]

In 2009, the American Institute of Architects, California Council, gave Bike Arc the Honor Award for Small Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Honor Award for Small Projects|url=http://www.aiacc.org/2011/08/02/bike-arc/|publisher=AIACC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer—both being bicycle enthusiasts—set out to design bicycle-parking systems that don't touch and potentially damage bicycles, a solution that prevents bicycles from contacting each other, which can cause wear-and-tear.

== Products ==

Bike Arc is [[patented]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD604207}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the United States and in Europe (Office for Harmonization In the Internal Market), and the company offers multiple iterations of the same fundamental concept: a [[modular]] [[structure]] of [[steel]] arcs. The Bike Arc family includes the Rack Arc, the Half Arc, the Umbrella Arc, the Tube Arc, the Car Arc, the Bus Arc, the House Arc, and the Ad Arc.

All Bike Arc products are manufactured in the United States.

== Installations ==

The City of Palo Alto has purchased and installed multiple Bike Arc products, including numerous Rack Arcs, Half Arcs and Umbrella Arcs, and Bike Arcs are also in public spaces in Boston, Las Vegas, Redwood City, California, and Norfolk, Virginia. They have also been installed at the University of Buffalo and the University of Nebraska, as well as—among others—at Juniper Networks, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., and the Seattle Repertory Theater.

'''Capp Street Project''' was established as an experimental art space in 1983, at 65 Capp Street in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and was the first visual arts residency in the [[United States]] dedicated solely to the creation and presentation of new art installations and conceptual art.&lt;ref name="About CSP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About CSP - Capp Street Project Archive|url=http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/aboutcsp.html|publisher=California College of the Arts|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capp Street Project name and concept has existed since 1983, although the physical space which the residency and exhibition program occupied has changed several times. In 1998 Capp Street Project united with [[California College of the Arts]]’ [[Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts]].&lt;ref name="20th Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfand|first1=Glen|title=Capp Street Project: 20th Anniversary Exhibition|url=http://artforum.com/archive/id=4393|website=ArtForum|publisher=Artforum International Magazine|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Wattis celebrated 30 years of Capp Street Project Art.&lt;ref name="30 years"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garchik|first1=Leah|title=CCA marks 30 years of Capp Street Project art|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/sfsnap/2014/02/21/cca-marks-30-years-of-capp-street-project-art/|website=SFGATE|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1983, Capp Street Project was created by Ann Hatch who acquired a [[David Ireland (artist)|David Ireland]] designed house at 65 Capp Street in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/aboutcsp.html|title=About CSP|website=Capp Street Project Archive|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hatch's original intention was to preserve the house as a work of art, a personal inquiry concerning patronage and the desire to nurture non-traditional art making processes, ultimately led in another direction. The artist-in-residency program was created and became central to Capp Street Project.

Capp Street Project became part of the [[Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts]] which is in turn part of the [[California College of the Arts]] in 1998 and the house at 65 Capp Street returned to the public sector.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capp Street Project Archive|url = http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/index.html|website = libraries.cca.edu|access-date = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a program of Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts it is currently run by Anthony Huberman, the Director since 2013.&lt;ref name="Bliss"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bliss|first1 = Chris|title = Anthony Huberman Appointed Director of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts|url = https://www.cca.edu/news/2013/03/14/anthony-huberman-appointed-director-cca-wattis-institute-contemporary-arts|publisher = California College of the Arts|accessdate = 2016-02-03|date = 2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its inception, Capp Street Project has given more than 100 local, national, and international artists the opportunity to create new work through its residency and public exhibition programs.

== Artists ==

=== Some past Capp Street Artists and their projects ===
Glen Seator, 1997. Seator's Approach was a full-scale indoor re-creation of the street and sidewalk outside Capp Street Project and of the street-facing facade of the gallery's first floor. Writing in the summer 1997 issue of ArtNews, critic Kenneth Baker called Seator's installation "one of the great gallery shows in this city's history." Seator's large-scale architectural installations have won international acclaim.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], 1989. In Privation and Excesses, Hamilton used 700,000 pennies, among other materials, to create a poetic exploration of systems and mediums of exchange. The installation was featured on the cover of Artforum, a career-making event for the artist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/anc_r89a001.pdf|title = Ann Hamilton, Capp Street Project|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = CCA Libraries|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Viola]], 1989. Viola's installation Sanctuary combined video, earth, and redwood trees to create an urban refuge. A renowned video artist, Viola was also awarded a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship in 1989.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Diller Scofidio + Renfro|Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio]], 1987. In the Drawing Room: versions and subversions, the collaborators—who also have an architectural practice—explored themes of domesticity, architecture, the home, and the body of the imagined resident of the installation.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Border Arts Workshop|Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo (BAW/TAF)]], was a San Diego-based art collective included artists; [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], Emily Hicks, Bertha Jottar, Richard Lou, [[Victor Ochoa]], Robert Sanchez, Michael Schnorr and Rocío Weiss. In their 1989 exhibition ''Border Axes'' they created a communications network with modern equipment including fax machines, Xerox machines, an 800 phone line, and video equipment in hopes of dissolving the borders between the US and Mexico with alternative ways of communicating and collecting news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Border Lines: The Border Arts Workshop Goes High Tech|url = http://www.robertatkins.net/beta/witness/artists/formats/border.html|website = Robert Atkins|access-date = 2016-02-05|publisher = Village Voice News|date = 1989-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Loopy includes a built-in thermal color [[Computer printer|printer]] that can be used to create [[sticker]]s from game screenshots. An optional accessory, called {{nihongo|''Magical Shop''|マジカルショップ|Majikaru Shoppu}}, is a video capture device to obtain images from [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] and [[DVD player]]s. Users may add text to these images and make stickers. Including Magical Shop's own built-in software, the Loopy game library contains 11 titles. The Loopy features one controller port for use with a standard [[game controller]] or with a mouse (sold separately). Developer [[Kenji Terada]] worked on ''Loopy Town no Oheya ga Hoshii!''.

Casio dropped the support of the console in 1996, only one year after its release.

'''Citationality''', in [[literary theory]], is an author's [[citation]] (quoting) of other authors' works.  Some works are highly citational (making frequent use of numerous allusion to and quotations from other works), while others seem to exist in a vacuum, without explicit references to other authors or texts.  Some writers, such as the Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], are highly citational (Borges frequently included citations and footnotes in his stories, many of which were entirely made up). Citationality is often seen as a typical feature of [[postmodernism]], especially in its pop culture manifestations (consider how frequently a television show like [[The Simpsons]] or [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]] makes use of quotes and citations).

==Iterability==

In [[critical theory]], citationality sometimes refers to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s notion of iterability from his essay "Signature Event Context",&lt;ref&gt;See Derrida, ''Limited Inc'', edited by Gerald Graff (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1988), 18: "And if one maintains that ordinary language, or the ordinary circumstances of language, exclude a general citationality or iterability ...".&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that the essential feature of a signature was that it had a recognizable form and could be repeated.  As soon as a signature has a recognizable and repeatable form, however, it can also be copied or counterfeited.  In other words, although a signature is supposed to testify to the presence of an authentic original intention, it simultaneously sets up the possibility of an inauthentic copy.

Derrida's concept—which he denies ''is'' a concept simply because from the moment that the concept enters the game, it has become motivated—emerges from his engagement with [[J. L. Austin]]'s problematic claim that a "nonserious" performative utterance, as uttered in a play or a poem, say, is "parasitic" upon the true performative and cannot be considered legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;See Austin, ''How To Do Things With Words'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962): 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as Austin put it, if an actor playing a minister in a play says to two actors playing a bride and groom, "I now pronounce you husband and wife," the actors are not thereby married. As Derrida recognizes, this is not only a non-problem—the ''actors'' are not thereby married, obviously, but the ''characters'' are—but the very nature of citing, reiterating, reusing a phrase, reperforming a performative utterance is at the heart of the communicative function of language.

[[Judith Butler]] would later take up this same notion and apply it to [[gender theory]], arguing that gender is essentially a performance, a citation of all previous performances of gender—rather than testifying to an innate and natural character of a person (as masculine or feminine), gender testifies to the possibility of inauthentic or parodic citations of gender (as, for example, in a drag performance).&lt;ref&gt;See Butler, ''Gender Trouble'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colorfulness''', '''chroma''' and '''saturation''' are attributes of perceived color relating to chromatic intensity. As defined formally by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) they respectively describe three different aspects of chromatic intensity, but the terms are often used loosely and interchangeably in contexts where these aspects are not clearly distinguished.

'''Colorfulness''' is the "attribute of a visual perception according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/233|title=colourfulness {{!}} eilv|website=eilv.cie.co.at|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806140347/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/233|archivedate=2017-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|last=Fairchild|first=Mark|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2013}}, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A note accompanying this definition in effect implies that the perception of colorfulness evoked by an object depends not only on its spectral [[reflectance]] but also on the strength of the illumination, and increases with the latter unless the [[brightness]] is very high.

'''Chroma''' is the "colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/139|title=CIE e-ILV 17-139|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214923/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/139|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A note accompanying this definition in effect implies that an object with a given spectral [[reflectance]] exhibits approximately constant chroma for all levels of illumination, unless the brightness is very high. Thus if a uniformly colored object is unevenly lit, it will generally exhibit greater colorfulness where it is most strongly lit, but will be perceived to have the same chroma over its entire surface. While colorfulness is an attribute of the color of the light reflected from different parts of the object, chroma is an attribute of the color seen as belonging to the object itself (called an object color&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/831|title=CIE e-ILV 17-831|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410215355/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/831|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;),and describes how different from a grey of the same lightness such an object color appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/015.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour|website=www.huevaluechroma.com|access-date=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330104913/http://www.huevaluechroma.com/015.php|archivedate=2017-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the chroma and lightness of an object are its colorfulness and brightness judged in proportion to the same thing ("the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting"), the saturation of the light coming from that object is in effect the chroma of the object judged in proportion to its lightness. On a [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] hue page, lines of uniform saturation thus tend to radiate from near the black point, while lines of uniform chroma are vertical.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As colorfulness, chroma and saturation are defined as attributes of perception they can not be physically measured as such, but they can be quantified in relation to psychometric scales intended to be perceptually even, for example the chroma scales of the Munsell system.

== Saturation ==
The saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and how much it is distributed across the spectrum of different wavelengths. The purest (most saturated) color is achieved by using just one wavelength at a high intensity, such as in laser light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} If the intensity drops, then as a result the saturation drops.  To desaturate a color of given intensity in a [[subtractive color|subtractive]] system (such as [[watercolor]]), one can add white, black, [[grey|gray]], or the hue's [[complementary color|complement]].

Various correlates of saturation follow.

; CIELUV and CIELAB

In [[CIELUV]], saturation is equal to the ''chroma'' normalized by the ''lightness'':

:&lt;math&gt;s_{uv}=\frac{C^*_{uv}}{L^*}=13 \sqrt{(u'-u'_n)^2+(v'-v'_n)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nobr|(''u''′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the chromaticity of the white point, and chroma is defined below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schanda|first=János|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8VDAgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Colorimetry+intitle:Understanding+intitle:the+intitle:CIE+intitle:System|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117120237/https://books.google.com/books?id=g8VDAgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Colorimetry+intitle:Understanding+intitle:the+intitle:CIE+intitle:System|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

By analogy, in [[CIELAB]] this would yield:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{ab}=\frac{C^*_{ab}}{L^*}=\frac{\sqrt{{a^*}^2+{b^*}^2}}{L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

The CIE has not formally recommended this equation since CIELAB has no chromaticity diagram, and this definition therefore lacks direct connection with older concepts of saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22correlate+of+saturation%22+cielab+chroma+lightness+chromaticity|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=Focal Press|editor=Leslie D. Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia|isbn=0-240-51417-3|year=1993|page=124|first=Robert William Gainer|last=Hunt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117125004/https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22correlate+of+saturation%22+cielab+chroma+lightness+chromaticity|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this equation provides a reasonable predictor of saturation, and demonstrates that adjusting the lightness in CIELAB while holding {{nobr|(''a''*, ''b''*)}} fixed does affect the saturation.

But the following formula is in agreement with the human perception of saturation:
The formula proposed by Eva Lübbe is in agreement with the verbal definition of Manfred Richter: Saturation is the proportion of pure chromatic color in the total color sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lübbe|first=Eva|title=Colours in the Mind - Colour Systems in Reality- A formula for colour saturation|publisher=[Book on Demand]|year=2010|isbn=978-3-7881-4057-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{ab}=\frac{C^*_{ab}}{\sqrt{{C^*_{ab} }^2+{L^*}^2}} 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; is the saturation, ''L''* the  lightness and ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chroma of the color.

; CIECAM02

In [[CIECAM02]], saturation equals the square root of the ''colorfulness'' divided by the ''brightness'':

:&lt;math&gt;s=\sqrt{M/Q}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is inspired by experimental work done with the intention of remedying [[CIECAM97s]]'s poor performance.&lt;ref name=ciecam02&gt;{{cite conference|conference=The CIECAM02 Color Appearance Model|title=IS&amp;T/SID Tenth Color Imaging Conference|last=Moroney|first=Nathan|author2=Fairchild, Mark D. |author3=Hunt, Robert W.G. |author4=Li, Changjun |author5=Luo, M.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Magnitude estimation for scaling saturation|first=Lu-Yin G.|last=Juan|author2=Luo, Ming R.|conference-url=http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG004421000001000575000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes| work=[[Proceedings of SPIE]]|volume=4421|conference=9th Congress of the International Colour Association|editors=Robert Chung, Allan Rodrigues|date=June 2002|pages=575–578|doi=10.1117/12.464511}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M'' is proportional to the chroma ''C'' ({{nobr|1=''M'' = ''CF''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0.25&lt;/sup&gt;}}), thus the CIECAM02 definition bears some similarity to the CIELUV definition. An important difference is that the CIECAM02 model accounts for the viewing conditions through the parameter ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=ciecam02/&gt;
; HSL and HSV

Saturation is also one of three coordinates in the [[HSL and HSV]] [[color space]]s. However, in the HSL color space saturation exists independently of lightness. I.e. both a very light color ''and'' a very dark color can be heavily saturated in HSL; whereas in the previous definitions&amp;mdash;as well as in the HSV color space&amp;mdash;colors approaching white all feature low saturation.

== Excitation purity ==

[[Image:Excitation Purity.svg|300px|thumb|right|'''Excitation purity''' is the relative distance from the white point. Contours of constant purity can be found by shrinking the spectral locus about the white point. The points along the line segment have the same hue, with p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; increasing from 0 to 1 between the white point and position on the [[Spectral colors|spectral locus]] (position of the color on the horseshoe shape in the diagram) or (as at the saturated end of the line shown in the diagram) position on the [[line of purples]].]]

The '''excitation purity''' (purity for short) of a stimulus is the difference from the illuminant's [[white point]] to the furthest point on the chromaticity diagram with the same hue ([[dominant wavelength]] for [[monochromatic]] sources); using the [[CIE 1931 color space]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-240-51417-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22excitation+purity%22|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|first=Leslie D.|last=Stroebel|author2=Zakia, Richard D.|page=121|year=1993|edition=3E|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117050517/https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22excitation+purity%22|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_e = \sqrt{\frac{(x - x_n)^2 + (y - y_n)^2}{(x_I - x_n)^2 + (y_I - y_n)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nobr|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the chromaticity of the white point and {{nobr|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the point on the perimeter whose line segment to the white point contains the chromaticity of the stimulus. Different color spaces, such as CIELAB or CIELUV may be used, and will yield different results.

== Chroma in CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces ==

{{See also|Psychophysics}}

The naïve definition of saturation does not specify its response function. In the CIE XYZ and RGB color spaces, the saturation is defined in terms of additive color mixing, and has the property of being proportional to any scaling centered at white or the white point illuminant. However, both color spaces are nonlinear in terms of psychovisually perceived [[color difference]]s. It is also possible—and sometimes desirable—to define a saturation-like quantity that is linearized in term of the psychovisual perception.

In the [[Lab color space|CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces]], the unnormalized '''chroma''' is the radial component of the cylindrical coordinate [[HCL color space|CIE L*C*h]] (lightness, chroma, hue) representation of the L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces, also denoted as CIE L*C*h(a*b*){{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} or CIE L*C*h for short, and CIE L*C*h(u*v*). The transformation of {{nobr|(''a''*, ''b''*)}} to {{nobr|(''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^* = \sqrt{a^{*2} + b^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_{ab} = \arctan \frac{b^{*}}{a^{*}}&lt;/math&gt;

and analogously for CIE L*C*h(u*v*).

The chroma in the CIE L*C*h(a*b*) and CIE L*C*h(u*v*) coordinates has the advantage of being more psychovisually linear, yet they are non-linear in terms of linear component color mixing. And therefore, chroma in CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces is very much different from the traditional sense of "saturation".

===Chroma in color appearance models===

Another, psychovisually even more accurate, but also more complex method to obtain or specify the saturation is to use a [[color appearance model]]. Here, the '''chroma''' color appearance parameter might (depending on the color appearance model) be intertwined with e.g. the physical brightness of the illumination or the characteristics of the emitting/reflecting surface, which is more sensible psychovisually.

'''Croatian art of the 20th century''', that is [[visual arts]] within the boundaries of today's Croatia, can be divided into [[modern art]] up to the [[Second World War]], and [[contemporary art]] afterwards.

Modern art in Croatia began with the [[Secession (art)|Secession]] ideas spreading from [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]], and [[post-Impressionism]] from Paris. Young artists would study the latest trends and integrate them into their own work. Many strove to bring a native cultural identity into their art, for example themes of national history and legends, and some of the artwork following the [[First World War]] contained a strong political message against the ruling [[Austro-Hungarian]] state. A change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] were evident. In the 1920s, the [[Croatian art of the 20th century#Earth Group|Earth Group]] sought to reflect reality and social issues in their art, a movement that also saw the development of [[Hlebine School|naive art]]. By the 1930s there was a return to more simple, classical styles.

Following the [[Second World War]], artists everywhere were searching for meaning and identity, leading to [[abstract expressionism]] in the U.S. and art [[informel]] in Europe. In the new Yugoslavia, the communist [[socialist realism]] style never took hold, but [[bauhaus]] ideas led to [[geometric abstraction]] in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. In the 1960s, non-conventional forms of visual expression took hold along with a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards new media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focusing more on the artists' process. Art of the 1970s was more conceptual, [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionist]]. However, the 1980s brought a return to more traditional painting and images.

==Modern Art==

The term [[Modern Art]] in [[Europe]] covers roughly the period from the 1860s to the [[Second World War]], and denotes a move away from [[academic art]] with its [[classical mythology]] themes and stylised landscapes. In Croatia, the change was marked by the Croatia salon (''Hrvatski salon'') exhibit of 1898 in the new [[Art Pavilion in Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="lexicon-moderna"/&gt; One of the prime movers of that exhibition, and in the construction of the Art Pavilion itself was the artist [[Vlaho Bukovac]]. Together with [[Bela Čikoš Sesija]], [[Oton Iveković]], [[Ivan Tišov]], [[Robert Frangeš-Mihanović]], [[Rudolf Valdec]] and [[Robert Auer]] he established a breakaway Croatian Society of Artists, who were to become known as the Zagreb Colourful School (''Zagrebačka šarena škola'').&lt;ref name="kucabukovac"/&gt;

This set the scene in the beginning years of the 20th century, for young Croatian artists studying in [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]], bringing back the ideas  of the new [[Secession (art)|Secessionist]] movements.&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; [[Impressionism]] and [[post-Impressionism]] ideas spreading from [[Paris]] would also influence the new generation of artists. In [[sculpture]] and in [[painting]], new ideas of individual artistic expression were taking hold, leading to a new direction of [[Art of Croatia|art in Croatia]].&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

The [[Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb|Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb]] was established in 1907, teaching a new generation of Croatian artists modern techniques and ideas.&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

===Munich Circle===
[[File:1910, Miroslav Kraljevic, Autoportret sa psom, ulje, 110x85,5, Moderna galerija Zagreb.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Miroslav Kraljević self-portrait with dog]]
Munich Circle (''Münchenski krug'') is the term given by art historians to a group of Croatian painters at the beginning of the 20th century at the start of Croatian Modernism. The painters were [[Josip Račić]], [[Miroslav Kraljević]], [[Vladimir Becić]], and [[Oskar Herman]]. Together they attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]], and were at the time known by their classmates as "''Die Kroatische Schule''" (The Croatian School). Račić and Herman had previously studied with [[Anton Ažbe]] at his famous private school in [[Munich]], who insisted on studying the model, plasticity and drawing clear, clean volumes.&lt;ref name="msu-mo"/&gt; The Munich painters achieved strong tonal forms in their work by studying the classical painting of Spanish and French masters. Their joint identity of style, with concise artistic expression, without literary, historical or moralistic framework, puts them in direct contact with French [[impressionism]], particularly with [[Manet]] and [[Cézanne]] as role models. Each of them separately has influenced Croatian Modernism, and together they form an important category in Croatian art. The term "Munich Circle" was coined in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="msu-mo"/&gt;

===Medulić Society===
[[File:Ivo Kerdić Matko.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The work of Ivo Kerdić in Mirogoj cemetery, Zagreb]]
In 1908, a breakaway group of young [[Dalmatia]]n artists in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], founded the Medulić Society. Led by the artist [[Emanuel Vidović]],&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt; they  used themes from national legends, poetry and history in their art. Exhibitions were held in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (1908), [[Ljubljana]] (1909), [[Zagreb]] (1910), Rome (1911),&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt; [[Belgrade]] (1912) and Split (1919).&lt;ref name="lexicon-medulic"/&gt; The Medulić group had an ideological orientation and an underlying political message. Its aim was not simply to develop a national artistic style, but rather to increase political awareness of the south Slavic identity, and promote the idea of independence from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt;

The Medulić Society's best known representative was the sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]], who by then was already receiving international recognition for his work. Within Croatia, his best known work includes the powerful “[[Well of Life (sculpture)|Well of Life]]”, and statues of [[Grgur Ninski]], and Bishop [[Strossmayer]]. Other sculptors in the group include [[Toma Rosandić]], [[Ivo Kerdić]] (best known for medallions),&lt;ref name="kerdic"/&gt; and [[Branislav Dešković]] (known for animal sculptures). Painters in the group included [[Mirko Rački]] best known for his powerful illustrations of [[Dante]] and his posters, [[Tomislav Krizman]]&lt;ref name="lexicon-krizman"/&gt; and [[Jerolim Miše]].&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt;

Two strong images from the time are "The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy" by [[Mirko Rački]] (1916) and "Black Flag" by [[Ljubo Babić]] (1919), both portraying the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian state. Rački used the secessionist decorative style in a powerful statement: a soldier stands to attention against an empty grey field, while behind him sways a black and yellow snake (the colours of the Austrian flag). In Babic's painting, the subject is the funeral of [[Emperor Francis Joseph]] portrayed with a large elongated black flag hanging like a guillotine over a company of people dressed in gay, sumptuous colours.&lt;ref name="culturenet-early20thc"/&gt;

===Spring Salon===
During 1916-28, the Spring salon exhibits in Zagreb brought together painters, sculptures and graphical artists.&lt;ref name="lexicon-proljetnisalon"/&gt; At the first exhibit in the Ulrich Gallery (1916), artists included [[Ljubo Babić]], [[Jerolim Miše]], [[Tomislav Krizman]], [[Zlatko Šulentić]], and sculptors [[Ferdo Ćus]], [[Hinko Juhn]] and [[Joza Turkalj]]. During the [[First World War]], many artists went abroad, and the salon became the only organized art-related activity at the time. The paintings exhibited showed strong use of form, and restricted colour palettes. The move to flatter forms, in the manner of [[Cézanne]], came in the 1919 Spring Salon exhibition,&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; with the next generation of artists such as the Prague Four (''Praška četvorka'') [[Vilko Gecan]], [[Milivoj Uzelac]], [[Marijan Trepše]],&lt;ref name="trepse"/&gt; and [[Vladimir Varlaj]]. [[Expressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[secession (art)|secession]]ism ideas spread,&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and new directions also came from [[Đuro Tiljak]] who had studied with [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]],&lt;ref name="posta-tiljak"/&gt; while [[Marino Tartaglia]] bought back the ideas of the [[Futurists]] from [[Rome]] and [[Florence]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; By the 1920s, elements of [[neoclassicism]] were creeping in, with its simpler forms.

===Zenit===
The incoming ideas from the rest of Europe were balanced by artists who wanted to integrate the new artistic directions with their native cultural identity. The journal Zenit (Zenith), was an [[avant-garde]] review of new arts and culture that played a key role in this movement.&lt;ref name="jstor-artjournal49-1"/&gt; Founded in 1921 by the poet and critic [[Ljubomir Micić]], despite criticism and controversy, Zenit continued for 6 years to promote the cause for international modernism consistent with a Yugoslav cultural identity.&lt;ref name="jstor-artjournal49-1"/&gt;

One of contributors to Zenit was the architect and artist [[Josip Seissel]], who under the pseudonym of [[Jo Klek]] is considered to be the first in Croatia (1922) to produce [[abstract art|abstract]] paintings: geometric collages with linguistic motifs and [[Surrealist]] compositions.&lt;ref name="joklek"/&gt;

=== 1930s Classicism and Expressionism ===
By the 1930s, the sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]], whose work was by then well-known internationally, moved into [[Classicism]] and encouraged a new "Mediterranean tradition" in his students' art.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic" /&gt;
Other artists of time were [[Sergej Glumac]] and [[Vinko Foretić]]&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic" /&gt; Sculptor [[Frano Kršinić]] created motifs of motherhood and music in marble, while [[Marin Studin]] created large works in wood, bronze and stone.&lt;ref name="mvpei" /&gt; [[Cubist]] influences can be found in works of [[Vlado Gecan]], [[Sonja Kovačević Taljević]], and [[surrealism]] in the works of [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Vanja Radauš]], and [[Anto Motika]]. On the island of [[Brač]], [[Ignjat Job]] painted colourful landscapes in a personal  [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] style.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Naïve Art ==
[[Naïve art|Naïve]], or [[primitive art]] is a distinct segment of the art of the 20th century. In Croatia, naïve art was at first connected with the works of peasants and working men, ordinary men and women, of whom the most successful, over the course of time, became professional artists. Naïve art assumes the work of artists who are more or less self-taught, painters and sculptors with no formal art training, but who have achieved their own creative style and a high level of art. An identifiably individual style and poetic nature distinguishes the Naïve from other "amateur" painters and sculptors, and from the general self-taught artist. The view of a Naïve artist will usually display unusual proportions and perspective, and certain illogicalities of form and space. Such characteristics are the expression of a free creative imagination, in a similar way to other 20th-century art movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]].

In Croatia, Naïve art is also seen as a democratic movement, as the movement proves anyone can create worthwhile art regardless of formal training. Within these art forms various the emotive qualities of works are often more visible than any reigning form of logic or reason. Common themes include: "the joy of life," "forgotten nature," "lost childhood," and "wonder at the world." However, Naïve art does not only reflect positive aspects of life, and dark and tragic themes can also be found within the genre.

Naïve art first appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 1930s when the [[Zagreb Art Pavilion]] showcased an exhibition of the artists' association entitled Country (''Zemlja'') on 13 September 1931. Of the artists exhibited, two particularly stood out: [[Ivan Generalić]], who showed three drawings and nine watercolors, and [[Franjo Mraz]], who exhibited three watercolors. The artists sought to show that talent does not only reside in certain social classes or privilege and started the association with naïve art and paintings of villages or by artists from the countryside rather than cities. Themes in Croatian naïve art branched out in the 1950s from villages to "personal classics," which included architectural monuments and objects and opened a period known as "modern primitive art."&lt;ref&gt;Crnkovic, Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth Group===
[[File:Antun Augustinčić Vajda.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Sculpture by Antun Augustinčić in Mirogoj cemetery, Zagreb]]
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

===Hlebine School===
The Hlebine School is the term applied to a group of [[naive art|naive]] painters working in or around the village of [[Hlebine]], near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. The school developed from the encouragement given by [[Krsto Hegedušić]] to the young painter [[Ivan Generalić]], whom he met in 1930. Generalić and his friends  [[Franjo Mraz]] (also a native of Hlebine) and  [[Mirko Virius]] (from the nearby village of [[Đelekovec]]) formed the nucleus of the group.&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; In 1931, they were invited to exhibit with the Earth group, which brought public recognition&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and naive art became a popular form of artistic expression in Croatia, making a strong social statement about the harshness of rural life.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt; Generalić was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref name="hmnu-vodic"/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt; Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son [[Josip Generalić]].&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; By the 1950s the school had become well-known internationally, and showed their work at leading exhibitions such as the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="hlebine"/&gt; The [[Croatian Museum of Naive Art]] in Zagreb has a comprehensive display of the works of the Hlebine School and other naive artists.&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].&lt;ref name="hmnu"/&gt;

==Contemporary Art==
[[File:Edo Murtić Šeferov.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Mosaic by Edo Murtic at Mirogoj, Zagreb]]
During the Second World War, many artists left the country, while others joined the partisans and worked on applied art such as posters and prints supporting the war effort. In the years immediately following the war, the new communist regime in Yugoslavia brought in the Soviet model of [[socialist realism]] and refusal to participate in exhibitions became a popular means of resistance among artists.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; However, after [[Tito–Stalin split|Tito's break with Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1948 there was a return to more artistic freedom.

Identifying the characteristics of [[contemporary art|contemporary]] or [[postmodern art]] within Croatia can be hard to specify. Some common features are geometrizing and symbolic-metaphoric paintings, sculptures and installations. Some of the best known contemporary artists are painters [[Julije Knifer]], [[Edo Murtić]], [[Oton Gliha]], and sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

===EXAT 51===
EXAT 51 (the name stands for ''Experimental Atelier'') was a group of artists and architects (1951–56) whose program was [[geometric abstraction]] in painting, new ways of handling of space in architecture, and  the abolition of the distinction between fine and applied arts.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; Their ideas owed much to the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] [[avant-garde]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] experience, and Exat wanted to involve artists in the shaping of the environment with an experimental and creative approach.&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt; Members of the group included architects [[Bernardo Bernardi]], [[Zdravko Bregovac]], [[Zvonimir Radić]], [[Božidar Rašica]], [[Vjenceslav Richter]], [[Vladimir Zarahović]], and painters [[Vlado Kristl]], [[Ivan Picelj]], [[Božidar Rašica]], and [[Aleksandar Srnec]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Exat's first manifesto in 1951 was fiercely attacked by the traditional art establishment. However, an exhibit of paintings by the group in 1952 in Zagreb was well attended, and in that same year, they participated in the VII [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]] in Paris. In 1953, an exhibition of paintings was held in the Society of Croatian Architects and there the group issued a second manifesto in response to their critics. Other exhibits followed in Belgrade (1953), Rijeka (1954,1956), Dubrovnik (1956) and finally in Belgrade (1956).&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt; Under their influence, Croatian artists moved to more creative and personal forms of expression, to [[surrealism]] and [[lyrical abstraction]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

EXAT 51 was instrumental in setting up the [[Zagreb Triennial]] of Applied Arts, and in establishing a Studio for Industrial Design in 1955. The forerunner of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]] was founded in 1954 as a direct result of their efforts.&lt;ref name="msu-exat51"/&gt;

===Gorgona Group===
[[File:A.G. Matos (Zagreb).jpg|thumb|175px|Statue of the writer A.G. Matos by [[Ivan Kožarić]], Zagreb, 1978]]
[[Gorgona Group|Gorgona]] was a group of artists active in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966, that advocated non-conventional forms of visual art expression. It included the painters [[Josip Vaništa]], [[Julije Knifer]],  [[Marijan Jevšovar]], [[Đuro Seder]], sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]], art theoreticians and critics [[Radoslav Putar]], [[Matko Meštrović]], [[Dimitrije Bašičević]] (Mangelos), and architect Miljenko Horvat. Individually they were significant representatives of their own artistic fields, and together they had a major impact on the direction of contemporary art in Croatia.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msu-gorgona"/&gt; Besides working in more traditional techniques, they pioneered radical forms of artistic expression related to [[existentialism]], neo-[[dadaism]] and proto-[[conceptualism]]. Their anti-magazine Gorgona (11 issues published 1961-1966) was simply designed, each edition intended to showcase the work and views of a single artist and was in itself a printed work of art.&lt;ref name="kontakt-gorgona"/&gt; The group was preoccupied by the absurd, sent people invitations  for events that never took place, placed ads for the sale of trivial objects, planned unfeasible projects, and even went so far as to exclude the audience to have the whole place for themselves.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; The Gorgona publication, and the group's activities raised interest in international art circles - and they had frequent contact with such artists as [[Dieter Roth]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="msu-gorgona"/&gt;

===New Tendencies===
[[File:Julije Knifer Meandar 1961-1962.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Meandar by Julije Knifer]]
During the period 1961-1973, five international exhibitions were organized under the title New Tendencies. They continued the  development of ideas raised by Exat 51 during the 1950s, and formed part of the broader European post-[[informel]] art movement in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt; They were the initiative of art historians and critics [[Dimitrije Bašičević]], [[Božo Bek]], [[Boris Kelemen]], [[Radoslav Putar]], [[Matko Meštrović]] and the artists [[Ivan Picelj]], [[Vjenceslav Richter]], [[Julije Knifer]], [[Aleksandar Srnec]],  later by a group of younger artists: [[Juraj Dobrović]], [[Miroslav Šutej]], [[Mladen Galić]], [[Ljerka Šibenik]] and [[Ante Kuduz]].&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

The exhibitions focused mainly on neo-[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], presenting artistic achievements in a wide variety of media, such as [[computer graphics]], [[conceptual art]], [[performance art]]&lt;ref name="mvpei"/&gt; and [[environmental art]], as well as an examination of the theory and practice of connecting art with society. The exhibitions were held in a number of museums and galleries across Zagreb presenting the latest work from internationally known artists.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

At the first exhibition in 1961, a common theme was the investigation of the relationship between structure and surface, and the beginnings of programmed and [[kinetic art]], a topic that was to be developed further in the following exhibition of 1963. Experiments in visual perception gave a scientific dimension, and by the third exhibition in 1965, artists were examining the relations between cybernetics and art, and events included a symposium on the topic. The 1968/69 exhibition and colloquium dealt further with ideas of information theory and aesthetics, called "Computers &amp; Visual Research". Two new sections appeared at the  exhibition of 1973 - one on conceptual art, and another entitled "Canvas". There was also a symposium on "The Rational and the Irrational in Contemporary Art". A 6th New Tendencies exhibition was planned, but never took place. An international symposium was held in 1978, along with an exhibit reviewing the artistic changes of 1966-1978.&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt;

Among the most significant works are the sculptures of [[Vojin Bakić]], the reliefs, paintings and graphic books of [[Juraj Dobrović]], and the paintings, sculptures, and mobile graphics of [[Miroslav Šutej]].&lt;ref name="msu-newtendencies"/&gt;

===New Media===
Between the years 1966 and 1974, the visual arts scene in Croatia expanded, as in the rest of the world, to include [[new media art]].&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; [[Minimal art]], [[Pop-art]] and the geometric forms of New Tendencies combined in a new generation of artists characterized by the free spirit of 1968 and ideas about changing the world. They used mass media as a means to express their individual observations and views. Within Croatia, the movement was known as "new art practice",&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; stressing the importance of the artist's part in the process. The very notion of art was called into question, along with its function. Analyzing the concepts of culture, society, politics and economics led to new media as forms of expression such as [[photography]], [[video art|video]], [[performance art]], spatial interventions, and [[installation art]]. The works were most frequently [[conceptual art|conceptual]] or [[environmental art|environmental]], and emphasis shifted from aesthetic to ethical principles.&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt; By the mid-seventies disillusionment had set in, groups broke up, and some artists left the country.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

Among the artists who made most impression in the "new art practice" with individual exhibitions or group actions and urban interventions were [[Željko Borčić]], [[Boris Bućan]], [[Vlasta Delimar]], [[Slavomir Drinković]], [[Braco Dimitrijević]], [[Ladislav Galeta]], [[Tomislav Gotovac]], [[Sanja Iveković]], [[Dean Jokanović]], [[Jagoda Kaloper]], [[Željko Kipke]], [[Dalibor Martinis]], [[Marijan Molnar]], [[Goran Petercol]], [[Ante Rašić]], [[Josip Stošić]], [[Davor Tomičić]], [[Goran Trbuljak]], [[Gorki Žuvela]], the Group of Six Artists ([[Vlado Martek]], [[Željko Jerman]], [[Boris Demur]], [[Mladen Stilinović]], [[Sven Stilinović]], [[Fedor Vučemilović]]), and the Group Flow ([[Vladimir Gudac]], [[Dubravko Budić]], [[Davor Lončarić]], [[Ivan Šimunović]], [[Gustav Zechel]], [[Darko Zubčević]]).&lt;ref name="msu-nap"/&gt;

===Biafra Group===
Biafra (1970–1978) was a group of Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and cultural conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from [[pop-art]] and [[minimalism]] to new figuration.&lt;ref name="kultura-biafra"/&gt; The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The content of their art was [[expressionist]], clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors [[Branko Bunić]], [[Stjepan Gračan]], [[Ratko Petrić]] and [[Miro Vuco]]. Membership expanded over the years to include [[Ivan Lesiak]], [[Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač]], [[Rudolf Labaš]], [[Vlado Jakelić]], [[Stanko Jančić]], [[Ratko Janjić-Jobo]], [[Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin]], [[Emil Robert Tanay]].&lt;ref name="kultura-biafra"/&gt;

===New Image===
At the Art Pavilion in 1981, the Youth Salon showed the work of 12 young painters who presented a return to painting and images. The trend became known as New Image (''Nova Slika''), and it was also evident at the Gallery of Contemporary Art's exhibition of 'Italian Trans-Avantgarde', showing the works of Italian and Yugoslav artists. New image brought new ways of expression and a new sensitivity towards intimacy and symbolism.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; The traces of new image can be found in the late 1970s in Zagreb, and in major exhibitions in New York, London, the [[Venice Biennale]] (1980), the Biennale of young people in Paris 1980. Individual artists: [[Nina Ivančić]], [[Star Fio]], [[Đuro Seder]]

===1980s and Beyond===
[[File:Đuro Seder - Unutarnji razgovor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Inner Dialogue (''Unutarnji razgovor'') by Đuro Seder, 1991]]
The 1980s brought a rejection of  restrictions, and more varied individual approaches to art and explorations of painting and sculpture appeared.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt; Some concentrated on the meaning and content of the work, while for others the narrative was more important and in conceptual art the medium increasingly defined the work. The [[avant-garde]] trends of the previous decades were giving way to a reintroduction of  more traditional media in a more personal style, but at the same time, there was a more refined sense of conceptualism - leading to more materialized forms.

Several of the older Croatian artists had already turned again towards painting and more traditional media during the 1970s. For example, the work of [[Ferdinand Kulmer]] and [[Đuro Seder]] brought significant changes to Croatian painting, and the sculptor [[Ivan Kožarić]] reviewed his work in relation to his artistic past. At the same time [[Dimitrije Bašičević]] organized the "Confrontations" exhibition which juxtaposed avant-garde and traditional approaches to art and compared their value and significance.&lt;ref name="ican-matecevic"/&gt;

The 1990s was again a time of war, as Croatia gained its independence from the former Yugoslavia. [[Edo Murtić]]'s "War" cycle stands as powerful, poignant statement,&lt;ref name="min-kulture"/&gt; while his large scale paintings of near abstract landscapes, such as his "Montraker" cycle of the 1990s point the way to the future.

In a '''cumulative tale''', sometimes also called a '''chain tale''', action or dialogue repeats and builds up in some way as the tale progresses. With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ashliman|first= D.L.|authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|editor= Donald. Haase|encyclopedia= The Greenwood encyclopedia of folktales and fairy tales |title=Chain Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC|publisher= Greenwood Press|isbn= 978-0-313-33441-2|page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in "[[The Gingerbread Man]]."   The device often takes the form of a [[cumulative song]] or [[nursery rhyme]]. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.

==History==
Cumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish [[Midrash]], considered to date from the sixth century AD, [[Abraham]] is brought before King [[Nimrod]], who commands him to worship fire.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Nimrod#Text of the Midrash Raba version|Text of the Midrash Raba version]]. This is not itself a cumulative tale, though many cumulative tales seem to echo its theme.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that "man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house" ([[Genesis Rabba]] xxxviii).

There is a similar tale, [[The Mouse Turned into a Maid]], in the [[Panchatantra]], in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese [[The Husband of the Rat's Daughter]], are widely diffused.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2031c.html The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun: fables of Aarne-Thompson type 2031C]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson]] classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html D. L. Ashliman's page of story types]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">In the field of [[patent]]s, the phrase "to '''design around'''" means to invent an alternative to a patented [[invention]] that does not infringe the patent’s [[Claim (patent)|claim]]s.  The phrase can also refer to the invention itself.

Design-arounds are considered to be one of the benefits of patent law.  By providing monopoly rights to inventors in exchange for disclosing how to make and use their inventions, others are given both the information and incentive to invent competitive alternatives that design around the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/katherine_strandburg/4 |last=Strandburg |first=Katherine |year=2004 |title=What Does the Public Get?: Experimental Use and the Patent Bargain |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |volume=2004 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[vaccine]]s, for example, design-arounds are considered fairly easy.  It is often possible to use the original patent as a guide for developing an alternative that does not infringe the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nc33ZS5nRa0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;ots=N1uqRKKYJd&amp;sig=lJPt-TOjqdtnPvbXYN2JzQNeoCs#PPA91,M1 |last=Kremer |first=Michael |chapter=Creating Markets for New Vaccines –Part II: Design Issues |title=Innovation Policy and the Economy |volume=I |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=0-262-60041-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design-arounds can be a defense against [[patent troll]]s.  The amount of license fee that a patent troll can demand is limited by the alternative of the cost of designing around the troll's patent(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=991698 |last=Golden |first=John M. |title='Patent Trolls' and Patent Remedies |journal=[[Texas Law Review]] |volume=85 |issue= |pages=2111–2161 [p. 2130] |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to defend against design-arounds, inventors often develop a large [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of interlocking patents, sometimes called a [[patent thicket]].  Thus a competitor will have to design around a large number of patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubinfeld |first=Daniel L. |last2=Maness |first2=Robert |year=2005 |chapter=The Strategic Use of Patents: Implications for Antitrust |title=Antitrust, Patents and Copyright: EU and US Perspectives |editor1-last=Leveque |editor1-first=Francois |editor2-last=Shelanski |editor2-first=Howard |location=Northampton |publisher=Edward Elgar |pages=85–102 |chapterurl=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Profile/publications/Strategic_Use_of_Patents.pdf |isbn=1-84542-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Faith Fyles was born September 30, 1875, in [[Cowansville]], [[Quebec]], Canada. She was the seventh of ten children.&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt; Her father, Reverend Dr. Thomas Fyles, was an [[England|English]] Anglican clergyman who emigrated to Canada from [[England]] to establish parishes and studied and illustrated insects ([[entomology]]) as a hobby.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;

Faith Fyles graduated from high school with honours, entering [[McGill University]] on a first-class scholarship and graduated with a BA degree in 1905. She studied under Professor [[Carrie Derick]] — another exceptional woman botanist who no doubt inspired Fyles to pursue a career in the field.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"&gt;Faith Fyles: Botanist and artist at the [[Central Experimental Farm]], in The Beechwood Way, Volume 9, Issue 33 Spring 2014, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, she spent a year studying the flora of Québec with her father and took art classes. Fyles then taught school for six years (at Dunham Ladies College, Dunham and then at [[Bishop Strachan School]], [[Toronto]]&lt;ref name="WomenBotanists"&gt;Amber Loydlangston, "Women in Botany and the Canadian Federal Department of Agriculture," Scientia Canadiensis 29, 2 (2006): 99–130&lt;/ref&gt;), which was followed by a year travelling and studying in Europe.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;

Like her father, Faith was an active member of the [[Canadian Field-Naturalist|Ottawa Field Naturalists Club]], serving on its committees and councils and contributing articles to its publications and other journals.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt;

==Career==

In 1909, when her family moved to [[Hull, Quebec]]&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt; Fyles obtained a clerk’s position in the [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|Department of Agriculture]] in Ottawa as an assistant seed analyst. (Note: this position was considered women’s work. According to G. H. Clark, "men do not take to the detail work of seed testing. It is very fine and close work, very trying on the patience. It is essentially women’s work."&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt;)

Two years later, she was transferred to the Botany Division at the [[Central Experimental Farm]] as an assistant botanist, where she was put in charge of the Arboretum.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt; While qualified for the position, it was rare at the time for government to hire women as professionals in botany, and there is conjecture that her appointment may have resulted from her father’s connections, from the influence of one of her former professors who was a public service examiner in botany, or from the fact that she was 36 years old and the "likelihood of her leaving the position in favour of marriage and a family was not high."&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenBotanists"/&gt;

As assistant [[botanist]] Fyles labelled the trees, shrubs and [[herbaceous]] [[perennials]] in the [[Arboretum]] &lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt; and was responsible for identifying the large number of plants sent to, or collected by, the division.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt; She also offered to draw botanical specimens in her spare time.&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt;

On July 11, 1914, Faith left Ottawa to tour western Canada collecting weeds. Upwards of 800 perfect specimens of weeds representing 44 different species were collected, pressed, dried and shipped to Ottawa.&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenBotanists"/&gt; On that trip and another in November 1914 to [[Shediac, New Brunswick]] where she sampled ergot on wild rice, she showed initiative by also collecting flowering and leafy botanical specimens of edible, indigenous plant species such as edible [[blueberries]] and [[huckleberries]] that still are preserved in the two herbarium of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.&lt;ref name="MycologicalHerbarium"&gt;Dr. Scott Redhead, Curator, Canadian National Mycological Herbarium (pers. comm., February 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Her first sole authored publication was in 1914 where she was accredited with the ‘Systematic Botany’ chapter in the Report of the Dominion Botanist for 1913. Fyles later also prepared a bulletin, Principal Poisonous Plants of Canada, which was illustrated with her own paintings and sketches.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt; Additional publications ([[Wild Rice]] Bulletin, 1920; and the expansion of the herbarium came from her work in the Department.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], Fyles (Fyles, 1915) conducted research on a fungal disease of wild rice called [[ergot]] and realized that the wild rice [[fungus]] was a new [[species]]. She formally described it scientifically in her wild rice bulletin in 1920 following the war (Fyles, 1920a). That year she also published her bulletin (Fyles, 1920b) on poisonous plants that also mentions the wild rice ergot now known as ''[[Claviceps zizaniae]]'' (Fyles) Pantidou ex Redhead, M. E. Corlett &amp; M. N. L. Lefebvre (Redhead et al 2008).

Additionally in 1920, Fyles became the first artist employed by the Horticulture division, where she worked under William Tyrrell Macoun.&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt; Her paintings were intended to provide illustration of true colour and technical data of individual specimens.&lt;ref name="PearonCanvas"&gt;Pear on Canvas: Natural Histories of Women in Botany http://www.activehistoryexhibits.ca/exhibits/show/science-technology-and-gender/life-on-canvas--hidden-histori&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially important in terms of experimenting with and documenting different varieties of fruit, vegetation and seeds.&lt;ref name="PearonCanvas"/&gt; Her watercolours illustrate publications such as Cultivation of the [[Apple]] in Canada and The [[Raspberry]] and its Cultivation in Canada.&lt;ref name="BotArtist"/&gt; Fyles assisted with the fight against the wheat rust epidemic of 1916 by beautifully illustrating in colour the disease, both microscopically and symptomatically on both [[wheat]] and [[barberry]] for a March 1917 widely distributed poster and pamphlet, "Black or [[stem rust|Stem-Rust]] of [[Wheat]]". She was indirectly mentioned as the artist for the poster by the Minister of Agriculture in his report and the original water colour is housed in the [[National Mycological Herbarium]] for Canada.&lt;ref name="MycologicalHerbarium"/&gt;

In 1931, poor health forced her retirement, but she continued painting in oils, pastels and watercolours.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt; For two decades she had entered her work in [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] exhibitions that expressed an appreciation of nature’s beauty, especially that of plants and flowers.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt; She also held her own exhibitions, such as one in Ottawa in 1924 where 17 of her 36 pictures on display were sold, including one to [[Evelyn Byng, Viscountess Byng of Vimy|Lady Byng]], wife of the [[Governor General of Canada]] who later had Fyles paint scenes from her garden.&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt;

Faith Fyles died in Ottawa in 1961 and is buried with her parents in section 40 of [[Beechwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="BeechwoodCemetary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeechwoodWay"/&gt; She was clearly proud of her university education as is evident from her grave stone that reads, "Faith Fyles B.A."

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

A '''flashback''' (sometimes called an '''analepsis''') is an interjected [[scene (fiction)|scene]] that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the [[Plot (narrative)|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pavis, Shantz | year= 1998 | title = Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis | publisher = University of Toronto Press | page = 151 | isbn= 0802081630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story's primary sequence of events to fill in crucial [[backstory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenny | year = 2004 | title = Teaching Tv Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy | publisher = Libraries Unltd Incorporated | page = 163 | isbn= 1591581990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, a [[flashforward]] (or prolepsis) reveals events that will occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward|title=flash-forward|author=|date=|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story, develop a character, or add structure to the narrative. In literature, '''internal analepsis''' is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; '''external analepsis''' is a flashback to a time before the narrative started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jung | year = 2010 | title = Narrating Violence in Post-9/11 Action Cinema: Terrorist Narratives, Cinematic Narration, and Referentiality | publisher = VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | page = 67 | isbn= 3531926020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to "resolve an enigma".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are important in [[film noir]] and [[melodrama]] films. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; In movies and television, several camera techniques, editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward; for example, the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred, photography may be jarring or choppy, or unusual coloration or sepia tone, or [[monochrome]] when most of the story is in full color, may be used. The scene may fade or dissolve, often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice-over by a narrator (who is often, but not always, the character who is experiencing the memory).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Literature===
An early example of analepsis is in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where the main story is narrated through a [[frame story]] set at a later time. Another ancient example occurs in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the tale of Odysseus' wanderings is told in flashback by Odysseus to a listener. Another early use of this device in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale. The story begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are also employed in several other ''Arabian Nights'' tales such as "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The City of Brass]]".

Analepsis was used extensively by author [[Ford Madox Ford]], and by poet, author, historian and mythologist [[Robert Graves]]. The 1927 book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster. Analepsis is also used in ''[[Night (novel)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]]. If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order, one can say that these form the present of the story, while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards. If flashbacks are presented in non-chronological order, the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous: An example of such an occurrence is in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' where the narrative jumps back and forth in time, so there is no actual present time line. ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' is a story about voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] to [[India]] and back. The narration starts when they were arriving [[Africa]] but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Lusíadas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series employs a magical device called a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]], which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters, which are thus able to provide commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|title=Pensieve Flashback - TV Tropes|author=|date=|website=tvtropes.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027011816/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The creator of the flashback technique in cinema was ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d’un crime]]'' directed by [[Ferdinand Zecca]] in 1901. &lt;ref&gt;Turim, Maureen. ''Flashbacks in Film: Memory &amp; History By Maureen Turim''. p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1931 film ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'', but were rare until about 1939 when, in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' as in [[Emily Brontë]]'s original novel, the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr. Lockwood, who has witnessed Heathcliff's frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost. More famously, also in 1939, [[Marcel Carné]]'s movie ''[[Le Jour Se Lève]]'' is told almost entirely through flashback: the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel. While the murderer, played by [[Jean Gabin]], is surrounded by the police, several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the movie.

One of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). The protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, dies at the beginning, uttering the word ''Rosebud''. The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter's interviewing Kane's friends and associates, in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane. As the interviews proceed, pieces of Kane's life unfold in flashback, but Welles' use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by [[William K. Howard]]'s ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Hitchcock used a flashback in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1956) to reveal the enigma that led to psychological disturbances for the female lead; as with Welles' film, he delayed the flashback until the end of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory, flashbacks can also act as an [[unreliable narrator]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' from 1950 notoriously featured a flashback that did not tell the truth but dramatized a lie from a witness. The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in [[Errol Morris]]'s 1988 documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 ''[[Rashomon]]'' does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies.

Sometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted. The 1956 film version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film. This was done because the plot of ''Carousel'' was then considered unusually strong for a film musical. In film version of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967), according to [[Alan Jay Lerner]], a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near-comedy to tragedy.

In [[Billy Wilder]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of both flashback and [[flashforward]] is the first scene of ''[[La Jetée]]'' (1962). As we learn a few minutes later, what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past, since the present of the film's [[diegesis]] is a time directly following [[World War III]]. However, as we learn at the very end of the film, that scene also doubles as a prolepsis, since the dying man the boy is seeing is, in fact, himself. In other words, he is proleptically seeing his own death. We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene.

Occasionally, a story may contain a flashback within a flashback, with the earliest known example appearing in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''[[L'Atlantide (1921 film)|L'Atlantide]]''. ''[[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|Little Annie Rooney]]'' (1925) contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry, with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen.  In [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), the main action of the film is told in flashback, with the scene of Liberty Valance's murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback. Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the 1968 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''Lone Wolf Isazo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lone Stalker A.K.A. Lone Wolf Isazo|publisher=[[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]]|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|accessdate=2011-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061943/http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', where almost the entire film (set in 1870) is told as a flashback from 1919 (in [[black-and-white]]) and contains other flashbacks; for example, Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show. An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, as in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', ''[[Passage to Marseille]]'', and ''[[The Locket]]''. This technique is a hallmark of [[Kannada]] movie director [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] whose futuristic flick ''[[Super (2010 Indian film)|Super]]'' (2010) is set in 2030 and contains multiple flashbacks ranging from 2010 to 2015 depicting a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian]] India.

[[Satyajit Ray]] experimented with flashbacks in ''[[Pratidwandi|The Adversary]]'' (Pratidwandi, 1972), pioneering the technique of [[Negative (photography)|photo-negative]] flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Light: Satyajit Ray From the Apu Trilogy to the Calcutta Trilogy|author=Nick Pinkerton|date=14 April 2009|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|accessdate=2009-07-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625154630/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|archivedate=25 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]] makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films.  In ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992), for example, scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character's backstory and motivation additional context.  In ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), which uses a highly [[nonlinear storytelling|nonlinear]] narrative, traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled "The Gold Watch".  Other films, such as his two-part ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (Part I 2003, Part II 2004), also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks.

===Television===
The television series [[Quantico (TV series)]], ''[[Kung Fu (TV series) | Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]],'' and ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' use flashbacks in every episode. Flashbacks were also a predominant feature of the television shows ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.  Many detective shows routinely use flashback in the last act to reveal the culprit's plot, e.g. ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Banacek]],'' ''[[Columbo]].''

'''''Flatliners''''' is a 1990 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], produced by [[Michael Douglas]] and Rick Bieber, and written by Peter Filardi.  It stars [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[William Baldwin]], [[Oliver Platt]], and [[Kevin Bacon]]. The film is about five medical students who attempt to find out what lies [[Afterlife|beyond death]] by conducting clandestine experiments that produce [[near-death experience]]s. The film was shot on the campus of [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] (Chicago) between October 1989 and January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/flatliners/details|title=Flatliners - Sony Movie Channel|website=www.sonymoviechannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] in 1990 ([[Charles L. Campbell]] and [[Richard C. Franklin]]). The film was theatrically released on August 10, 1990, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $61 million at the box office. 

A [[Flatliners (2017 film)|remake]] directed by Danish filmmaker [[Niels Arden Oplev]], was released in September 2017, and also featured Kiefer Sutherland in a starring role (albeit a different role).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Nelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims “today is a good day to die”. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates—Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Randy Steckle, and Rachel Manus—to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While "dead", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.

Joe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. David is third to flatline, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically beat up by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by his home videos of his sexual dalliances with other women. David finds Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her. 

Rachel decides to flatline next on Halloween. David tries to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already "dead" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies for good after the power goes out, and the men are unable to shock her with the [[defibrillator]] paddles. Luckily, she survives, but she, too, is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.

The three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fiancée, Anne, comes to his apartment, and she breaks up with him after she discovers his videos. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him. 

David goes to visit Winnie Hicks, now grown up, and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. Then, David finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is attempting for a third time to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town.

Rachel seeks comfort in the arms of David, and the two spend the night together. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. Nelson storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.

David leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom, and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter, and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to heroin. Then, Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his stupid plan.

The three men race to Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, "Today wasn't a good day to die."

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James wrote, "when taken on its own stylish terms, ''Flatliners'' is greatly entertaining. Viewers are likely to go along with this film instantly or else ridicule it to death. Its atmospheric approach doesn't admit much middle ground."&lt;ref&gt;James, Caryn.

But Ebert criticized ''Flatliners'' for "plot manipulation that is unworthy of the brilliance of its theme. I only wish it had been restructured so we didn't need to go through the same crisis so many times."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.

It's a movie about daring that dares nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "D" rating and [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote, "What isn't in evidence is the sort of overheated lunacy that made the [[William Hurt]] speed-freak trip movie ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980) such delectable trash. ''Flatliners'' is [[campy|camp]], but of a very low order. Schumacher is too intent on pandering to the youth market to take the mad risks and plunges that make for a scintillating bad movie."&lt;ref&gt;Gleiberman, Owen.

[[File:Frank-desprez.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Desprez in 1913]]
'''Frank Desprez''' (9 February 1853 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1916) was an English playwright, essayist, and poet. He wrote more than twenty pieces for the theatre, as well as numerous shorter works, including his famous poem, ''Lasca''.

==Life and career==
Desprez was born in [[Bristol]], England, the eldest of the eleven children of Charles Desprez, a jeweller and silversmith. The family was of French descent. He was educated at Cosham School, [[Wiltshire]] and spent three years in his teens in the U.S. State of Texas. In 1883, Desprez married Jessie Louisa Potter Macqueen. They had a son and two daughters.

===Librettist and assistant to Richard D'Oyly Carte===
Desprez returned to Britain in 1875. His first piece written for the theatre shortly thereafter was an adaptation of ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]''.  When this piece went on the road in 1876, he also wrote a companion piece for it called ''Happy Hampstead'', which was set to music by the theatrical agent and composer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  Desprez became a close friend of Carte's and worked with him for many years as Carte's secretary.

At the same time Desprez wrote the texts for ten short works for D'Oyly Carte, most of which accompanied the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas on the bills at the [[Opera Comique]] and later the [[Savoy Theatre]]. These pieces had long runs in tandem with, and sometimes beyond, the runs of the principal pieces, and they were usually played on tour throughout Britain as companion pieces, benefit pieces and short-programme items. Working with composers such as [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Edward Solomon]], Desprez became perhaps the most popular librettist of one-act operas in Britain.

[[File:Bee-bee l.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', 1891]]
Desprez's most frequently played work was his 1879 two-act [[musical theatre|musical play]], ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'', which was later played in the British provinces by the Majilton company more than a thousand times.  It was written as a vehicle for the music hall star [[Kate Santley]].  W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] for 20 years, also played in the piece.  The story concerns an unusual marriage custom purportedly to be found "in out of the way parts of the world" such as Tibet.  The customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands.  The reviewer from ''The Era'' did not find the piece "refined" enough for his taste.

Desprez's best work as a lyricist was ''[[The Nautch Girl]], or, The Rajah of Chutneypore'', which played at the Savoy Theatre in 1891-92.

===Poet, essayist, journalist, and editor===
Desprez' best-known work, however, is a poem, ''Lasca'', about a Mexican girl and her cowboy sweetheart caught in a cattle stampede "in Texas down by the Rio Grande." The ballad-like poem, first published in a London magazine in 1882, has often been reprinted, usually with deletions and changes, and recited in many parts of the English-speaking world. Between 1873 and 1882 at least four other of Desprez's poems had been published, two of which are about Texas.

In 1884, Desprez began writing for ''The Era'', London's foremost theatre paper, and he became its editor in 1893, a position he held until illness forced him to retire in 1913. Desprez also wrote dozens of essays on travel, art, music, and famous personalities that were published in English periodicals, most of them between 1905 and 1914.

Desprez died in London at the age of 63.

'''Hassan Jangju''' ({{lang-fa|حسن جنگجو}}; 1967–1984) was an Iranian [[Basij]]i during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] who became subject to an [[List of iconic photographs|iconic photograph]] taken by [[Alfred Yaghobzadeh]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Spencer|title=Hassan "Jangju", boy soldier of the Iran-Iraq war, laid to rest at last|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hassan-jangju-boy-soldier-of-the-iran-iraq-war-laid-to-rest-at-last-fb7t5zdmv|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was missed in action in 1984, and his body was returned to Iran in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://iranwire.com/en/features/4817|title=Revolutionary Guards Deny Using Child Soldiers|date=14 September 2017|access-date=31 October 2017|work=IranWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shot ==
In the photo, Jangju is crawling through muddy ground of the marshes in south of Iran while he is holding a rifle in ready state.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The photograph became viral and was published in several media outlet both due to the special style of the soldier and it also attracted a lot of attention since the family name of the boy, "Jangju" meaning Warrior in Persian language was a good fit for the picture.&lt;ref name="Pars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran, dopo 37 anni trovato il corpo di un soldato|url=http://parstoday.com/it/news/iran-i112875-iran_dopo_37_anni_trovato_il_corpo_di_un_soldato|website=Pars Today|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=it-IT|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Yaghobzadeh]] was working for the Gamma and Associated Press news agencies at the time of capturing the famous photograph. The same photo used as a propaganda for recruiting volunteers by Iranian authorities during war time and afterwards.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Background ==
Jangju was a volunteer [[Basij]]i.&lt;ref name="Pars" /&gt; He was killed in February 1984 during [[Operation Kheibar]], part of the Battle of the Marshes, when Iran sent soldiers back over the Iraqi border, before they too became bogged down north of Basra.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Funeral and aftermath ==
The remains of his body was discovered and identified in the former Iran-Iraq war zone and sent back to Tabriz after 34 years on September 5, 2017. On September 6, 2017 the coffin of Hassan Jangju, which was draped in the Iranian flag, was borne through the streets by a huge crowd and laid to rest with full military honours. The ceremony for condolences to the Jangju's family was led by [[Ali Larijani]], speaker of the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مراسم تشییع پیکر شهید تازه شناسایی شده"حسن جنگجو" برگزار شد+تصاویر|url=http://tn.ai/1512409 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مادر شهید جنگجو در روز تشییع پسرش دار فانی را وداع گفت|url=http://tn.ai/1512402 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours after the funeral, his mother Jeyran Pourali died.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; Jangju's family described how the mother would lay out his clothes on a chair at the dinner table every evening, resembling his presence at home. One of his sisters explained: "My mother always believed that she had given her child in the service of God, and therefore was calm, but she always looked forward to his return."&lt;ref name="SNN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SNN.IR|first1=خبرگزاری دانشجو |title=مادر شهید حسن جنگجو به فرزند شهیدش پیوست|url=http://snn.ir/631901|website=خبرگزاری دانشجو {{!}} SNN.IR|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa-IR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum District is served by four stops on the [[METRORail]], one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from [[Interstate 69|I-69]]/[[U.S. Route 59|US 59]], [[Texas State Highway 288|State Highway 288]] and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.

The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter.  Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.

The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world.

==History==
In the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.

The Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]], at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core.    In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the [[United States of America|United States]] without [[zoning]], this was fairly progressive.

The Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between [[Allen Parkway]], [[Buffalo Bayou]] and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Boulevard Saint-Germain|St. Germain]] in [[Paris]], and [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]].

Since its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events
	
The Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.

==Funding==
Originally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members’ donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.

Today, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cachh.org |title=cachh.org |publisher=cachh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonendowment.org |title=Houston Endowment |publisher=Houston Endowment |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John P.

==Public issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.
The HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.

One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children's Museum of Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theater, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.

==Parking==
Parking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theater is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfah.org/visit/parking/|title=Parking and Transportation Options - The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|author=|date=|website=www.mfah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houmuse.org/visitor-information/transportation/|title=Transportation|author=|date=|website=houmuse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Empty Frames at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The frame which once held ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]''|alt=An empty frame hanging on a wall, between several portraits]]

On March 18, 1990, 13 works of art valued at a combined total of $500 million were [[art theft|stolen]] from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in [[Boston]]. In the early hours, guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the thieves tied up the guards and over the next hour committed the largest-value recorded theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to the art's recovery, but in 2017 this was temporarily doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set to the end of the year. This was extended into 2018 following helpful tips from the public.

The stolen works had originally been purchased by art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] (1840–1924) and intended to be left on permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was left untouched. Among the stolen works was ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'', one of only 34 known works by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting, valued at over $200 million.{{when|At the time of the theft, or when since?|date=March 2018}} Also missing is ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'', [[Rembrandt]]'s only known [[seascape]]. Other works by Rembrandt, [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Govaert Flinck|Flinck]] were also stolen.

According to the FBI, the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in [[Philadelphia]] during the early 2000s. They believe the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the  [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]. They also claim to have targeted two suspects, although they have not been publicly identified and are now deceased. Boston gangster [[Robert Donati|Bobby Donati]], murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars, has been cited as a possible collaborator in the heist. Significant evidence suggests that [[Hartford, Connecticut]] gangster Robert Gentile knows the location of the works, although he denies involvement.

==Robbery==
Around midnight on Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red [[Dodge Daytona]] pulled up near the side entrance of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt; Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least an hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a [[Saint Patrick's Day]] party nearby.&lt;ref name=abathstory&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |title=Decades after the Gardner heist, police focus on guard |first=Stephen |last=Kurkjian |work=Boston Globe |date=March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928031507/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later at around 1{{nbsp}}a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with a fellow guard, the only other person in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt;

[[File:ISGardnerMuseum.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum|Gardner Museum]] in 2008|alt=refer to caption]]

At 1:24{{nbsp}}a.m., one of the two men outside pushed the buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a disturbance in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.&lt;ref name=insider&gt;{{cite news|date=May 2009 |first=Milton |last=Esterow |title=Inside the Gardner Case |url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |work=ArtNews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225044341/http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the museum was equipped with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Self-Portrait'' (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting off the wall and  attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' out of the frame, as well as ''[[A Lady and Gentleman in Black]]''.  They also removed [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' and [[Govaert Flinck]]'s ''[[Landscape with Obelisk]]'' from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze [[Gu (vessel)|gu]] from the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

Elsewhere in the museum, they stole five [[Degas]] drawings and an eagle [[finial]]. The finial sat at the top of a [[Napoleon]]ic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt; [[Manet]]'s ''[[Chez Tortoni]]'' was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27{{nbsp}}a.m. and again at 12:53{{nbsp}}a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them "You'll be hearing from us in about a year," although they were never heard from again.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15{{nbsp}}a.m. later that morning.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

==Stolen artwork==
Altogether, thirteen pieces were stolen at an estimated loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest recorded private property theft in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |title=Hot Canvases: A new book shatters myths about art theft |first=David |last=Menconi |work=Harvard Magazine |date=March–April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322000716/http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return.&lt;ref name=McShane&gt;{{cite book |last= McShane |first= Thomas |title= Stolen Masterpiece Tracker |year= 2006 |publisher= Barricade Books |isbn=978-1-56980-314-1 |first2= Dary |last2= Matera |chapter= 18.

==Investigation==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] took control of the case on the grounds that the artwork would likely cross state lines.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; They have conducted hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving [[Scotland Yard]], [[Japan]]ese and [[France|French]] authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The FBI believes the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]], and that the stolen paintings were moved through [[Connecticut]] and the [[Philadelphia]] area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= FBI Says It Has Clues in '90 Boston Art Heist |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/fbi-says-it-has-clues-in-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0 |work= The New York Times |accessdate= March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbipress1&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |title=FBI Provides New Information Regarding the 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Art Heist: Information Sought from Those in Philadelphia and Connecticut Who May Have Knowledge of the Art's Location |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division |first=Greg |last=Comcowich |date=March 18, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710143612/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |archivedate=July 10, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI stated it believed it knew the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased.

[[File:Sketches of Suspects Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Theft.jpg|thumb|right|Sketches of the suspects|alt=refer to caption]]
No single motive or pattern has emerged through the thousands of pages of evidence gathered.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available.&lt;ref name=McShane /&gt; The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two [[Raphael]]s and a [[Botticelli]] painting.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', which is one of the museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the paintings from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the [[Irish Republican Army]] in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states [[Whitey Bulger]] was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

The museum first offered a [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of $1 million, but that was later increased to $5 million in 1997.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;  The reward is for "information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition",&lt;ref name=fbipress1 /&gt; which remains on offer more than a quarter-century later.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; In May 2017, the bounty was doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set for midnight on December 31 of that year.&lt;ref name="10million"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner Museum staff|title=Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum : Gardner Museum doubles reward to $10 million for return of stolen art|url=http://www.gardnermuseum.org/resources/theft/reward_doubled|website=www.gardnermuseum.org|accessdate=May 26, 2017|language=en|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |title=Gardner Museum Doubles Reward for Recovery of Stolen Masterpieces |last=Bowley |first=Graham |date=May 23, 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 24, 2017 |issn=0362-4331 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524073316/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |archivedate=May 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/15/million-reward-for-stolen-gardner-museum-artwork-set-expire-end/3PD4IlwNU26FKpo4hLUCzK/story.html |title=$10m reward for stolen Gardner museum artwork set to expire at end of 2017 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reward was extended into 2018 following an outpouring of tips from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$10M Reward Extended For Return Of Stolen Gardner Museum Art|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/11/isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-heist-reward-extended/|website=CBS|accessdate=January 16, 2018|language=en|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities have stated they will not charge anyone who voluntarily turns in the artwork, but anyone caught knowingly in possession of stolen items could be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; The thieves cannot face charges because the five-year statute of limitations has expired.&lt;ref name=searchcont&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy |first1=Shelley |title=Search for artworks from Gardner heist continues 25 years later |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215221154/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |archivedate=February 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of DNA evidence===
In 2010, the FBI announced that some evidence from the original crime scene had been sent to the FBI's Laboratory in [[Quantico, Virginia]], for retesting with the hope of finding new [[DNA]] evidence to identify the culprits of the theft.

In June 2017, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that some of the crime scene evidence collected by the FBI was missing.  Even after an exhaustive search, they were unable to locate [[handcuffs]] and [[duct tape]] used to immobilize the museum's two security guards that could have contained traces of the thieves' DNA material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |last2=Kurkjian |first2=Stephen |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/12/evidence-gardner-museum-thefts-that-might-bear-dna-missing/bQgapZNs1FKlTczoAijqnJ/story.html |title=Evidence in Gardner Museum thefts that might bear DNA is missing |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the museum director Anne Hawley received a letter that promised the return of the pieces for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get ''The Boston Globe'' to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but nothing further was heard once law enforcement got involved.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

Late one night in 1997, ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reporter Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn]] by William Youngworth, a career criminal and associate of New England art thief Myles Connor Jr.,&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; to see what was purported to be ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit dealing with Youngworth after not making any progress.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; The painting has since disappeared.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

On August 6, 2015, police released a video from the night before the theft that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape: one remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New video shows possible dry run for Gardner Museum art Heist |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |website=boston.com |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125203802/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |archivedate=January 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Is America's greatest art heist about to be solved? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |website=The Guardian |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214212739/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |archivedate=February 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guards had previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; &amp;ndash; which is not to say they could not have been collaborators.

In December 2015 FBI agents searched  [[East Boston]]'s [[Suffolk Downs]] [[horse racing]] track, acting on a tip consistent with rumors among Suffolk Downs employees in the 1990s that the stolen art was there. Stables, parts of the grandstand closed since the early 1990s, and two safes (which had to be drilled open) were searched without result.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurkjian |first1=Stephen |title=Search of Suffolk Downs for Gardner Museum masterpieces came up empty |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231020612/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential perpetrators===
{{further|Robert Donati#Possible role in Gardner Museum theft}}

Boston [[gangster]] [[Bobby Donati]] may have been involved in the heist. New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr., in prison at the time of the robbery, has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; Donati worked under Boston crime boss [[Vincent M. Ferrara|Vincent Ferrara]], and visited him in prison in the early 1990s. When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he "buried the stuff" and would find a way to negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

[[Hartford, Connecticut]], gangster Robert "Bobby the Cook" Gentile has been suggested on multiple occasions as knowing the location of the Gardner works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt;&lt;ref name=courant /&gt; In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]], Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor with the help of his son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the [[black market]].&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art.  In 2015, Gentile submitted to a [[polygraph|lie detector]] test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful.&lt;ref name=courant&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney |first1=Edmund H. |title=Prosecutors Reveal More Evidence They Say Ties Robert Gentile To Gardner Museum Robbery |url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |website=courant.com |publisher=Hartford Courant |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082228/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago.&lt;ref name="wcvb2may"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |title=FBI searching mobster's home for stolen Gardner masterpieces |website=WCVB |access-date=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510215744/http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-sentencing-20170905-story.html|title=Feds Say Gentile's Feigning Mental Issues, But Gangster's Sentencing Postponed|last=MAHONY|first=EDMUND H.|work=courant.com|access-date=September 5, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the museum raised its bounty in 1997, Myles J. Connor Jr. said he could locate the missing artwork in exchange for [[legal immunity]]. Authorities rejected his offer. Connor now believes that the Gardner works have passed into other, unknown hands. "I was probably told, but I don't remember," he said, blaming a heart attack that affected his memory.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Louis Royce, another Boston area gangster, claims he is still owed 15% for devising the plan for two fake policemen to request access to the museum at night.&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly |first1=Sherryl |title=Possible leads in $500M Boston museum robbery in 1990 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903  |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=January 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213151704/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903 |archivedate=December 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high profile Gardner Museum theft has been referenced and parodied in many different works. It was the subject of the 2005 documentary ''Stolen'', which first appeared in a slightly different version on [[Court TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalfilmcircuit.com/stolen/pressbook_stolen.pdf |title=Stolen: Is it still a masterpiece if no one can find it? |first=Rebecca |last=Dreyfus |date=April 13, 2006 |work=Stolen pressbook |publisher=International Film Circuit |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045940/http://www.internationalfilmcircuit.com/stolen/pressbook_stolen.pdf |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more well-known paintings have been referenced in multiple TV shows, including ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' episode "The Courier" (and an allusion to the Gardner Museum heist itself in the episode "Greyson Blaise"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2013/10/starring_role_for_boston_on_new_hit_blacklist |title=Starring role for Boston on new hit Blacklist |first=Mark |last=Perigard |date=October 30, 2013 |publisher=Boston Herald |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126132327/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2013/10/starring_role_for_boston_on_new_hit_blacklist |archivedate=January 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[American History X-cellent]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2010/04/%E2%80%98simpsons%E2%80%99_cracks_case_gardner_heist |title='Simpsons' crack case of Gardner heist |date=April 13, 2010 |publisher=Boston Herald |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126120453/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2010/04/%E2%80%98simpsons%E2%80%99_cracks_case_gardner_heist |archivedate=January 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Drunk History]]'' episode "Boston",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uo66zq/drunk-history-art-heist---uncensored |title=Art Heist – Uncensored Drunk History Video Clip – Comedy Central |first=Mark |last=Perigard |date=July 30, 2013 |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=December 1, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104921/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uo66zq/drunk-history-art-heist---uncensored |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[American Greed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100000093 |title=American Greed – Unsolved $300 Million Art Heist |date=October 14, 2012 |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=December 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120206/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100000093 |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7950">'''Julia Kwan''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[screenwriter]], director, and occasional producer of her own short and feature films.  She has brought a keen sense of the Chinese-Canadian cultural experience to her films.  Several of the films were made in conjunction with the [[National Film Board of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;"Julia Kwan - NFB." National Film Board of Canada. Accessed October 23, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nfb.ca/explore-all-directors/julia-kwan/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her feature films include ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005), as well as the feature length [[Documentary film]] ''[[Everything Will Be]]'' (2014).

== Biography ==
Julia Kwan was raised in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] to [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant parents. These childhood experiences would be a strong influence on her feature film [[Eve and the Fire Horse|''Eve and'' ''the Fire Horse'' (2005)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Walker, Susan. "Canada's Sundance kid; Julia Kwan's film is festival's lone Canadian entry Story focuses on Chinese life in Vancouver." ''Toronto Star'', January 27, 2006.

== Career ==
Julia Kwan was a director resident at [[Norman Jewison]]'s [[Canadian Film Centre]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Holt, Jim. "Vancouver director Julia Kwan gets warm reception at snowy Sundance." ''Canadian Press Newswire'', January 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  After beginning her career writing and directing two short films, she made her feature ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005).  The film was well received, with [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] declaring it "a finely wrought period piece" and "an exceptional feature debut.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Ken. "Eve &amp; The Fire Horse." ''Variety Magazine'', October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;"   Forty percent of the dialogue in ''[[Eve and the Fire Horse]]'' (2005) is spoken in Kwan's native tongue&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Brendan. "The great wide north: Canadian filmmakers broaden their cinema's scope to tackle international issues." ''Variety Magazine'', September 12, 2005. Accessed November 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cantonese]].  The film deals with the issues that arise from the friction between traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs and those of [[Catholicism]] for nine year old Eve (Phoebe Kut) growing up in Vancouver.  The actress has appeared in three of Kwan's films.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The film is "a largely autobiographical tale (of Kwan herself) growing up as a child of immigrants in Vancouver".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She has worked in a diversity of both subjects and genres throughout her filmography. Her short film ''Surfacing'' (2015) had Canadian folk musician [[Sarah McLachlan]] for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;"Surfacing by Julia Kwan - NFB." National Film Board of Canada. Accessed October 24, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nfb.ca/film/surfacing/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the film, McLachlan tells anecdotes from both her childhood and professional career, in first person narration.   Kwan also made a foray into animation with her short film ''Blossom''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (2010).  This short [[Experimental film|experimental]] film showcases the changing of the seasons, as compared with the growth cycle of a child.   Kwan's feature film ''[[Everything Will Be]]'' (2014) was her exploration of the effects of [[gentrification]] in [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver Chinatown]].  In the film, she interviews neighbourhood occupants that represent both the past and the future of the rapidly gentrifying community.

The '''Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus''' or '''"Great" Ludovisi sarcophagus''' is an [[ancient Roman sarcophagus]] dating to around AD 250–260 from a tomb near the [[Porta Tiburtina]]. It is also known as the '''Via Tiburtina Sarcophagus''', though other sarcophagi have been found there. It is known for its densely populated, anti-[[classicism|classical]] composition of "writhing and highly emotive"&lt;ref name="Kleiner 272"&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'' (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010, enhanced ed.), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ancient Romans|Romans]] and [[Goths]], and is an example of the battle scenes favored in [[Roman art]] during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].&lt;ref name="Kleiner 272" /&gt; Discovered in 1621 and named for its first modern owner, [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], the sarcophagus is now displayed at the [[Palazzo Altemps]] in [[Rome]], part of the [[National Museum of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus is a late outlier in a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, the others all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Strong et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300052936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 03.JPG|thumb|Detail of the central figure, his forehead marked with an X]]
The sarcophagus measures 1.53m in height and is made from [[Proconnesian marble]], a [[List of artistic media|medium]] characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Van Keuren, Donatio Attanasio, John J. Hermann Jr., Norman Herz, and L. Peter Gromet, "Multimethod Analyses of Roman Sarcophagi at the Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome," in ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; It is decorated in a very [[high relief]] with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, but here the battle continues round both sides.

The lid of the sarcophagus depicts barbarian children handed over to a Roman general by men presumably their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannine Diddle Uzzi, "The Power of Parenthood in Official Roman Art," in ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Children were sometimes taken into Roman custody as pledges of peace, and might be reeducated as Romans. The lid, which was broken in 1945 while on display in [[Mainz]], also shows a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of a female figure.

The central figure of the tortuous composition on the front is a young Roman military commander on horseback, presumed to represent the deceased. His face is serene, and his arm is extended confidently in a "gesture which is difficult to interpret but seems to be one of farewell".&lt;ref name="Strong 257" /&gt; An X-mark on his forehead has been interpreted as the cross received by initiates into the [[Mithraic mysteries]] as a sign of the god Mithras' favor. The Mithraic religion was popular among Roman soldiers. The valor ''([[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]])'' shown by the horseman may represent real-life bravery on the battlefield, but the religious connotation of the X may suggest victory over death, a theme of mounted warriors in funerary art. The horseman probably represents the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Welch, "Roman Sculpture," in ''The Oxford History of Western Art'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 51; Linda Maria Gigante, "Funerary art," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure is sometimes identified as the younger son of the emperor [[Decius]], [[Hostilian]], who reigned briefly in the year 251. Decius and his older son, [[Herennius Etruscus|Herennius]], whom he had made his co-ruler, were killed [[Battle of Abritus|in battle]] against a federation of [[Scythians#Migration period|Scythians]] under the command of the [[Goths|Gothic]] king [[Cniva]]. They were the first [[Roman emperor]]s to die in battle at the hands of a foreign enemy. Despite the battle imagery, Hostilian himself died of plague.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome'' (Duncan Baird, 2005), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 21.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Roman wearing mail, and above him a ''[[cornicen]]'', a junior officer who communicated signals with the [[cornu (horn)|military horn]]]]
The sarcophagus contains many precise depictions of military details such as the ''[[Draco (military standard)|draco]]'' military standard and a detailed [[Mail (armour)|mail shirt]] of the longer length characteristic of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern and Karen R. Dixon, ''The Late Roman Army'' (Yale University Press, 1996), pp. 98, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and style==
The undercutting of the deep relief exhibits virtuosic and very time-consuming drill work that conveys chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. It differs from earlier battle scenes on sarcophagi in which more shallowly carved figures are less convoluted and intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, "Roman Sculpture", in ''The Oxford History of Western Art'', p. 41; Mackay, ''Ancient Rome'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  Describing it as "the finest of the third-century sarcophagi", art historian Donald Strong says:&lt;ref name="Strong 257"&gt;Donald Strong et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 257, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300052936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The faces are strikingly unclassical, and the technique of deep drilling is particularly obvious in the manes of the horses and the shaggy hair of the barbarians.  But the main difference [to the [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], a similar 2nd-century work] is in the symbolism.  The barbarians all seem frozen in the moment before disaster and death overwhelm them; their attitudes are highly theatrical but none the less immensely expressive... The main theme is no longer the glorification of military prowess but that of transcending the struggle, presumably conveying the notion of triumph over death ... The ugliness of pain and suffering is stressed by the dishevelled hair, the tormented eyes, the twisted mouth.}}

The carving is so deep that the forms are almost completely offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing no room to depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue all the way around the sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574 n7.jpg|thumb|Detail of a barbarian pierced by a lance,]]
From the time of the [[Antonine dynasty|reign of the Antonine emperors]], Roman art increasingly depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the [[Roman Empire]] was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to [[fall of the Roman Empire|the fall of the empire in the West]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 371; Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations", p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.

Differences in scale between the figures, though present, are far less marked than in the earlier Portonaccio sarcophagus, such that the general is only slightly larger than his troops or enemies. Nor is the general seen wearing a helmet or in actual combat, as in the earlier sarcophagi.&lt;ref name="Strong 257" /&gt;

'''Nabataean art''' is the art of the [[Nabataeans]] of North Arabia. They are known for finely-potted painted ceramics, which became dispersed among [[Greco-Roman world]], as well as contributions to sculpture and [[Nabataean architecture]]. Nabataean art is most well known for the archaeological sites in [[Petra]], specifically monuments such as [[Al Khazneh]] and [[Ad Deir]]. [[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|right|alt=[[Al Khazneh]] or The Treasury at Petra|[[Al Khazneh]] or The Treasury at Petra]]

==Ceramics==
[[File:Nabataean Pottery.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Examples of Nabataean Ceramics|Examples of Nabataean ceramics]]
Nabataean pottery is characterized by its thin walls and floral motifs. The exclusive use of floral patterns links back to Nabataean [[aniconism]] in their religious practices. The designs on the wares are generally painted on or pressed into the surface with stamps and rouletting wheels. To put a finish on the pieces, the makers burnished them or used a [[sintering]] process. Most of the wares are pinkish in color, much like the cliffs surrounding the city. This is because Nabataean potters used local clay bodies in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Khairy (Spring, 1983). ''Technical Aspects of Fine Nabataean Pottery''. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research. No. 250 pp. 17-40&lt;/ref&gt; Nabataean wares take many forms, and can be classified by their thickness, rim shape, bases, and decor.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Philip C. Hammond (1962). ''A Classification of Nabataean Fine Ware''. American Journal of Archaeology , Vol. 66, No. 2. pp. 169-180&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the forms of the vessels mimic the shape of metal wares from the region.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vickers (Apr., 1994). ''Nabataea, India, Gaul, and Carthage: Reflections on Hellenistic and Roman Gold Vessels and Red-Gloss Pottery''. American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 98, No. 2. pp. 231-248&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels would have been for daily use, not ceremonial, despite the unusually large amount of broken shards found in rubbish heaps.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Tombs===
Nabataean tombs are primarily "Rock-Cut tombs." They are created from cutting directly into the landscape, traditionally rock (see [[Rock-cut tombs in Israel]]). Rock-cut tombs are the most frequently found within excavated Nabataean archeological sites. There have been nearly 900 rock-cut tombs found in Petra and Hegra. Nabataean tombs are a fusion Hellenistic and Roman styles as well as a gradual creation of the [[Nabataean]] style. Some offer features of clear Greek influence, such as pediments, metope and triglyph entablatrures, and capitals. They were built to honor Gods and leaders as well as house generations of a specific family. Tombs are located normally inside the city. These tombs are simple in style but elaborated in function, often featuring steps, platforms, libation holes, cisterns, water channels and sometimes banqueting halls. Many feature numerous religious icons, inscriptions, and sanctuaries found in association with springs, catchment pools, and channels.&lt;ref name="Zeyad"&gt;Zeyad al-Salameen (2011). ''The Nabataeans and Aisa Minor''. Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry. Vol. 11, No. 2. 55-78.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Obelisk Tomb and Triclinium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Obelisk Tomb|Obelisk Tomb]]
Crenelated Tombs (see [[crenelation]]) are popular within Nabataean architecture. There are several variations of crenelation, wavering in number of tiers. Crenelated tombs were created in order to represent fortifications, creating a symbol of cities, strength, military power. Later, under Achaemenid Persians, the fortification context was removed, giving a greater scope to a sign of kingship and authority

Several tombs feature [[obelisks]] on their exterior. Obelisks are a narrow tapering monument, often used to represent the [[Nephesh]], specific leaders, and Gods of monolithic societies. They are often found in Near Eastern and Egyptian architecture.

Tombs with detailed [[facades]] are also quite popular in the Nabataean community. There are a total of eight different façade types: Single Pylon, Double Pylon, Step, Proto-Hegr, Hegr, Arch, Simple Classical and Complex Classical. Single Pylon, Double Pylon, Step, Proto-Hegr, and Hegr are characterized by variations on the crowstep motif, combined with elements from classical architecture. Arch, Simple Classical, and Complex Classical have only classical motifs, which have been given Nabataean interpretation.&lt;ref name="Zeyad"/&gt;

At [[Petra]], there is a series of tombs called the "Royal Tombs." These tombs are split into four sections: the Urn Tomb, the Silk Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb, and the Palace Tomb. The Urn Tomb is built high on the mountain side, and requires climbing up a number of flights of stairs. It has been suggested that this is the tomb of Nabataean King Malchus II who died in 70 AD. Beside it is the Silk Tomb, named from its rich color of the sandstone. The Corinthian Tomb is next, featuring Greek Corinthian columns. Finally the Palace Tomb with three distinct stories in its facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/royal.html |title=Petra: The Royal Tombs |publisher=Nabataea.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Camel and riders MET me31 67 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Nabataean]] sculpture, camel and riders. ca. 1st century B.C.]]
Early Nabataean sculpture had several characteristics of Roman, Greek, and Syrian sculpture. Wild hair, dramatic facial expressions, and S-curves mirrored the Hellenistic style of sculpture. Greek sculpture was represented with the long, tight beards, symmetry, and perfecting of the human body.&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"&gt;Zayadine, F. (2003). ''The Nabataean Gods and their Sanctuaries''. Petra Rediscovered: Lost City of the Nabataeans. G. Markoe. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc.: 57-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In later years, Nabataean sculpture later became very stylized. Certain elements, such as hair, were kept in the Greco-Roman style, but lots of other things evolved into what’s now understood to be Nabatataean. These characteristics are found in facial structures. The eyes of several pieces are depicted with characteristically flat, cartoonish, semicircular eyes. The same pieces often have triangular noses and large, round chins. Beyond human forms, Nabataean sculpture has come in the form of animals such as birds, elephants, and camels.&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"/&gt;

A number of different Gods and Goddesses are commonly represented throughout Nabataean sculpture. The majority are Gods and Goddesses that were worshiped by the Nabataeans, however some are representative of Greek, Roman, and Middle Eastern beliefs. In addition, the Zodiacs are periodically represented throughout their many art forms. [[Dushara]] was a principal male deity of the Nabataeans. He has been compared to Zeus in Greek culture as well as [[Dionysus]]. Examples of Dushara have been found in several places in Petra as well as [[Khirbet Et-Tannur]].&lt;ref name="Zeyadine"/&gt; Initially and traditionally, Dushara was represented in an aniconic form such as a square block, as is represented by the baetyls of Petra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/gods.html |title=Nabataean Religion: Pantheon |publisher=Nabataea.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a large amount of detailed sculpture found of Dushura. One specific piece shows a Hellenistic face, showing action and fleshy, vivacious characteristics.&lt;ref name="civca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cmc/petra/petra5e.shtml |title=PETRA: Lost City of Stone |language=fr |publisher=Civilization.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonly represented Gods would include: [[Al-Uzza]], [[Al-Kutbay]], [[Nike (mythology)]], and the [[Zodiacs]].&lt;ref name="civca"/&gt;

===Betyls===
[[File:Basel 2012-08 Mattes 1 (215).JPG|thumb|alt=Betyl|Betyl]]
Betyls ([[Baetylus]]) are another tool used for the representation of Gods and Goddesses beyond traditional sculpture. They appear in abundance in Nabataean art. They are often carved within shrines in both public and private places. Some have pedestals or are set within niches. Betyls were used to embody their gods, most often, although not exclusively, Dushara. They can be all sizes, in groups, or stand alone. They appear as relief sculpture and in the round. The carvings are rectangular and non-figural, though in some cases they have stylized eyes and a nose, similar to Aramic and South Arabian face stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wenning (2001). ''The Betyls of Petra.'' Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research , No. 324, Nabataean Petra. pp. 79-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

Few instances of Nabataean painting have survived. Most are fragments of purely decorative interior painting. There has been enough to demonstrate, however, that they follow the contemporary [[Hellenistic art#Paintings and mosaics|Hellenistic style]], in which few paintings remain.&lt;ref name="Guardian art article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=Discovery of ancient cave paintings in Petra stuns art scholars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/22/hellenistic-wall-paintings-petra|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=21 August 2010|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nabataean Painting Biclinium 849 Siq al-Barid Jordan1508.jpg|thumb|left|Ceiling frescoes in the Painted House at Little Petra|alt=A painted fresco with many dark spotted areas. In a clearer area closer to the bottom are vines, flowers, and a running squirrel]]
In 2010, it was revealed that a biclinium, now known colloquially as the Painted House, at [[Little Petra]] in [[Jordan]] had extensive ceiling [[fresco]]es, which had long been concealed under soot from [[Bedouin]] campfires, and other inscriptions in the ensuing centuries. A three-year [[art restoration|restoration]] project had made them visible again. They depict, in extensive detail and with a variety of media, including [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] and [[gold leaf]], imagery such as grapevines and ''[[putto|putti]]'' associated with the Greek god [[Dionysus]], suggesting the space may have been used for wine consumption, perhaps with visiting merchants. In addition to being the only known example of Nabataean interior [[figurative art|figurative]] painting ''[[in situ]]'', they are one of the very few examples of Hellenistic painting extant, and have been considered superior to later Roman imitations of the style at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref name="Guardian art article" /&gt;

The '''National Prize for Plastic Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Artes Plásticas'''}}) was created in [[Chile]] in 1992 under Law 19169 as one of the replacements of the [[National Prize of Art of Chile|National Prize of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is granted "to the person who has distinguished himself by his achievements in the respective area of the arts" (Article 8 of the aforementioned law). It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The prize, which is awarded every two years, consists of a diploma, the sum of 6,576,457 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] ({{US$|{{To USD|6576457|CHL|round=yes}}}}) which is adjusted every year, according to the previous year's [[consumer price index]], and a pension of 20 {{ill|Monthly tax unit|es|Unidad tributaria mensual|lt=monthly tax units}} (approximately US$1,600).

Objectif Exhibitions (originally typeset as "objectif_exhibitions")&lt;ref name="objectif-exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectif-exhibitions.org/1999-2007|title=objectif_exhibitions|publisher=objectif-exhibitions.org|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1999 by [[Philippe Pirotte]], Win Van den Abbeele, and Patrick Van Rossem. [[Pirotte]] served as its first director from 1999 to 2004. When [[Pirotte]] became director of [[Kunsthalle Bern]], Van den Abbeele became the second director of Objectif Exhibitions. In 2007, Mai Abu ElDahab became the new director, and shifted the programmatic focus to one-person exhibitions, as well as publications and events. Chris Fitzpatrick is the current director, and was hired in 2012.&lt;ref name="bamart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bamart.be/en/news/detail/7220/0/0/34/|title=Chris Fitzpatrick appointed new artistic director of Objectif-Exhibitions &amp;#124; Flanders Arts Institute|publisher=bamart.be|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectif Exhibitions is currently located at Kleine Markt 7-9, and was moved to its current space in 2007 by ElDahab. [[Willem Elsschot]] once lived in the residence above, and the ground floor and basement facilities inspired Elsschot's classic novel "Kaas (Cheese)." Objectif Exhibitions was formerly located at Coquilhatstraat 14.

{{expand Spanish|Bosque de Oma|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Bosque de Oma (10).JPG|thumb|right|220px]]

'''Oma forest''' is a work of art created by ''[[Agustin Ibarrola]]'', a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] sculptor and painter. The work is located in a forest near Kortezubi (Bizkaia, [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]), in the natural reserve of Urdaibai. It is also known as the "painted forest".

The work follows the modern art trend called “Land art”. Most of the trees are [[Monterey pine]]s. The projects aims to display the horrible and ghastly harmony between nature and human presence by painting on the trunks of trees, human figures, animals and geometric shapes, some of which are visible only from certain positions.

[[File:Bosque de Oma (28).JPG|thumb|En 2009.|220px]]
Agustin is a member of “Basta Ya", a group which aims to aid victims of terrorism. Some 100 trees of the natural reserve were destroyed in 2000 and Oma forest was damaged to protest his stand.

The '''Oppenheim Toy Portfolio''' was founded in 1989 as the only independent consumer review of children's media by [[child development]] experts Joanne Oppenheim and her daughter Stephanie Oppenheim.

In 1989 Joanne was already an expert on children's play and [[toy]]s with her books, Kids &amp; Play and Buy Me! Buy Me!. In addition to her 40 plus children's books, Joanne's by-line appeared in Working Mother Magazine, [[Parents (magazine)|Parents]], [[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]], [[Child (magazine)|Child]], [[Family Circle]] and [[Ladies' Home Journal]]. She wrote other parenting books while on the publication staff at The [[Bank Street College of Education]], where she received her Masters in Children's Literature. Her books have won the Mott Literacy Award, the National Council for Social Studies Carter G. Woodson Book Award and she is the recipient of the Curious George Award for Literacy. (For a fuller bio visit joanneoppenheim.com.)

In 1989 Stephanie was practicing [[corporate law]] in [[New York City|NYC]]. Since she was five she wanted to be a [[lawyer]]—like her dad, grandfather, great uncle and brother. It was amusing that her mother played with toys for a living. Her friends starting calling for toy advice from Joanne...which mobile? which ride on? Quite honestly, Stephanie couldn't quite understand what the big deal was...you go to the store and buy a toy. When Stephanie had her first son, everything changed. She quickly discovered that there was no independent consumer information about children's media. After many lengthy conversations, Stephanie convinced Joanne to start the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.

The original [[newsletter]] was a big hit and the mother/daughter team wrote their first book together for [[HarperCollins]] in 1994, The Best Toys, Books, Videos and Music for Kids. In 1998, they formed their own [[publishing company]] and published the first annual Oppenheim Toy Portfolio. They also published their Read It! Play It! Literacy Series. During this time, Joanne published several more books for and about children and welcomed seven grandchildren into the family. Stephanie had another child and received a Masters in [[Psychology]] from [[New York University|NYU]] with a specialization in [[parenting|parenthood]].

Their Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awards have become a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] of excellence with consumers, toy makers and the media. They have appeared on OPRAH, [[CNN]], [[NBC Nightly News]], ABC World News Tonight, [[MSNBC]], Lifetime, and both are Contributors to NBC's TODAY Show.

'''Otis College of Art and Design''' is a private art school and design school in the [[Westchester, Los Angeles|Westchester]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California. Established in 1918, it was the city's first independent professional school of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aicad.org/schools/otis-college-of-art-and-design/|work=Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design|title=Otis College of Art and Design|archive-url=http://archive.is/xKIxZ|archive-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main campus is located in the former [[IBM|IBM Aerospace]] Headquarters at 9045 [[Lincoln Boulevard (Southern California)|Lincoln Boulevard]] in Westchester, Los Angeles.

The school's programs, accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges|WASC]] and [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]], include four-year BFA degrees in [[illustration]], [[fine art]]s, [[graphic design]], [[architecture]], [[landscape design]], [[interior design]], [[fashion design]], [[digital media]], [[toy|toy design]], and [[product design]]. It also offers MFA degrees in [[fine arts]], [[graphic design]], public practice, and [[writing]]. 

Undergraduate students choose a major in their second year, after completing a battery of traditional drawing, painting, composition, and construction classes in their first or "Foundation" year. In addition to studio work, standard [[liberal arts]] courses are required, although traditional history courses are replaced by [[art history]].

== History ==
[[File:Otiscollege.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The Ahmanson building at Otis College of Art and Design]]
Otis, long considered one of the major art institutions in California, began in 1918, when ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' founder [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] bequeathed his [[Westlake, Los Angeles]], property to start the first public, independent professional school of art in Southern California. The current Otis College main campus (since Spring 1997) is located in the Westchester area of Los Angeles, close to the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. The main building (built in 1963) was designed by architect [[Eliot Noyes]] for IBM and is famous for its computer "[[punched card]]" style windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The IBM Punched Card |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/punchcard/impacts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was extensively remodeled in 1997 by the college when it moved from its original location across the street from [[MacArthur Park]] near downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Otis College of Art and Design Timeline/History |url=http://www.otis.edu/history-timeline|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galef Center, made for the Fine Arts department, was designed by Fredrick Fisher and built in 2001.

A [[ceramic art|ceramics]] school was begun by [[Peter Voulkos]] at Otis in the 1950s and was part of art movements like the Craft-to-Art movement, also known as the [[American Clay Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PETER VOULKOS |work=ArtScene |accessdate=2012-08-05 |url=http://artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles1996/Articles0296/Voulkos.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which influenced the [[Ferus Gallery]] scene of the 1960s. Many prominent artists associated with Southern California’s Light and Space movement were involved with the school, as well as leaders of the conceptual art world of the 1970s. Moreover, Otis nurtured significant Latino artists, and the mural group [[Los Four]] also originated at Otis in the 1970s.

The school was originally named Otis Art Institute. From 1978 until 1991, it was affiliated with New York's [[Parsons School of Design]] and known as Otis-Parsons (full name: Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, A Division of the New School for Social Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/17/archives/parsons-and-otis-art-school-merger.html|title=Parsons and Otis: Art School Merger|date=May 17, 1979|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affiliation allowed students to spend a semester or more at the Parsons schools in New York and Paris. In 1991, it became independent and known as Otis College of Art and Design.

The '''Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit''' ({{lang-es|'''Orden al Mérito Artístico y Cultural Pablo Neruda'''}}) was created in 2004 by the [[National Council of Culture and the Arts (Chile)|National Council of Culture and the Arts]] of the government of [[Chile]], as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] (12 July 1904).&lt;ref name=Postino&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cultura.gob.cl/ministro/en-estreno-mundial-de-%e2%80%98il-postino%e2%80%99-ministro-de-cultura-entrego-orden-al-merito-pablo-neruda/ |title=En estreno mundial de 'Il Postino': Ministro de Cultura entregó Orden al Mérito Pablo Neruda |trans-title=World Premiere of 'Il Postino': Minister of Culture Delivered Pablo Neruda Order of Merit |publisher=[[National Council of Culture and the Arts (Chile)|National Council of Culture and the Arts]] |language=Spanish |date=24 September 2010 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Sanskrit and Hindi authors have critiqued and reviewed the works and the literary style of Rambhadracharya, prominent among them being [[Kalika Prasad Shukla]], [[Rewa Prasad Dwivedi]], [[Kala Nath Shastry|Devarshi Kala Nath Shastry]] and [[Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra]]. In his conversations and speeches, Rambhadracharya often employs extemporaneously composed  verses in ''Upajāti'' metre and the ''Daṇḍaka'' style with long adjectives. In his poems, the three classical styles of ''Pāñcālī'', ''Vaidarbhī'' and ''Lāṭī'' are dominant. Some distinguishing features of his Sanskrit poetry include use of rhyme (''Antyānuprāsa''), employment of a variety of [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] including many Prakrit and Hindi metres, new usages, and the ''Gīti'' style. Rambhadracharya is credited with reviving the letter-poem (''Patrakāvya'') genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years. His Sanskrit commentaries have a broad coverage with theories supported by evidence, novel interpretations, elaborate derivations, and an independent style with quotes from the works of Tulsidas accompanied by Sanskrit poetic translations. His Hindi lyrical works follow the Bhojpuri tradition with emphasis on both the aesthetics and emotion. Optimism, devotion to motherland, and patriotism are some more features of his works which are seen in several poems and plays.

==Overview==
Rewa Prasad Dwivedi writes in his Sanskrit poem dedicated to Rambhadracharya that he is an encyclopedia of learning whose literature is like numerous [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers flowing out simultaneously, and in whose literary works [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] delight while performing [[Tandava]] and [[Lasya]].&lt;ref name="rpd-review"&gt;Dwivedi, Rewa Prasad. "विलसन्ति रामभद्राः [The revered Rambhadracharya is resplendent]" (in Sanskrit). In Sharma, Sushil and Shrivastav (2011), pp. 643–648. "येषामास्यमहाभ्रकूटशिखरादाविर्भवन्त्येकदैवानेकाः खलु नर्मदास्त्रिजगतीं सम्प्लावयन्त्यो गिरः। तेषां वस्तु किमस्तु दुर्लभमिह श्रीरामभक्तः शिवो यद्वाचां प्रसरेषु नृत्यति मुदा देव्या भवान्या समम्॥", "तं सारस्वतकोशमद्भुतमिमं श्रीरामभद्राभिधं किं सम्भावयितुं क्रमेत न सुधीप्रज्ञावतां मण्डलम्॥".&lt;/ref&gt;

Devarshi Kala Nath Shastry writes in his review of Rambhadracharya's works that Rambhadracharya is an accomplished and eloquent poet who is the foremost among scholars and is also well-versed in all scriptures. Shastry writes that among Sanskrit poets, only Śrīharṣa (poet of ''Naiṣadhīyacaritam'') has been described as having such wonderful command over Sanskrit as Rambhadracharya has.&lt;ref name="kns-review"&gt;Shastry, Devarshi Kala Nath. "अलौकिक प्रतिभा को श्रद्धार्घ्य [A reverential offering to a superhuman talent]" (in Hindi). In Sharma, Sushil and Shrivastav (2011), pp. 643–648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
Shastry writes that Rambhadracharya even talks in extemporaneously composed poetry with Sanskrit scholars, usually in the ''Upajāti'' metre. Rambhadracharya uses with great effect the ''Daṇḍaka'' style with Sanskrit adjectives in his speeches. Shastry recounts a use of a long sentence in the ''Daṇḍaka'' style at a speech in Jaipur in July 2003 by Rambhadracharya, in which one sentence with multiple adjectives lasted around seven minutes and was "replete with poetic beauty".&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt;

Shastry says that rhyme (''Antyānuprāsa'') is a distinguishing feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, which is most evident in the poetic work ''Ājādacandraśekharacaritam'' on the life of [[Chandrashekhar Azad]]. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of [[Atharva Veda]], various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya.&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt;

Dinkar notes that in the poems of Rambhadracharya, the three poetical styles of ''Pāñcālī'' (secondary figurative sense with short and sweet-sounding compounds), ''Vaidarbhī'' (with compounds and soft contexts and without many figures of speech) and ''Lāṭī'' (with precise contexts and without many figures of speech) are dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rasas===
The principal [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] (emotion or mood) of [[Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam]] is the ''Vīra Rasa'' (the emotion of heroism). Like the previously composed [[Mahakavya|Mahākāvyas]], Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has all the eight Rasas as enunciated by [[Bharata Muni]]. These Rasas are – ''Śringāra'' (eros and beauty), ''Vīra'' (heroism or bravery), ''Hāsya'' (mirth), ''Raudra'' (fury), ''Karuṇa'' (compassion), ''Bībhatsa'' (disgust), ''Bhayānaka'' (horror), ''Adbhuta'' (amazement). Apart from this Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam also has the ninth ''Rasa'' as propounded by [[Mammaṭa]] – the ''Śānta'' Rasa (calmness), and the three new Rasas as – ''Bhakti'' (devotion), ''Vatsala'' (parental love) and ''Preyas'' (love). The principle Rasas in the ''[[Ashtavakra (epic)]]'' are the ''Vīra'' and the ''Karuṇa''.&lt;ref name="ashtavakra_purovak"&gt;Rambhadracharya 2010, pp. ''ka''–''ga''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the 10th canto of [[Bhagavata Purana|Śrīmad Bhāgavatam]] and Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, twelve verses in the seventeenth canto (17.42–17.53) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam have all the twelve Rasas used in the same context.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; While the pure Śṛngāra Rasa is the dominant Rasa in ''[[Bhṛṅgadūtam]]'', ''[[Srisitaramakelikaumudi|Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī]]'' is a work primarily of Vātsalya Rasa mixed with Śṛngāra Rasa. ''Rāghavagītaguñjana'' and ''Bhaktigītasudhā'' are works full of the Bhakti Rasa.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

==Styles of individual works==

===''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam''===
Shastry critiqued the work ''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam'' in the January 2003 issue of the Sanskrit monthly ''Bhāratī''. Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of language which has not been seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father, [[Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri]]. The 20th canto has 63 Sanskrit verses (20.1–20.63) composed in Prakrit metres, namely Kirīṭa (Meduradanta, a type of Sapādikā), Ghanākṣarī, Duramilā (Dvimilā, a type of Sapādikā), Mattagajendra (a type of Sapādikā), Śaṭpada and Harigītaka. The language of the verses in Sanskrit, but the metres and the prosody rules follow Prakrit prosody.&lt;ref&gt;Dinkar 2008, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the following verse (20.13) in the Ghanākṣarī metre, which consists of 32 syllables in every foot.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book | language=Sanskrit | date=October 30, 2002 | title = Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (Saṃskṛtamahākāvyam) |trans-title=Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (An epic Sanskrit poem) | first=Svami | last=Rambhadracharya | author-link=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya | place=Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh, India | publisher=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University|url=http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/JR2002Sribhargavaraghaviyam.pdf|accessdate=1 October 2012|page=451 (157)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Brajesh Dikshit, Sanskrit scholar from [[Jabalpur]], says that ''Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam'' combines the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics - it has two leading characters like in [[Bhāravi]]'s ''Kirātārjunīyam'', the poetic excellence and variety of prosodic metres is like in Śrīharṣa's ''Naiṣadhīyacaritam'', while the length and extent of the work is like the ''Śiśupālavadham'' of [[Māgha]].&lt;ref name="bd-review"&gt;Dikshit, Dr. Brajendra. "अतुला गीर्जगद्गुरोः [The speech of Jagadguru is incomparable]" (in Sanskrit, Hindi). In Sharma, Sushil and Shrivastav (2011), pp. 719–721.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra]], former Vice-Chancellor of [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]] wrote in the introduction to Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam that the epic nourishes the tradition of Ṛṣis, and with this composition the contemporary Sanskrit literature has been blessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mishra | first=Abhiraj Rajendra | chapter=नान्दीवाक् | title=श्रीभार्गवराघवीयम् (संस्कृतमहाकाव्यम्) |trans-title=Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam (Sanskrit epic) | quote=... महाकाव्यान्यद्यापि भूयस्त्वेन प्रणीयन्ते। परन्तु न क्वचिल्लक्ष्यन्ते काव्यगुणाः। व्याकरणदोषाः पदे पदे मनःक्लेशान् जनयन्ति। ... मन्ये श्रीभार्गवराघवीयमहाकाव्यमिदं तस्य विपर्ययस्यापवादो भविष्यति। ...परन्तु महाकाव्यमिदमार्षपरम्परां पुष्णाति। ... धन्यतामुपयाति रचनयाऽनयाऽर्वाचीनसंस्कृतसाहित्यम्। |trans-chapter=Introduction | pages=i–iii | year=2002 | publisher=Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University | location=Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh, India | chapterurl=http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/sbr/introduction.php | accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam''===
Dr. Shivram Sharma, Sanskrit scholar from [[Varanasi]], writes in his review of ''[[Shriraghavkripabhashyam|Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam]]'' on the eleven Upanishads that it is replete with novel thoughts and Sanskrit derivations, and that Rambhadracharya has shown Rama as the ''Pratipādya'' of the all Upanishads by the wonderful dexterity of ''Vyutpatti''s of Sanskrit words. Sharma adds that the style of interspersed Sanskrit translations of the works of Tulsidas further enhances the literary merit of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sharma| first=Dr. Shivram| title=ईशावास्याद्येकादशोपनिषत्सु विशिष्टाद्वैतपरकं श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम्|trans-title=The Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam commentary as per Viśiṣṭādvaita on Eleven Upanishads |language=Sanskrit|page=Back Cover | publisher=[[Tulsi Peeth|Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas]] | place=Chitrakoot, Satna, India| date= April 5, 1998| quote=श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यं सर्वत्रैवाभिनवविचारैर्व्युत्पत्तिभिश्चालङ्कृतं विभाति। भाष्येऽस्मिन्नाचार्यचरणैः शब्दव्युत्पत्तिचातुरीचमत्कारेण सर्वोपनिषदां प्रतिपाद्यः भगवान् श्रीराम एवेति सिद्धान्तितम्। मध्ये मध्ये गोस्वामिश्रीतुलसीदासग्रन्थेभ्यः ससंस्कृतरूपान्तरमुदाहृता अंशविशेषाः सुवर्णे सुरभिमातन्वन्ति।}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Vishnu Dutt Rakesh, Hindi professor and author from [[Haridwar]], says that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on Bhagavad Gita has the broadest coverage of all Sanskrit commentaries on Gita with "convincing discussion, propounding of theories with evidence, contradiction of others, creative genius and an independent style of composition".&lt;ref name="vdr-review"&gt;Rakesh, Dr. Vishnu Dutt. ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣya – Commentary on Śrīmadbhagavadgītā''. In Nagar (2002), pp. 735–743.&lt;/ref&gt; Dikshit says that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on the [[Prasthanatrayi|Prasthānatrayī]] is formidable and adorns the Ramananda tradition with greatness. He adds that the ''Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam'' on Narada Bhakti Sutra and Śrīrāmastavarājastotram are successful in establishing the five ''Prasthāna''s in place of the three ''Prasthāna''s of Prasthānatrayī.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt; Dr. Ram Chandra Prasad, author of bilingual English and Hindi commentaries on the Ramcharitmanas, says that the ''Mahavīrī'' commentary is "adorned with erudition" and considers it to be "the best exposition of Hanuman Chalisa."&lt;ref name="prasad-hc"&gt;Prasad 1999, p. 849: श्रीहनुमानचालीसा की सर्वश्रेष्ठ व्याख्या के लिए देखें महावीरी व्याख्या, जिसके लेखक हैं प्रज्ञाचक्षु आचार्य श्रीरामभद्रदासजी। श्रीहनुमानचालीसा के प्रस्तुत भाष्य का आधार श्रीरामभद्रदासजी की ही वैदुष्यमंडित टीका है। इसके लिए मैं आचार्यप्रवर का ऋणी हूँ। [For the best explanation of Hanuman Chalisa, refer the ''Mahāvīrī'' commentary, whose author is the visually-disabled Acharya Rambhadradas.

===Other works===
[[Kalika Prasad Shukla]] was one of the examiners of the PhD dissertation of Rambhadracharya (then known as Giridhar Mishra) in 1981. After examining his Sanskrit thesis titled ''Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe Apāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ'' (''Deliberation on the non-[[Pāṇini|Paninian]] usages in the [[Adhyatma Ramayana]]''), he wrote a Sanskrit verse–&lt;ref&gt;Nagar 2002, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kalanath Shastry also critiqued the work ''Bhṛṅgadūtam'', about which he says that it has many new usages (''Prayoga''s) not seen earlier in Sanskrit poetry. As per Shastry, new dimensions in Sanskrit literature are seen in the play ''Śrīrāghavābhyudayam'' where there are songs in the ''Gīti'' style, and [[Gitaramayanam|Gītarāmāyaṇam]] which is an epic poem in the ''Gīti'' style of [[Gita Govinda|Gītagovindam]] by [[Jayadeva]].&lt;ref name="kns-review"/&gt; Dikshit writes that ''Kubjāpatram'' is a revival of the letter-poem (''Patrakāvya'') genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years, and is the first work in Sanskrit literature whose lead character is disabled.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

Dikshit is of the view that the eight ''Utprekṣā'' figures of speech in ''Śrīrāghavabhāvadarśanam'' have excelled the ''Utprekṣā'' style of the poet Karṇapūra, while the erudition and poetic skill displayed in ''Śrīsarayūlaharī'' makes the reader forget the ''Gaṅgālaharī'' of [[Paṇḍitarāja Jagannātha]]. He holds the work [[Arundhati (epic)|Arundhatī]] to be an eminent epic in [[Khariboli|Khariboli Hindi]] after the [[Kamayani|Kāmāyanī]] of [[Jaishankar Prasad]]. He observes that while Kāmāyanī goes from creation to optimism to pessimism and ends with indifference, Arundhatī is optimistic from beginning to end and establishes the virtues of Hinduism as enshrined in the Ramayana. About the lyrical Hindi works ''Rāghavagītaguñjana'' and ''Bhaktigītasudhā'', Dikshit says that the works are steeped in Bhakti Rasa and are reminiscent of the works of Tulsidas, [[Surdas]] and Mirabai.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt; On ''Bhaktigītasudhā'', Shraddha Gupta writes that the work follows the Bhojpuri tradition where the sentimental and artistic aspects are both developed.&lt;ref name="sg-review"&gt;Gupta, Shraddha. ''Bhaktigītasudhā – An appraisal''. In Nagar (2002), pp. 744–747.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dikshit says that the nationalistic play ''Śrīrāghavābhyudayam'' establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work ''Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī'' saying that it represents all the six ''Sampradāya''s of Indian literature (''Rīti'', ''Rasa'', ''Alaṅkāra'', ''Dhvani'', ''Vakrokti'' and ''Aucitya''), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of ''Ritikavya'' poets like [[Raskhan]], [[Keshavdas]], Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the [[Sringara|Śṛngāra]] Rasa, ''Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī'' is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.&lt;ref name="bd-review"/&gt;

A record fair is an event where individuals can buy, sell, and/or trade recorded music, which is generally in the form of [[vinyl records]]. Most record fairs are open to anyone, but they are of special interest to individuals (such as record collectors, [[disc jockey]]s, and [[record producer]]s) who are looking for recordings that are rare, out-of-print, difficult to find, or produced in limited numbers.

'''''Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America''''' is a 2009 non-fiction book by [[Rich Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113543979|date=6 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=A Black Author's Journey Into American 'Whitopia'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1929729,00.html|title=America's Booming White Enclaves|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=James, Randy|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Benjamin briefly summarized his experiences in a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

==Overview==
African American journalist [[Rich Benjamin]] documents his journeys to find out why more and more white Americans move to small towns and areas that are, for the most part, white, and to explain why Whitopias are growing and what it means for the United States.

Benjamin mounted a two-year tour of the United States, covering 26,907 miles (43,303 km), looking for "Whitopias", which he defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVSZAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Searching For Whitopia|website=[[Google Books]]|pages=2|author=Benjamin, Rich|publisher=[[Hachette Books]]|date=2009|authorlink=Rich Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*an area which has experienced at least 6% growth rate since 2000;
*the great majority of that growth consists of white persons;
*the area has a pleasant look, feel, ambiance, or charm.

He spent several months in three such areas: [[St. George, Utah]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], and [[Forsyth County, Georgia]]. In each case, he generated a master plan to thoroughly immerse himself in the community's core, with lists of the power brokers, the important groups, and the significant events. He tried to volunteer or involve himself with those people and groups.

==Author's experiences==
In St. George, Benjamin rented a house over the [[telephone]] in a gated community, La Entrada.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.tiny.ted.com/talks/rich_benjamin_my_road_trip_through_the_whitest_towns_in_america|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|title=Rich Benjamin: My road trip through the whitest towns in America|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up golfing, fishing, and [[Texas Hold 'Em]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was generally welcomed in every instance, and learned that the dominant topic in St. George was [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]; a local group had been organized to fight immigration, and they held regular rallies.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Idaho, Benjamin rented a resort cabin at [[Lake Coeur d'Alene]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He found a significant number of retired [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers living there,&lt;ref name=T/&gt; and also found a significant number of gun owners where he learned to shoot a pistol at the local gun range.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

He spent time at a retreat, the only non-white journalist in the group, at the Council of [[Aryan Nations]] compound.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was told that the group is not "white-supremacy"; they are "white-segregation" - they merely don't want to live in close proximity to non-white people.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He noted the preponderance of [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Georgia he found the predominant cultural activity revolved around a mega-church, so he involved himself in its activities.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He felt the most comfortable in this situation, since both blacks and whites in this area are used to seeing the other - as contrasted to the first two sites, where a black person is still a rarity.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed in 1984 on a commission from the BBC Philharmonic, who gave the world premiere on 19 February 1985, at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, with [[Edward Downes]] conducting.

==Character and materials==
The form of the symphony, along with those of its predecessors, owes a great debt to the symphonies of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] {{harv|Warnaby|2001}}. A second influence came from Renaissance architecture, particularly the churches of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. Davies explains that his use of [[Fibonacci numbers]] to proportion the symphony was modelled directly on Brunelleschi's structures {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=2}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (second doubling alto flute, third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. Unlike the preceding two symphonies, the only percussion instruments employed in the Third are the timpani. Here they often assume a soloistic role (even more than in the [[Symphony No. 2 (Davies)|Second Symphony]]) in order to emphasize the focal [[pitch class]]es {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=43}}.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in four movements:
# Lento – Adagio – Andante – Moderato – Allegretto – Allegro moderato – Allegro – Allegro alla breve
# Scherzo I: Allegro
# Scherzo II: Allegro vivace: scorrevole e bisbigliando
# Lento – Adagio flessibile
Each of these movements is based on the same architectural outline, but expresses it with a different constructional technique. In addition, this same outline informs the construction of the symphony as a whole, and is also used as the basis of subdividing sections of each movement {{harv|Davies|1985}}. 

The symphony begins with a movement approximating the traditional [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]] {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=425}}. It begins in slow tempo in the tonality of D, quoting in the flutes a [[plainsong]] addressed to the [[Archangel Michael]], "Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in praelio", and the movement becomes progressively faster until the opening material and tonality returns and "the music is blown right away, as if it were on scurrying air-currents" {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=2}}. The pitches of the chant are first "sieved" by to retain only the first occurrence of pitch classes. This results in a seven-note sequence, which is expanded to an eight-note set by the arbitrary addition of D. This set is then arranged in an 8 x 8 transposition square (where the row is transposed successively to begin on each of its eight pitches), and this square is manipulated according to the 64-element [[Magic square#Europe|Magic Square of Mercury]] {{harv|Jones|1998|loc=18–20}}. At the same time, durations are built according to Fibonacci numbers descending from 21 downwards, with each number representing a multiple of a [[breve]] unit {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=415}}. Within this process of acceleration the pitch material converges onto a centre of F which, together with B and A-flat, forms an alternative tonal centre to the tonic D throughout the symphony {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=413}}.

The second and third movements are a pair of scherzos. The composer likens the second movement to the visual experience of contemplating a Brunelleschi church nave from a fixed central point. In addition, there was a “physical inspiration”, of nesting seabirds wheeling around a towering cliff face {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}. 

The second of the pair of scherzos distorts the perspective of the first, as if the same nave were being seen from one side. In this movement, the composer consciously borrows a device from the "Burlesque" movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Ninth Symphony]], "where the tumult stops and the composer lets in 'windows'", through which slow passages of the adagio finale are glimpsed {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}. 

The form of the third movement affects the finale in three ways. First, the "windows" disrupt the musical continuity of the previous two movements, and thereby "reducing, but not totally avoiding, the likelihood of an archetypal formal design being used in the finale" {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=425}}. Second, the windows' tonality of C{{Music|sharp}}, the modal dominants G{{Music|sharp}} and F, and the diatonic dominant A (all established by the timpani), anticipate the finale. Thirdly, the windows sections, characterised by texture rather than by motif, recur twice in the finale ({{harvnb|Jones|2000|loc=426}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2002|loc=40}}).  

The finale then returns to the material of the first movement, and develops it more amply {{harv|Davies|1994|loc=3}}.

On the largest scale, the four movements of the symphony combine into a single, overarching “meta-sonata form” {{harv|Jones|2000|loc=431–32}}. All four movements, however, resist structural closure by denying the tonic's usual function of asserting its superiority at the end, and an important aspect of the formal unfolding of the entire work is the oscillation between sections having tonal focus on the one hand with others of a tonally ambiguous polyphony {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=40–41}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10566">[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] composed his '''Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 44''' between 1935 and 1936. The Third Symphony is considered a transitional work in Rachmaninoff's output. In melodic outline and rhythm it is his most expressively Russian symphony, particularly in the dance rhythms of the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, ''Rachmaninoff'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; What was groundbreaking in this symphony was its greater economy of utterance compared to its two predecessors. This sparer style, first apparent in the ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', enhances the emotional power of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew-Walker, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was premiered on November 6, 1936, with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Critical opinion was divided and public opinion negative toward the work. Rachmaninoff remained convinced of the piece's worth, however, and conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the first recording of the work in 1939. Following the reevaluation of Rachmaninoff's work in the 1970s, the symphony has been viewed in a more favorable light and has been frequently played and recorded.

==Form==
The symphony contains only three movements but its central one fulfills the dual role of slow movement and [[scherzo]] — a structural innovation with marked similarities to the third symphony of [[Antonín Dvořák]]. The work employs [[cyclic form]], with the subtle use of a [[leitmotif|motto theme]] combined, as usual with Rachmaninoff's works, with references to the plain-chant ''[[Dies irae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Walker, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Also like Rachmaninoff's motto themes — and thus differing from Tchaikovsky's — it is short and, by tending to assume various shapes, is easily workable for further symphonic development.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is approximately 40 minutes long.

# Lento – Allegro moderato – Allegro
# Adagio ma non troppo – Allegro vivace
# Allegro – Allegro vivace – Allegro (Tempo primo) – Allegretto – Allegro vivace.

==Composition==
Rachmaninoff composed his Third Symphony after writing his ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'' and ''[[Variations on a Theme of Corelli]]''. He arrived at his newly built [[Villa Senar]] on [[Lake Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]] in late April 1935 with the prospect of writing a symphony in mind. Satisfied with his new home and in good spirits, Rachmaninoff seemed definitely up to the task. On May 15 he informed his cousin Sofiya Satina that he had done "some work," and during the following weeks was seriously at work with the composition. However, a three-week cure at Baden-Baden in July, along with a two-week hiatus in August, put Rachmaninoff behind. Five days before leaving Senar at the end of his summer holiday, Rachmaninov wrote to Satin with some dissatisfaction, "I have finished two-thirds in clean form but the last third of the work in rough. If you take into account that the first two-thirds took seventy days of intense work, for the last third – thirty-five days – there is not enough time. Travels begin and I must get down to playing the piano. So it looks as though my work will be put aside until next year."&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 1935–36 concert season, recitals in Switzerland enabled Rachmaninoff to pay a brief visit to Senar. He evidently took the score of the symphony with him when he left, since he had it with him in Paris in February 1936 for Julius Conus to mark bowings in the string parts. Work on the last movement had to wait until the composer arrived at Senar on April 16 for the summer holiday. On June 30, the composer reported to Satina, "Yesterday morning I finished my work, of which you are the first to be informed. It is a symphony. Its first performance is promised to Stokowski—probably in November. With all my thoughts I thank God that I was able to do it!"&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Rachmaninoff arrived in America just in time for final rehearsals of the work's premiere.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for full [[orchestra]] with 3 [[flute]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (the 3rd doubling on [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s in A and B{{music|flat}}, [[bass clarinet]] in A and B{{music|flat}}, 2 [[bassoon]]s, contrabassoon, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s A and B{{music|flat}}, 1 contralto trumpet in F, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[snare drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[tam-tam]], [[xylophone]], 2 [[harp]]s, [[celesta]], and [[stringed instruments|strings]].

==Reactions==

===Critical===
The day after the Third Symphony premiered, Edwin Schloss wrote for ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'' that he found the work "a disappointment," with "echoes ... of the composer's lyric spaciousness of style" but largely sterile.&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Olin Downes]], normally a champion of the composer's works, was not so sure about this piece:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The outward characteristics of Rachmaninoff's style are evident in the work heard on this occasion. It cannot be said, however, that in these pages Mr. Rachmaninoff says things which are new, even though his idiom is more his own than ever before, and free of the indebtedness it once had to Tchaikovsky. Nor is it easy to avoid the impression, at a first hearing of the work, of a certain diffuseness. There is a tendency to over-elaboration of detail, and to unnecessary extensions, so that the last movement, in particular, appears too long. Would not a pair of shears benefit the proportions of this work?&lt;ref&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 324–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Samuel L. Laciar, reviewing the work for the ''Public Ledger'', gave a more positive assessment. He called the symphony "a most excellent work in musical conception, composition and orchestration," adding that Rachmaninoff "has given us another example in this work that it is not necessary to write dissonant music in order to get the originality which is the greatest—and usually the single—demand of the ultra-moderns."&lt;ref name="bl324"&gt;Bertensson and Leyda, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; W. J. Henderson of the ''Sun'' was perhaps most accurate in summing up both the work and the situation the critics faced in assessing it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the creation of a genial mind laboring in a field well known and loved by it, but not seeking now to raise the fruit of heroic proportions.... The first movement is orthodox in its initial statement of two contrasting chief subjects. They are contrasted in the customary way, in temper and tonality. But the working out section pays only polite respect to tradition. The development of themes immediately follows their statement and this is Rachmaninoff's method. The cantabile theme of the first movement is especially attractive in its lyric and plaintive character and the leading subject has virility and possibilities which are not neglected later. In fact, we suspect, after this insufficient first hearing, that there is more organic unity in this symphony through consanguinity of themes than is instantly discernable.&lt;ref name="bl324"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public===
The public was as confused as the critics. Listeners who enjoyed the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Concerto]]s, the [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and, more recently, the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'', came expecting a quite different work than the one they heard. As Barrie Martyn phrases it, "The public had doubtless been misled by the old-style romanticism of the eighteenth Paganini variation and were perplexed to find that Rachmaninoff had after all advanced beyond the 1900s; the critics, on the other hand, condemned him just because they felt that he had not."&lt;ref name="Martyn, 343"&gt;Martyn, 343&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composer===
Rachmaninoff believed the Third Symphony was one of his best works, and its lukewarm reception disappointed and puzzled him. He summed up the situation in a 1937 letter to Vladimir Wilshaw: "It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But——sometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far."&lt;ref name="Martyn, 343"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1010">The '''''Symphony in A major ("Mannheim No. 2")''''' is a Mannheim symphony by [[Johann Stamitz]], probably written sometime from 1741 to 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553194&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might be Stamitz' first symphony.  It is formed in the standard 3-movement symphonic scheme of the time:

#Allegro
#Andante
#Presto

This symphony, just like the others by Stamitz, definitely influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].  It is about 11 minutes long.

The animator, [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] illustrated the original series of Nasrudin books, and also created a film animation featuring the character, titled ''The Thief and the Cobbler'', which was produced by Idries Shah's brother, [[Omar Ali-Shah]]. Unfortunately, this film was taken away from Williams before he had a chance to complete it.&lt;ref name="Mental Floss" /&gt;

In an article in the ''Los Angeles Review of Books'', writer John Zada uses the Sufi materials, including some of the Nasrudin tales, to explain developments in the contemporary world, such as the rise of Islamist fundamentalism under [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and the rise of [[Donald Trump]]. Zada is of the opinion that we need the Sufis' moderate and flexible thinking to counter polemics and fanaticism in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Larb Zada"&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Phoenix Project''''' is a 2015 American science fiction film written and directed by Tyler Graham Pavey.  Corey Rieger, Andrew Simpson, David Pesta, and Orson Ossman star as scientists who attempt to reanimate the dead.

== Plot ==
Perry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead.  The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand "Amps" Garner.  Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges.  Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully.  As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond.  Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.

Their first subject is an insect.  When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects.  Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse.  Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name.  The experiment is once again a failure.  Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject.  Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure.  When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved.  He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate.  Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale.  Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.

Further tests prove failures.  Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests.  Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately.  Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay.  Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps.  Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger.  Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons – his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her.  Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.

After promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved.  Perry admits that he moved the mouse himself, and Amps says that he needs time away from the project.  Devin pushes Perry to perform another test without Amps, and they experience their first unqualified success.  Although initially angry they would operate his machine without permission, Amps also becomes excited.  Perry contacts Carter, apologizes for lying about the grant, and requests that he rejoin them.  Carter returns once he hears about their success.  Meanwhile, Devin convinces Amps to secretly test on a human subject.  When Perry finds out, he threatens to call the police.  Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him.  The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak.  Perry orders them to destroy the equipment, and they leave the lab with Devin in tow.  As they put him in a car, Devin stares wide-eyed at the world around him.

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that "while it earns points for its thoughtful, non-exploitative approach to its subject, [it] is neither brainy enough to attract sci-fi aficionados nor fast-paced enough to please horror fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/phoenix-project-film-review-764532|title='The Phoenix Project': Film Review|last=Scheck|first=Frank|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2015-01-19|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Film Journal International]]'' wrote, "This melancholy take on the Frankenstein story should play well with horror buffs who prefer character conflict to rampaging creatures and gore, but its low-key virtues make break-out appeal unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/film-review-phoenix-project|title=Film Review: The Phoenix Project|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Film Journal International]]|date=2015-01-15|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Rechtshaffen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "a technically impressive but talky sci-fi drama that never quite comes to life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-phoenix-project-movie-review-20150117-story.html|title=Review 'Phoenix Project' fails to rise|last=Rechtshaffen|first=Michael|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe Friar of the ''[[Victoria Advocate]]'' wrote, "The lack of tension proves to be the movie's weakness and at times it feels like the little brother to the excellent 2004 film ''Primer''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/blogs/staff/entries/2015/jan/17/review-the-phoenix-project-2015/|title=Review: THE PHOENIX PROJECT (2015)|last=Friar|first=Joe|work=[[Victoria Advocate]]|date=2015-01-17|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Railway''''', widely known as '''''Gare Saint-Lazare''''', is an 1873 painting by [[Édouard Manet]].  It is the last painting by Manet of his favourite model, the fellow painter [[Victorine Meurent]], who was also the model for his earlier works ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' and the ''[[Luncheon on the Grass]]''.  It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1874, and donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1956.

==Painting==
Meurent is depicted sitting to the left side of the frame, in front of an iron fence near the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in Paris.  The pensive subject is wearing a dark hat and sombre deep blue dress with white details, and is looking towards the viewer, while a sleeping puppy, a fan and an open book rest in her lap. Next to her is a little girl, modelled by the daughter of Manet's neighbour {{ill|Alphonse Hirsch|de}}, a contrasting figure wearing a white dress with large blue bow, standing her back to the viewer, watching through the railings as a train passes beneath them. The black band in the girl's hair echoes the black band around the neck of the woman.  Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opted for the iron grating which "boldly stretches across the canvas" (Gay 106). The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. Modern apartment buildings can be seen in the background - including the house on the {{ill|Rue de Saint-Pétersbourg|fr}}, near the {{ill|Place de l'Europe|fr}}, where Manet had rented a studio since July 1872 - and also a signal box and the [[Pont de l'Europe]].

The arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus, separated from the background by the row of railings. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.  Resting on a parapet to the right of the painting is a bunch of grapes, perhaps indicating that the painting was made in the autumn.  The dog may be a reference to [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]''; Manet had earlier echoed Titian's composition in his ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]''.

==Reception==
Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: "Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. [[caricature|Caricaturists]] ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Katherine H.; Michael L. Keene. ''After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists''. McFarland, 2010. p. 37. {{ISBN|0-7864-4938-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after it was completed, the painting was sold to baritone [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]].  It was sold in 1881 for 5,400 francs to the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], who gave it several names: ''Enfant regardant le chemin de fer'', ''Le pont de l'Europe'', ''A la Gare St. Lazare'', and later just ''Gare St. Lazare''.  It was sold on 31 December 1898 for 100,000 francs to American [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]]. His wife [[Louisine Havemeyer]] left 2,000 artworks to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York on her death in 1929, but she divided a small collection, including ''The Railway'', among her three children.  The painting was donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1956 on the death of her son Horace Havemeyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43340.0 |title=Art Object Page |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003025509/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43340.0 |archivedate=2012-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vancouver Asian Film Festival''' (VAFF) is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] for about 4–5 days in November.  Launching in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2006/11/01/vancouver-asian-festival.html?ref=rss CBC covers VAFF's 10th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt; it is Canada’s oldest Asian film festival, exhibiting films and videos by North American artists of Asian heritage. It was founded in 1995 and debuted in September 1997. Since then, tens of thousands of film lovers have experienced a diverse selection of North American-Asian and international films.

Each year VAFF attracts close to 4,000 audience members over its four-day festival and year-round events. It also reaches many more through word of mouth, pre-festival events, and traditional and social media throughout the year.

Awards include a juried award for Best Canadian Short. Categories include: Narrative (i.e. drama, comedy, romance), Documentary, Animation, and Experimental.  Visiting artists have included [[Ham Tran]], [[Justin Lin]], [[Michael Kang (director)|Michael Kang]] and [[Jessica Yu]], as well as BC filmmakers, [[Mina Shum]] and [[Julia Kwan]].  The festival has been host to major stars such as [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-169830/ping-pong-park-grace-vaff Straight.com covers Grace Park at VAFF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaff.org/news-archives/closing-night-at-vaff-with-grace-park Grace Park at VAFF]&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

VAFF is a not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/festival/Vancouver_Asian_Film_Festival/ Film Festival World]&lt;/ref&gt; VAFF is entirely organized and produced by a group of dedicated volunteers, and is made possible by generous financial support from corporate sponsors, public funders and private donors.

==Mission==
VAFF strives to promote dynamic and innovative images of Asians, especially Canadian Asians, in a typical roles usually not found in mainstream film and television with the belief that in order to have these images, the creative control and storytelling must come from the Asian Canadian communities themselves and the support must begin with these independent Asian filmmakers. Therefore, this festival was created to showcase their works to both Asian and non-Asian audiences. This festival aims to include all Canadian communities and to develop open and appreciative communications between all communities in Vancouver.

[[Image:Timbre Verigar 15 Slovenie SHS 1918.jpg|right|200px|thumb|15-[[heller (money)|heller]] value]]
'''''Verigar''''' was the first [[postage stamp]] series of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], issued in [[Slovenia]] after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] at the end of [[World War I]]. The name of the stamp series is derived from the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] word ''veriga'', meaning 'chain', and depicts a [[slave]] who has broken the chains. The scene symbolizes the freedom of the [[Slavic peoples]] from Austria-Hungary. It was designed by the academic painter [[Ivan Vavpotič]], whose model was the gymnast [[Stane Derganc]].

==Description==
The stamp design includes the abbreviated name of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and [[Gajevica|Gaj’s Latin]] script ("Држава СХС" - "Država SHS"). The stamp design also includes an image that represents a man who has broken the chains enslaving him; he stands in front of a rising sun.

==History==
The first stamps of the series were designed in the late 1918 in [[Ljubljana]] during the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and issued on 3 January 1919 after the creation of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. They were then published in different versions until 1920. In 1925, Vavpotič regretted the choice of the motif, because he found it kitschy.&lt;ref name="Pošta534"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/725/90-let-Verigarjev?nodeid=534 |first=Bojan |last=Bračič |language=Slovenian |title=90 let Verigarjev |trans-title=90 Years of Chainmen |publisher=Pošta Slovenije [Post of Slovenia] |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Slovenija1993verigar.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1993 stamp commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Verigar issue]]

==Commemoration==
On 19 March 1993, the [[Post of Slovenia|Slovenian post office]] issued a new stamp series using the ''Verigar'' man to commemorate its 75th anniversary. Another commemorative stamp was published on the 90th anniversary of the series in 2009.&lt;ref name="Pošta534" /&gt;
