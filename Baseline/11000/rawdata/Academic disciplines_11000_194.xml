[[Image:2dfgrs.png|right|thumb|300px|Rendering of the 2dFGRS data]]
In [[astronomy]], the '''2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey''' (Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey), '''2dF''' or '''2dFGRS''' is a [[redshift survey]] conducted by the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]] (AAO) with the 3.9m [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] between 1997 and 11 April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/sld013.htm Final Status of Survey Observations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304135713/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/sld013.htm |date=March 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data from this survey were made public on 30 June 2003.  The survey determined the large-scale structure in two large slices of the Universe to a depth of around 2.5 billion light years ([[redshift]] ~ 0.2).  It was the world's largest redshift survey between 1998 (overtaking Las Campanas Redshift Survey) and 2003 (overtaken by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]).  Matthew Colless, Steve Maddox and [[John A. Peacock|John Peacock]] were in charge of the project. Team members [[Shaun Cole]] and John Peacock were awarded a share of the 2014 [[Shaw Prize]] in astronomy for results from the 2dFGRS.

== Description ==
The 2dF survey covered an area of about 1500 [[square degree]]s, surveying regions in both the north and the south [[galactic pole]]s.&lt;ref name="AAO's 2dF Intro"&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/description.html 2dFGRS − An Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304173850/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/description.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the fact that the survey instrument has a 2 degree diameter field of view.

The areas selected for observation were previously surveyed by the massive [[APM Galaxy Survey]] (on which Steve Maddox also worked).&lt;ref name="AAO's 2dF Intro" /&gt; The regions surveyed cover roughly 75 degrees of [[right ascension]] for both bands, and the [[declination]] of the North Polar band was about 7.5 degrees while the declination of the South Polar band was about 15 degrees. Hundreds of isolated two degree fields near the South Polar band were also surveyed (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304232459/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/img009.GIF this illustration], where black circles represent survey fields, and the red grid represents the earlier APM survey).

In total, the [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] of 382,323 objects were measured, which includes [[spectrum|spectra]] for 245,591 objects, of which 232,155 were [[galaxies]] (221,414 with good quality spectra), 12,311 are [[star]]s, and 125 are [[quasi-stellar object]]s (quasars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/statusfinal.html 2dFGRS Summary Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304232530/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/statusfinal.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey necessitated 272 required nights of observation, spread over 5 years.

The survey was carried out with the 4 metre [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]], with the '''2dF instrument''' installed at the primary focus permitting the observation of a field of 2 degrees per pointing.  The instrument possesses a [[spectrograph]] equipped with two banks each of 200 optical fibres, permitting the simultaneous measurement of 400 spectra.

The limiting apparent magnitude of the survey is 19.5, covering objects with a [[redshift]] mostly within less than z=0.3 and a median [[redshift]] of 0.11.  The volume of the Universe covered by the survey is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Megaparsec|Mpc]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h'' corresponds to the value of the [[Hubble constant]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, divided by 100. ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.  The largest [[redshift]] observed by the survey corresponds to a distance of 600 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc.

== Survey Results ==

The principal results obtained for the field of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] by the 2dF survey are:

* The measurement of the [[density parameter]] of [[Nonrelativistic|non-relativistic matter]] ([[baryonic matter]] plus [[dark matter]] plus massive [[neutrinos]])
* The detection of [[Baryon acoustic oscillations]], and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter
* Limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter, putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV.

All these results are in agreement with the measurements of other experiments, notably those of [[WMAP]].  They confirm the [[Lambda-CDM model|standard cosmological model]].

The 2dF survey also yields a unique view on our local cosmic environment. In the figure a 3-D reconstruction of the inner parts of the survey is shown, revealing an impressive view on the cosmic structures in the nearby universe. Several [[superclusters]] stand out, such as the [[Sloan Great Wall]], one of the largest structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the universe known to date (see also [[Huge-LQG]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">An '''active surface''' is a surface of a [[radio telescope]] that is under active computer control of its shape.

Large (more than  10&amp;nbsp;m in diameter or length) radio telescopes always bend during operation, due to their enormous weight and the fact that even the strongest materials are not perfectly stiff.  This bending, in the range of a few millimetres, does not affect low frequency operation much, but dramatically reduces the efficiency of the telescope at higher frequencies where the wavelengths are comparable to the distortion.  Typically, the efficiency of a telescope drops appreciably when the deviation from the desired shape is more than 1/10 of the considered wavelength.  An active surface uses numerous small actuators to move the surface panels with respect to the underlying frame, and thus maintain the correct shape.

An active surface can try to compensate for many different types of errors.  The first is gravity&amp;mdash;this is simplest since previous measurements, or even a mathematical model, can be used to predict (and correct) any bending.  More difficult is correction for wind and thermal errors, since these require measuring and correcting in real time.

Some examples of active surfaces are:
*[[Green Bank Telescope]]
*[[Large Millimeter Telescope]]
*[[Sardinia Radio Telescope]]
*[[Noto Radio Observatory]]

The Chinese [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] uses a uniquely ambitious form of active surface, not only correcting errors, but applying deflections of up to {{convert|47|cm}} in order to aim and focus the telescope.

In [[optics]], an '''aperture''' is a hole or an opening through which [[light]] travels.  More specifically, the aperture and [[focal length]] of an [[optical system]] determine the cone angle of a bundle of [[ray (optics)|rays]] that come to a [[focus (optics)|focus]] in the [[image plane]].

An optical system typically has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles (ray bundles are also known as ''pencils'' of light).  These structures may be the edge of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or [[mirror]], or a ring or other fixture that holds an optical element in place, or may be a special element such as a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] placed in the optical path  to limit the light admitted by the system.  In general, these structures are called stops,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and the '''aperture stop''' is the stop that primarily determines the [[Exit pupil|ray cone angle and brightness]] at the [[Cardinal point (optics)|image point]].

In some contexts, especially in [[photography]] and [[astronomy]], ''aperture'' refers to the ''diameter'' of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a [[telescope]], the aperture stop is typically the edges of the [[objective lens]] or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter ''aperture''. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In [[astrophotography]], the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the [[focal length]]. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.

Sometimes stops and diaphragms are called apertures, even when they are not the aperture stop of the system.

The word ''aperture'' is also used in other contexts to indicate a system which blocks off light outside a certain region. In astronomy, for example, a [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] aperture around a [[star]] usually corresponds to a circular window around the image of a star within which the light intensity is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eaton, Peter W. Draper &amp; Alasdair Allan, [http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html Techniques of aperture photometry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311210838/http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun45.htx/node36.html |date=11 March 2007 }} in  PHOTOM -- A Photometry Package, 20 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The aperture stop is an important element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image/[[film plane]]. This can be either unavoidable, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the aperture stop is constrained by things other than the amount of light admitted; however:
*The size of the stop is one factor that affects [[depth of field]]. &lt;!-- There is some confusion here. So let's be clear: Long depth of field occurs when the lens opening, and thus the stop, is small. However, a small opening equals a large f-stop number. --&gt; Smaller stops (larger [[f number]]s) produce a longer [[depth of field]], allowing objects at a wide range of distances to all be in focus at the same time.
*The stop limits the effect of optical [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]]. If the stop is too large, the image will be distorted. More sophisticated optical system designs can mitigate the effect of aberrations, allowing a larger stop and therefore greater light collecting ability.
*The stop determines whether the image will be [[vignetting|vignetted]]. Larger stops can cause the intensity reaching the film or detector to fall off toward the edges of the picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.
*A larger aperture stop requires larger diameter optics, which are heavier and more expensive.

In addition to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more ''field stops'', which limit the system's [[Angle of view|field of view]].  When the field of view is limited by a field stop in the lens (rather than at the film or sensor) [[vignetting]] results; this is only a problem if the resulting field of view is less than was desired.

The [[pupil|biological pupil]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] is its aperture in optics nomenclature; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the [[cornea]] causes the effective aperture (the [[entrance pupil]] in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, although it can range from 2&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|8.3|link=yes}}) in a brightly lit place to 8&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|2.1}}) in the dark.

In astronomy, the diameter of the aperture stop (called the ''aperture'') is a critical parameter in the design of a [[telescope]]. Generally, one would want the ''aperture'' to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount of light from the distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of cost and weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).

Apertures are also used in laser energy control, close aperture [[z-scan technique]], diffractions/patterns, and beam cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian Vaziri|first1=M R|title=Role of the aperture in Z-scan experiments: A parametric study|journal=Chinese Physics B|volume=24|issue=11|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/24/11/114206|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1056/24/11/114206/meta|bibcode = 2015ChPhB..24k4206R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laser applications include spatial filters, Q-switching, high intensity x-ray control.

In light microscopy, the word aperture may be used with reference to either the [[Condenser (microscope)|condenser]] (changes angle of light onto specimen field), field iris (changes area of illumination) or possibly objective lens (forms primary image). ''See'' [[Optical microscope]].

==In photography==
The aperture stop of a [[photographic lens]] can be adjusted to control the amount of [[light]] reaching the [[Photographic film|film]] or [[image sensor]]. In combination with variation of [[shutter speed]], the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] to light.  Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.

[[File:Aperture diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram of decreasing aperture sizes (increasing [[f-number]]s) for "full stop" increments (factor of two aperture area per stop)]]

A device called a [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] usually serves as the aperture stop, and controls the aperture. The diaphragm functions  much like the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the [[Human eye|eye]]&amp;nbsp;– it controls the effective [[diameter]] of the lens opening. Reducing the aperture size increases the [[depth of field]], which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.

The lens aperture is usually specified as an [[f-number]], the ratio of [[focal length]] to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked "f-stops" that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term "one f-stop" refers to a factor of {{radic|2}} (approx. 1.41) change in f-number, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity.

[[Aperture priority]] is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an aperture setting and let the camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also [[ISO sensitivity]] for the correct exposure. This is also referred to as Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php | title=Aperture and shutter speed in digital cameras| work=elite-cameras.com| accessdate=2006-06-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620033626/http://elite-cameras.com/articles/aperture-shutter-speed-digital-cameras.php |archivedate = 2006-06-20}} (original link no longer works, but page was saved by archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical ranges of apertures used in photography are about {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}22 or {{f/}}2–{{f/}}16,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_aperture.html What is... Aperture?]&lt;!-- f/2 instead of f/1.8 is clearer and mathematically more accurate as 1 stop faster than f/2.8 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; covering 6 stops, which may be divided into wide, middle, and narrow of 2 stops each, roughly (using round numbers) {{f/}}2–{{f/}}4, {{f/}}4–{{f/}}8, and {{f/}}8–{{f/}}16 or (for a slower lens) {{f/}}2.8–{{f/}}5.6, {{f/}}5.6–{{f/}}11, and {{f/}}11–{{f/}}22. These are not sharp divisions, and ranges for specific lenses vary.

===Maximum and minimum apertures===
{{further information|Lens speed}}
The specifications for a given lens typically include the maximum and minimum aperture sizes, for example, {{f/}}1.4–{{f/}}22. In this case, {{f/}}1.4 is the maximum aperture (the widest opening), and {{f/}}22 is the minimum aperture (the smallest opening). The maximum aperture opening tends to be of most interest and is always included when describing a lens. This value is also known as the [[lens speed|lens "speed"]], as it affects the exposure time. The aperture is proportional to the square root of the light admitted, and thus inversely proportional to the square root of required exposure time, such that an aperture of {{f/}}2 allows for exposure times one quarter that of {{f/}}4.

Lenses with apertures opening {{f/}}2.8 or wider are referred to as "fast" lenses, although the specific point has changed over time (for example, in the early 20th century aperture openings wider than {{f/}}6 were considered fast{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}). The fastest lenses for the common [[135 film|35 mm film]] format in general production have apertures of {{f/}}1.2 or {{f/}}1.4, with more at {{f/}}1.8 and {{f/}}2.0, and many at {{f/}}2.8 or slower; {{f/}}1.0 is unusual, though sees some use. When comparing "fast" lenses, the [[Film format|image format]] used must be considered. Lenses designed for a small format such as [[Half-frame camera|half frame]] or [[APS-C]] need to project a much smaller [[image circle]] than a lens used for [[Large format (photography)|large format]] photography. Thus the optical elements built into the lens can be far smaller and cheaper.

In exceptional circumstances lenses can have even wider apertures with f-numbers smaller than 1.0; see [[Lens speed#Fast lenses|lens speed: fast lenses]] for a detailed list. For instance, both the current Leica Noctilux-M 50mm ASPH and a 1960s-era Canon 50mm rangefinder lens have a maximum aperture of {{f/}}0.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5048115/leicas-11000-noctilux-50mm-f095-lens-is-a-nightvision-owl-eye-for-your-camera|title=Leica's $11,000 Noctilux 50mm f/0.95 Lens Is a Nightvision Owl Eye For Your Camera|first=John|last=Mahoney|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheaper alternatives have appeared in recent years, such as the [[Cosina Voigtländer]] 17.5mm {{f/}}0.95, 25mm {{f/}}0.95 and 42.5mm {{f/}}0.95 manual focus lenses for the [[Micro Four Thirds System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855215-REG/Voigtlander_BA175M_Nokton_17_5mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 17.5mm f/0.95 Lens for Micro Four BA175M B&amp;H|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/754598-REG/Voigtlander_BA305A_Nokton_25mm_f_0_95_Lens.html|title=Voigtlander BA259M2 Replacement for Voigtlander BA259M - B&amp;H|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1000625-REG/voigtlander_ba425m_nokton_42_5mm_f_0_95_micro.html|title=Voigtlander Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 Micro Four Thirds Lens BA425M|author=|date=|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional lenses for some movie cameras have f-numbers as small as {{f/}}0.75. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' has scenes shot by candlelight with a NASA/Zeiss 50mm f/0.7,&lt;ref&gt;Ed DiGiulio (President, [[Cinema Products Corporation]]). [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/ac/len/page1.htm "Two Special Lenses for ''Barry Lyndon''"]
&lt;/ref&gt; the fastest lens in film history. Beyond the expense, these lenses have limited application due to the correspondingly shallower depth of field&amp;nbsp;– the scene must either be shallow, shot from a distance, or will be significantly defocused, though this may be the desired effect.

Zoom lenses typically have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of {{f/}}2.8 to {{f/}}6.3 through their range. High-end lenses will have a constant aperture, such as {{f/}}2.8 or {{f/}}4, which means that the relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; {{f/}}3.5 to {{f/}}5.6 is an example of a common variable aperture range in a consumer zoom lens.

By contrast, the minimum aperture does not depend on the focal length&amp;nbsp;– it is limited by how narrowly the aperture closes, not the lens design&amp;nbsp;– and is instead generally chosen based on practicality: very small apertures have lower sharpness due to diffraction, while the added depth of field is not generally useful, and thus there is generally little benefit in using such apertures. Accordingly, DSLR lens typically have minimum aperture of {{f/}}16, {{f/}}22, or {{f/}}32, while [[large format]] may go down to {{f/}}64, as reflected in the name of [[Group f/64]]. Depth of field is a significant concern in [[macro photography]], however, and there one sees smaller apertures. For example, the [[Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro lens|Canon MP-E 65mm]] can have effective aperture (due to magnification) as small as {{f/}}96.  The [[Pinhole camera|pinhole]] optic for [[Lensbaby]] creative lenses has an aperture of just {{f/}}177.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |title=Pinhole and Zone Plate Photography for SLR Cameras |work=Lensbaby Pinhole optic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501093047/http://www.lensbaby.com/optics-pinhole.php |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aperture area===
The amount of light captured by a lens is proportional to the area of the aperture, equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Area} = \pi \left({D \over 2}\right)^2 = \pi \left({f \over 2N}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where the two equivalent forms are related via the [[f-number]] ''N = f / D'', with [[focal length]] ''f'' and aperture diameter ''D''.

The focal length value is not required when comparing two lenses of the same focal length; a value of 1 can be used instead, and the other factors can be dropped as well, leaving area proportion to the reciprocal square of the f-number ''N''.

If two cameras of different format sizes and focal lengths have the same [[angle of view]], and the same aperture area, they gather the same amount of light from the scene.  In that case, the relative focal-plane [[illuminance]], however, would depend only on the f-number ''N'', so it is less in the camera with the larger format, longer focal length, and higher f-number.  This assumes both lenses have identical transmissivity.

===Aperture control===
Most [[SLR camera]]s provide ''automatic aperture control'', which allows viewing and metering at the lens's maximum aperture, but stops the lens down to the working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture afterward.&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"&gt;Sidney F. Ray. The geometry of image formation. In ''The Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging'', 9th ed, pp. 136–137. Ed. Ralph E. Jacobson, Sidney F. Ray, Geoffrey G. Atteridge, and Norman R. Axford. Oxford: Focal Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-240-51574-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first SLR cameras with internal ([[Through-the-lens metering|“through-the-lens” or “TTL”]]) meters (e.g., the [[Pentax Spotmatic]]) required that the lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading.  With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shipman|first=Carl|title=SLR Photographers Handbook|date=1977|publisher=HP Books|location=Tucson, AZ|isbn=0-912656-59-X|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing;&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or automatic diaphragm control.

For some lenses, including a few long [[Telephoto lens|telephotos]], lenses mounted on [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]], and [[Perspective control lens|perspective-control and tilt/shift]] lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical,&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt; and automatic aperture control was not provided.  Many such lenses incorporated a feature known as a "preset" aperture,&lt;ref name="Ray2000-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. "Moose" Peterson. ''Nikon System Handbook''. New York: Images Press, 1997, pp. 42–43. {{ISBN|0-929667-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture.  Examples of lenses with this type of preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}4.5.  The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85&amp;nbsp;mm {{f/}}2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.

Accessed 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic aperture control is provided with the newer Nikon digital SLR cameras; with some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control by means of a pushbutton that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm.

===Optimal aperture===
Optimal aperture depends both on optics (the depth of the scene versus diffraction), and on the performance of the lens.

Optically, as a lens is stopped down, the defocus blur at the Depth of Field (DOF) limits decreases but diffraction blur increases. The presence of these two opposing factors implies a point at which the combined blur spot is minimized ([[#CITEREFR Gibson1975|Gibson 1975]], 64); at that point, the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/technical/diffraction.html|title=Diffraction and Optimum Aperture - Format size and diffraction limitations on sharpness|author=|date=|website=www.bobatkins.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a wider aperture (lower ''f''-number) causes more defocus, while a narrower aperture (higher ''f''-number) causes more diffraction.

As a matter of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus generally have better sharpness when stopped down some&amp;nbsp;– note that this is sharpness in the plane of [[critical focus]], setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the {{f/}}4&amp;nbsp;– {{f/}}8 range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.

While optimal aperture can be determined mechanically, how much sharpness is ''required'' depends on how the image will be used&amp;nbsp;– if the final image is viewed under normal conditions (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice to determine the &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt;-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, and there may be no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot.  But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size ([[#CITEREFR Hansma1996|Hansma 1996]]).  Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time; see also [[critical sharpness]].

==Equivalent aperture range==
{{See also|Image sensor format}}
In digital photography, the 35mm-equivalent aperture range is sometimes considered to be more important than the actual f-number.  Equivalent aperture is the f-number adjusted to correspond to the f-number of the same size absolute aperture diameter on a lens with a [[35mm equivalent focal length]].  Smaller equivalent f-numbers are expected to lead to higher image quality based on more total light from the subject, as well as lead to reduced depth of field.  For example, a [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10]] uses a 1" sensor, 24–200&amp;nbsp;mm with maximum aperture constant along the zoom range;  {{f/}}2.8 has equivalent aperture range {{f/}}7.6, which is a lower equivalent f-number than some other {{f/}}2.8 cameras with smaller sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx10 |title=Sony Cyber-shot DSC RX10 First Impressions Review |author=R Butler |accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scanning or sampling==
The terms ''scanning aperture'' and ''sampling aperture'' are often used to refer to the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a [[Drum scanner#Drum|Drum scanner]], an [[image sensor]], or a television pickup apparatus.  The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] a signal waveform.

For example, [[film grain]] is quantified as ''graininess'' via a measurement of film density fluctuations as seen through a 0.048&amp;nbsp;mm sampling aperture.

The '''Bowden development''' is an urban development in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on a site formerly owned by the [[Clipsal]] corporation in the suburb of [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]], within the [[City of Charles Sturt]], in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metropolitan area]] 2.5 kilometres from the city centre. 

The site covers an area of {{convert|10.25|ha}} and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the [[Outer Harbor railway line]] to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/about/progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC41161|name=Bowden (State Suburb)|accessdate=2008-06-07| quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability initiatives==

The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] is a world's best practice rating tool from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]] covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Developer-Green-Star-Fact-Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/bowden-development/&lt;/ref&gt; including commercial buildings such as '''Plant 4 Bowden'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/plant-4-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/princes-terrace-adelaide/&lt;/ref&gt;, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design.

==History==
[[File:Bowden clipsal.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground]] 
The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]'s plans for eleven [[transport-oriented development]]s in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers in the realm of 75 to 80 million Australian dollars were expected however evidently not attained; as the [[2008 economic crisis]] accelerated and falling property prices diminished the likelihood of a sale at expected prices, the South Australian government intervened and announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id%3D3956%26print%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075532/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3956 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2008–2010===

In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site).

Both sites are located within the [[City of Charles Sturt]] and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: “Bowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and  integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/housing-for-clipsal-site/1342897.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden is served by [[Bowden railway station]], [[North Adelaide railway station]], buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] on Port Road, Hindmarsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-34.9043904,138.5777874,17z?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Charles visits Bowden SA.jpg|left|thumb|190x190px|Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden]]

===2011–2015===

In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved &lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bowden-tod-gets-the-nod/story-e6frea83-1226043678620 Adelaide Now].&lt;/ref&gt; and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012.

Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden’s first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets — Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets — opened to the public in May 2013.

In 2014, the restaurant '''Jarmer's Kitchen''' opened&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/jarmers-kitchen-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/first-residents-now-call-bowden-home/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] residential project, the '''Prince's Terraces Adelaide''' which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/princes-terrace-adelaide-breaking-ground/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowden Town Square opening in 2016.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Bowden Town Square opening community celebration]]

===2016-2017===

The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the [[Adelaide Park Lands]] across the road from Bowden in February 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/time-celebrate-bowdens-new-front-yard/&lt;/ref&gt; where the '''Park Terrace Community Garden''' currently resides.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/bowden-life/community-garden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting '''Bowden Park''', the '''Plant 4 Bowden''' retail hub and '''Plant 3''' community hub.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/bowden-moving-forward-500-homes-sold-new-developers-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The cell-disrupting change in pressure is achieved by passing cells through a narrow opening in a [[Microfluidics|microfluidic device]]. The device is made up of channels etched into a [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] through which cells initially flow freely. As they move through the device, the channel width gradually narrows. The cell's flexible membrane allows it to change shape and become thinner and longer, allowing it to squeeze through. As the cell becomes more and more narrow, it shrinks in width by about 30 to 80 times its original size and the forced rapid change in cell shape temporarily creates holes in the membrane, without damaging or killing the cell.

While the cell membrane is disrupted, target molecules that pass by can enter the cell through the holes in the membrane. As the cell returns to its normal shape, the holes in the membrane close. Virtually any type of molecule can be delivered into any type of cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/news/2013/07/researchers-put-squeeze-cells-deliver Researchers put squeeze on cells to deliver].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4147">In [[computer science]], a '''communicating finite-state machine''' is a [[finite state machine]] labeled with "receive" and "send" operations over some alphabet of channels. They were introduced by Brand and Zafiropulo,&lt;ref&gt;D. Brand and P. Zafiropulo. On communicating finite-state machines. Journal of the ACM, 30(2):323-342, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used as a model of [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] processes like [[Petri nets]]. Communicating finite state machines are used frequently for modeling a communication protocol since they make it possible to detect major protocol design errors, including boundedness, deadlocks, and unspecified receptions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosier, Louis E; Gouda, Mohamed G. Deciding Progress for a Class of Communicating Finite State Machines. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of communicating finite state machines is that they make it possible to decide many properties in communication protocols, beyond the level of just detecting such properties. This advantage rules out the need for human assistance or restriction in generality.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brand and P. Zafiropulo. On communicating finite-state machines. Journal of the ACM, 30(2):323-342, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proved with the introduction of the concept itself that when two finite state machines communicate with only one type of messages, boundedness, deadlocks, and unspecified reception state can be decided and identified while such is not the case when the machines communicate with two or more types of messages. Later, it has been further proved that when only one finite state machine communicates with single type of message while the communication of its partner is unconstrained, we can still decide and identify boundedness, deadlocks, and unspecified reception state.&lt;ref&gt;Rosier, Louis E; Gouda, Mohamed G. Deciding Progress for a Class of Communicating Finite State Machines. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been further proved that when the message priority relation is empty, boundedness, deadlocks and unspecified reception state can be decided even under the condition in which there are two or more types of messages in the communication between finite state machines.&lt;ref&gt;Gouda, Mohamed G; Rosier, Louis E. "Communicating finite state machines with priority channels," Automata, Languages and Programming. Antwerp: ICALP, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Boundedness, deadlocks, and unspecified reception state are all decidable in polynomial time (which means that a particular problem can be solved in tractable, not infinite, amount of time) since the decision problems regarding them are nondeterministic logspace complete.&lt;ref&gt;Rosier, Louis E; Gouda, Mohamed G. Deciding Progress for a Class of Communicating Finite State Machines. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communicating finite state machines can be the most powerful in situations where the propagation delay is not negligible (so that several messages can be in transit at one time) and in situations where it is natural to describe the protocol parties and the communication medium as separate entities.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brand and P. Zafiropulo. On communicating finite-state machines. Journal of the ACM, 30(2):323-342, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating Hierarchical State Machine==

Hierarchical state machines are finite state machines whose states themselves can be other machines. Since a communicating finite state machine is characterized by concurrency, the most notable trait in a '''communicating hierarchical state machine''' is the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency. This had been considered highly suitable as it signifies stronger interaction inside the machine. 

However, it was proved that the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency intrinsically costs language inclusion, language equivalence, and all of universality.&lt;ref&gt;Alur, Rajeev; Kannan, Sampath; Yannakakis, Mihalis. "Communicating hierarchical state machines," Automata, Languages and Programming. Prague: ICALP, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compton scattering''', discovered by [[Arthur Compton|Arthur Holly Compton]], is the scattering of a [[photon]] by a [[electric charge|charged]] particle, usually an [[electron]]. It results in a decrease in [[energy]] (increase in [[wavelength]]) of the photon (which may be an [[X-ray]] or [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]), called the '''Compton effect'''. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. '''Inverse Compton scattering''' occurs when a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Compton en.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of Compton's experiment. Compton scattering occurs in the graphite target on the left. The slit passes X-ray photons scattered at a selected angle. The energy of a scattered photon is measured using [[Bragg scattering]] in the crystal on the right in conjunction with ionization chamber; the chamber could measure total energy deposited over time, not the energy of single scattered photons.]]

Compton scattering is an example of [[inelastic scattering]]&lt;ref&gt;Elastic or [[inelastic scattering]]? The incident photon loses energy in the lab frame, which centuries of practice had identified with inelastic scattering—even though, in the c.m.  frame, the respective masses remaining the same, no new species are created and kinetic energy is conserved,  the mark of an ''elastic collision''. As a result, HEP and nuclear physicists prefer to emphasize elasticity, while atomic and molecular physicists use "inelastic". &lt;/ref&gt; of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation.  In Compton's original experiment (see Fig. 1), the energy of the X ray photon (≈17 keV) was very much larger than the binding energy of the atomic electron, so the electrons could be treated as being free.  The amount by which the light's wavelength changes is called the '''Compton shift'''. Although nuclear Compton scattering exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nuclear Compton scattering|author=P. Christillin|year=1986|journal= J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys.|volume=12|pages=837–851|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0305-4616/12/9/008|doi=10.1088/0305-4616/12/9/008|bibcode = 1986JPhG...12..837C|issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton scattering usually refers to the interaction involving only the electrons of an atom. The Compton effect was observed by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and further verified by his graduate student [[Wu Youxun|Y. H. Woo]] in the years following. Compton earned the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery.

The effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a [[wave]] phenomenon.

[[Thomson scattering]], the classical theory of an [[electromagnetic wave]] scattered by charged particles, cannot explain shifts in wavelength at low intensity: classically, light of sufficient intensity for the electric field to accelerate a charged particle to a relativistic speed will cause radiation-pressure recoil and an associated Doppler shift of the scattered light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observation of the Transition from Thomson to Compton Scattering in Optical Multiphoton Interactions with Electrons|author=C. Moore|year=1995|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Moore.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the effect would become arbitrarily small at sufficiently low light intensities ''regardless of wavelength''. Thus, light must behave as if it consists of particles, if we are to explain low-intensity Compton scattering. Or the assumption that the electron can be treated as free is invalid resulting in the effectively infinite electron mass equal to the nuclear mass (see e.g. the comment below on elastic scattering of X-rays being from that effect).  Compton's experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of particle-like objects (quanta called photons), whose energy is proportional to the light wave's frequency.  But see the article on [[Julian Schwinger]] for Schwinger's different assessment of the necessity of any particles at all in a consistent QED or QCD.

As shown in Fig. 2, The interaction between an electron and a photon results in the electron being given part of the energy (making it recoil), and a photon of the remaining energy being emitted in a different direction from the original, so that the overall [[momentum]] of the system is also conserved. If the scattered photon still has enough energy, the process may be repeated. In this scenario, the electron is treated as free or loosely bound. Experimental verification of momentum conservation in individual Compton scattering processes by [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]] as well as by Compton and Simon has been important in disproving the [[BKS theory]].

Compton scattering is one of three competing processes when photons interact with matter.  At energies of a few eV to a few keV, corresponding to [[visible light]] through soft X-rays, a photon can be completely absorbed and its energy can eject an electron from its host atom, a process known as the [[photoelectric effect]]. High energy photons of {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} and above may bombard the nucleus and cause an electron and a positron to be formed, a process called [[pair production]].  Compton scattering is the most important interaction in the intervening energy region.

== Description of the phenomenon ==
[[Image:Compton-scattering.svg|thumb|200px|right|Fig. 2: A photon of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; comes in from the left, collides with a target at rest, and a new photon of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt; emerges at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The target recoils, carrying away an angle-dependent amount of the incident energy.]]
By the early 20th century, research into the interaction of [[X-ray]]s with matter was well under way. It was observed that when X-rays of a known wavelength interact with atoms, the X-rays are scattered through an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and emerge at a different wavelength related to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[classical electromagnetism]] predicted that the wavelength of scattered rays should be equal to the initial wavelength,&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=J.R.|last2=Zafiratos|first2=C.D.|last3=Dubson|first3=M.A.|year=2004|title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-805715-X|pages=136–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; multiple experiments had found that the wavelength of the scattered rays was longer (corresponding to lower energy) than the initial wavelength.&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt;

In 1923, Compton published a paper in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta (Einstein had proposed light quanta in 1905 in explaining the photo-electric effect, but Compton did not build on Einstein's work). The energy of light quanta depends only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron.  His paper concludes by reporting on experiments which verified his derived relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\cos{\theta}),&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the initial wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength after scattering,
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron rest mass]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and
:&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the scattering angle.

The quantity {{sfrac|''h''|''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;c''}} is known as the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron; it is equal to {{val|2.43|e=-12|u=m}}. The wavelength shift {{nowrap|''λ′'' − ''λ''}} is at least zero (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 0°}}) and at most twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 180°}}).

Compton found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron.&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt; Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10000 times smaller.  This is known as "coherent" scattering off the entire atom since the atom remains intact, gaining no internal excitation.

In Compton's original experiments the wavelength shift given above was the directly-measurable observable.  In modern experiments it is conventional to measure the energies, not the wavelengths, of the scattered photons.  For a given incident energy &lt;math&gt;E_\gamma = hc/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the outgoing final-state photon energy, &lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
: &lt;math&gt;
E_{\gamma^\prime} = \frac{E_\gamma}{1 + (E_\gamma/m_e c^2)(1-\cos\theta)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation of the scattering formula ===
[[File:ComptonEnergy.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3: Energies of a photon at 500 keV and an electron after Compton scattering.]]
A photon  {{mvar|γ}}  with wavelength {{mvar|λ}}   collides with an electron {{mvar|e}} in an atom, which is treated as being at rest. The collision causes the electron to [[recoil]], and a new photon {{mvar|γ}}'   with wavelength {{mvar|λ}}'   emerges at angle {{mvar|θ}}  from the photon's incoming path. Let {{mvar|e}}'  denote the electron after the collision. Compton allowed for the possibility that the interaction would sometimes accelerate the electron to speeds sufficiently close to the velocity of light as to require the application of Einstein's [[special relativity]] theory to properly describe its energy and momentum.

At the conclusion of Compton's 1923 paper, he reported results of experiments confirming the predictions of his scattering formula, thus supporting the assumption that photons carry momentum as well as quantized energy.  At the start of his derivation, he had postulated an expression for the momentum of a photon from equating Einstein's already established mass-energy relationship of &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; to the quantized photon energies of &lt;math&gt;h f&lt;/math&gt;, which Einstein had separately postulated. If &lt;math&gt;mc^2 = hf&lt;/math&gt;, the equivalent photon mass must be &lt;math&gt;hf/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. The photon's momentum is then simply this effective mass times the photon's frame-invariant velocity {{mvar|c}}. For a photon, its momentum &lt;math&gt;p=hf/c&lt;/math&gt;, and thus {{math|''hf''}}  can be substituted for {{math|''pc''}}   for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton's paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same sequence as the following derivation.

The [[conservation of energy]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering.
:&lt;math&gt;E_\gamma + E_e = E_{\gamma'} + E_{e'}.\!&lt;/math&gt;
Compton postulated that photons carry momentum;&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt; thus from the [[conservation of momentum]], the momenta of the particles should be similarly related by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_\gamma = \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'} + \mathbf{p}_{e'},&lt;/math&gt;
:in which (&lt;math&gt;{p_e}&lt;/math&gt;) is omitted on the assumption it is effectively zero.

The photon energies are related to the frequencies by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma} = hf\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma'} = hf'\!&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].
Before the scattering event, the electron is treated as sufficiently close to being at rest that its total energy consists entirely of the mass-energy equivalence of its (rest) mass &lt;math&gt; m_e &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;E_e = m_ec^2.\!&lt;/math&gt;
After scattering, the possibility that the electron might be accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light, requires that its total energy be represented using the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;E_{e'} = \sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_ec^2)^2} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these quantities into the expression for the conservation of energy gives
:&lt;math&gt;hf + m_e c^2 = hf' + \sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression can be used to find the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = (hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4. \qquad\qquad (1) \!&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that this magnitude of the momentum gained by the electron (formerly zero) exceeds the energy/c lost by the photon,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{(hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4} &gt; \frac{hf - hf'}{c}~. &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (1) relates the various energies associated with the collision. The electron's momentum change involves a relativistic change in the energy of the electron, so it is not simply related to the change in energy   occurring in classical physics.  The change of the magnitude of the momentum of the photon is not just related to the change of its energy; it also involves a change in direction.
 
Solving the conservation of momentum expression for the scattered electron's momentum gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{e'} = \mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}.&lt;/math&gt;

Making use of the [[scalar product]] yields the square of its magnitude,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p_{e'}^{\, 2} &amp;= \mathbf{p}_{e'}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{e'} = (\mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}) \cdot (\mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}) \\
 &amp;= p_{\gamma}^{\, 2} + p_{\gamma'}^{\, 2} - 2 p_{\gamma}\, p_{\gamma'} \cos\theta. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In anticipation of &lt;math&gt;p_{\gamma}c&lt;/math&gt; being replaced  with &lt;math&gt;h f&lt;/math&gt;, multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = p_{\gamma}^{\, 2}c^2 + p_{\gamma'}^{\, 2}c^2 - 2c^2 p_{\gamma}\, p_{\gamma'} \cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

After replacing the photon momentum terms with &lt;math&gt;h f/c&lt;/math&gt;, we get a second expression for the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = (h f)^2 + (h f')^2 - 2(hf)(h f')\cos{\theta}~. \qquad\qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the alternate expressions for this momentum gives
:&lt;math&gt; (hf - hf' + m_e c^2)^2 - m_e^{\, 2}c^4 = \left(h f\right)^2 + \left(h f'\right)^2 - 2h^2 ff'\cos{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
which, after evaluating the square and canceling and rearranging terms, further  yields
:&lt;math&gt; 2 h f m_e c^2-2 h f' m_e c^2   = 2 h^2 f f' \left( 1 - \cos \theta \right).  &lt;/math&gt;
Dividing both sides by {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;2 h f f' m_e c&lt;/math&gt;}} yields
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{c}{f'} - \frac{c}{f} = \frac{h}{m_ec}\left(1-\cos \theta \right).   &lt;/math&gt;
:
Finally, since  {{math|''fλ''}} =  {{math|''f ' λ' ''}} = {{mvar|c}},
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda'-\lambda = \frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos{\theta})~. \qquad\qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;
:

It can further be seen that the angle {{mvar|φ}} of the outgoing electron with the direction of the incoming photon is specified by 
::&lt;math&gt; \cot \varphi = \left ( 1+\frac{hf}{m_e c^2} \right ) \tan (\theta/2)~.\qquad\qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Compton scattering ===
Compton scattering is of prime importance to [[radiobiology]], as it is the most probable interaction of gamma rays and high energy X-rays with atoms in living beings and is applied in [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In material physics, Compton scattering can be used to probe the [[wave function]] of the electrons in matter in the momentum representation.

Compton scattering is an important effect in [[gamma spectroscopy]] which gives rise to the [[Compton edge]], as it is possible for the gamma rays to scatter out of the detectors used. [[Compton suppression]] is used to detect stray scatter gamma rays to counteract this effect.

=== Magnetic Compton scattering ===
Magnetic Compton scattering is an extension of the previously mentioned technique which involves the magnetisation of a crystal sample hit with high energy, circularly polarised photons. By measuring the scattered photons' energy and reversing the magnetisation of the sample, two different Compton profiles are generated (one for spin up momenta and one for spin down momenta). Taking the difference between these two profiles gives the magnetic Compton profile  (MCP), given by &lt;math&gt;J_{\text{mag}}(\mathbf{p}_z)&lt;/math&gt; - a one-dimensional projection of the electron spin density.

&lt;math&gt;J_{\text{mag}}(\mathbf{p}_z) = \frac{1}{\mu}\iint_{-\infty}^\infty (n_{\uparrow} (\mathbf{p}) - n_{\downarrow}(\mathbf{p})) d\mathbf{p}_x d\mathbf{p}_y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the number of spin-unpaired electrons in the system, &lt;math&gt;n_\uparrow(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_\downarrow(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; are the three-dimensional electron momentum distributions for the majority spin and minority spin electrons respectively.

Since this scattering process is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] (there is no phase relationship between the scattered photons), the MCP is representative of the bulk properties of the sample and is a probe of the ground state. This means that the MCP is ideal for comparison with theoretical techniques such as [[density functional theory]].
The area under the MCP is directly proportional to the spin moment of the system and so, when combined with total moment measurements methods (such as [[SQUID]] magnetometry), can be used to isolate both the spin and orbital contributions to the total moment of a system.
The shape of the MCP also yields insight into the origin of the magnetism in the system.&lt;ref name="Cooper2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Cooper|title=X-Ray Compton Scattering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m58jXIJDs3QC|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=14 October 2004|publisher=[[OUP Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-850168-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverse Compton scattering ===
Inverse Compton scattering is important in [[astrophysics]].  In [[X-ray astronomy]], the [[accretion disk]] surrounding a [[black hole]] is presumed to produce a thermal spectrum.  The lower energy photons produced from this spectrum are scattered to higher energies by relativistic electrons in the surrounding [[corona]].  This is surmised to cause the power law component in the X-ray spectra (0.2-10 keV) of accreting Black Holes.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

The effect is also observed when photons from the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) move through the hot gas surrounding a [[galaxy cluster]].  The CMB photons are scattered to higher energies by the electrons in this gas, resulting in the [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]]. Observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect provide a nearly redshift-independent means of detecting galaxy clusters.

Some synchrotron radiation facilities scatter laser light off the stored electron beam.
This Compton backscattering produces high energy photons in the MeV to GeV range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.infn.it/~levisand/graal/graal.html |title=GRAAL home page |publisher=Lnf.infn.it |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently used for nuclear physics experiments.

'''DNA repair protein XRCC4''' also known as '''X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4''' or '''XRCC4''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the XRCC4 [[gene]]. In addition to humans, the XRCC4 protein is also expressed in many other [[metazoan]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and in [[plants]].&lt;ref name="pmid11029705"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West CE, Waterworth WM, Jiang Q, Bray CM | title = Arabidopsis DNA ligase IV is induced by gamma-irradiation and interacts with an Arabidopsis homologue of the double strand break repair protein XRCC4 | journal = Plant J. | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–78 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11029705 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00856.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 is one of several core [[protein]]s involved in the [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) pathway to repair  [[DNA]] [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double strand breaks]] (DSBs).&lt;ref name="pmid23345432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oksenych V, Kumar V, Liu X, Guo C, Schwer B, Zha S, Alt FW | title = Functional redundancy between the XLF and DNA-PKcs DNA repair factors in V(D)J recombination and nonhomologous DNA end joining | journal = Proc.

NHEJ requires two main components to achieve successful completion. The first component is the cooperative binding and [[phosphorylation]] of [[DCLRE1C|artemis]] by the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase ([[DNA-PKcs]]). Artemis cleaves the ends of damaged DNA to prepare it for [[ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]]. The second component involves the bridging of DNA to DNA Ligase IV ([[LIG4|LigIV]]), by XRCC4, with the aid of [[XLF (protein)|Cernunnos-XLF]]. DNA-PKcs and XRCC4 are anchored to [[Ku70]] / [[Ku80]] heterodimer, which are bound to the DNA ends.&lt;ref name="pmid22287571"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andres SN, Vergnes A, Ristic D, Wyman C, Modesti M, Junop M | title = A human XRCC4-XLF complex bridges DNA | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 1868–78 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22287571 | pmc = 3287209 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since XRCC4 is the key protein that enables interaction of LigIV to damaged DNA and therefore ligation of the ends, mutations in the XRCC4 gene were found to cause embryonic lethality in mice and developmental inhibition and [[immunodeficiency]] in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid22287571" /&gt; Furthermore, certain mutations in the XRCC4 gene are associated with an increased risk of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid23321468"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shao N, Jiang WY, Qiao D, Zhang SG, Wu Y, Zhang XX, Hua LX, Ding Y, Feng NH | title = An updated meta-analysis of XRCC4 polymorphisms and cancer risk based on 31 case-control studies | journal = Cancer Biomark | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–47 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23321468 | doi = 10.3233/CBM-120292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double strand breaks ==
{{main|double strand breaks}}
DSBs are mainly caused by free radicals generated from ionizing radiation in the environment and from by-products released continually during cellular metabolism.  DSBs that are not efficiently repaired may result in the loss of important protein coding genes and regulatory sequences required for gene expression necessary for the life of a cell.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15123782"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Bont R, van Larebeke N | title = Endogenous DNA damage in humans: a review of quantitative data | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–85 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15123782 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/geh025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DSBs that cannot rely on a newly copied sister chromosome generated by DNA replication to fill in the gap will go into the NHEJ pathway.  This method of repair is essential as it is a last resort to prevent loss of long stretches of the chromosome.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieber MR, Lu H, Gu J, Schwarz K | title = Flexibility in the order of action and in the enzymology of the nuclease, polymerases, and ligase of vertebrate non-homologous DNA end joining: relevance to cancer, aging, and the immune system | journal = Cell Res. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–33 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18087292 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2007.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NHEJ is also used to repair DSBs generated during [[V(D)J recombination]] when gene regions are rearranged to create the unique antigen binding sites of antibodies and T-cell receptors.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

=== Sources of DNA damage ===

DNA damage occurs very frequently and is generated from exposure to a variety of both exogenous and endogenous genotoxic sources.&lt;ref name="pmid15123782"/&gt;  One of these include [[ionizing radiation]], such as [[γ radiation]] and [[X-rays]], which ionize the deoxyribose groups in the DNA backbone and can induce DSBs.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Reactive oxygen species, [[Reactive Oxygen Species|ROS]], such as [[superoxide]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–{{•}}&lt;/sup&gt;), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[singlet oxygen]] (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), can also produce DSBs as a result of ionizing radiation as well as cellular metabolic processes that are naturally occurring.&lt;ref name="Reynolds_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynolds P, Anderson JA, Harper JV, Hill MA, Botchway SW, Parker AW, O'Neill P | title = The dynamics of Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs at DSBs induced by ionizing radiation is dependent on the complexity of damage | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 21 | pages = 10821–31 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23012265 | pmc = 3510491 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DSBs can also be caused by the action of [[DNA polymerase]] while attempting to [[DNA replication|replicate]] DNA over a [[Nick (DNA)|nick]] that was introduced as a result of DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15123782" /&gt;

=== Consequences of DSBs ===

There are many types of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]], but DSBs, in particular, are the most harmful as both strands are completely disjointed from the rest of the [[chromosome]].  If an efficient repair mechanism does not exist, the ends of the DNA can eventually degrade, leading to a permanent loss of sequence.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  A double-stranded gap in DNA will also prevent [[DNA replication|replication]] from proceeding, resulting in an incomplete copy of that specific [[chromosome]], targeting the cell for [[apoptosis]].  As with all DNA damage, DSBs can introduce new [[mutation]]s that can ultimately lead to [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15123782" /&gt;

=== DSB repair methods ===

There are two methods for repairing DSBs depending on when the damage occurs during [[mitosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid23345432" /&gt; If the DSB occurs after DNA replication has completed proceeding S phase of the [[cell cycle]], the [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DSB repair pathway]] will use [[homologous recombination]] by pairing with the newly synthesized daughter strand to repair the break.  However, if the DSB is generated prior to synthesis of the sister chromosome, then the template sequence that is required will be absent.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  For this circumstance, the [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ pathway]] provides a solution for repairing the break and is the main system used to repair DSBs in humans and multicellular eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid23345432" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22287571" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds_2012"/&gt;  During NHEJ, very short stretches of complementary DNA, 1 bp or more at a time, are hybridized together, and the overhangs are removed.  As a result, this specific region of the genome is permanently lost and the deletion can lead to cancer and premature aging.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber_2008"/&gt;

== Properties ==

=== Gene and protein ===

The human XRCC4 [[gene]] is located on [[chromosome 5]], specifically at 5q14.2.  This gene contains eight [[exons]] and three [[mRNA]] transcript variants, which encode two different [[protein isoforms]]. Transcript variant 1, mRNA, RefSeq NM_003401.3, is 1688 bp long and is the shortest out of the three variants. It is missing a short sequence in the 3’ [[coding region]] as compared to variant 2.  Isoform 1 contains 334 [[amino acid]]s.  Transcript variant 2, mRNA, RefSeq NM_022406, is 1694 bp long and encodes the longest isoform 2, which contains 336 [[amino acids]].  Transcript variant 3, RefSeq NM_022550.2, is 1735 bp and is the longest, but it also encodes for the same isoform 1 as variant 1. It contains an additional sequence in the 5’UTR of the mRNA transcript and lacks a short sequence in the 3’[[coding region]] as compared to variant 2.&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: XRCC4 X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 4 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=7518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

XRCC4 protein is a [[tetramer]] that resembles the shape of a dumbbell containing two globular ends separated by a long, thin stalk. The tetramer is composed of two [[protein dimer|dimers]], and each dimer is made up of two similar [[Protein subunit|subunit]]s. The first subunit (L) contains amino acid residues 1 – 203 and has a longer stalk than the second subunit (S) which contains residues 1 – 178.

The globular [[N-terminal]] domains of each subunit are identical. They are made up of two, antiparallel [[beta sheet]]s that face each other in a beta sandwich-like structure (i.e., a "flattened" [[beta barrel]]) and are separated by two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] on one side. The N-terminus begins with one beta sheet composed of strands 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by a [[helix-turn-helix]] motif of the two alpha helices, αA and αB, which continues into strands 5, 6, 7, and ending with one alpha-helical stalk at the [[C-terminus]].  αA and αB are perpendicular to one another, and because one end of αB is partially inserted between the two beta sheets, it causes them to flare out away from each other. The beta sandwich structure is held together through three hydrogen bonds between antiparallel strands 4 and 7 and one hydrogen bond between strands 1 and 5.

The two helical stalks between subunits L and S intertwine with a single left-handed crossover into a [[coiled-coil]] at the top, near the globular domains forming a palm tree configuration.  This region interacts with the two alpha helices of the second dimer in an opposite orientation to form a  [[Helix bundle#Four-helix bundles|four-helix bundle]] and the dumbbell-shaped tetramer.&lt;ref name="pmid11080143"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Junop MS, Modesti M, Guarné A, Ghirlando R, Gellert M, Yang W | title = Crystal structure of the Xrcc4 DNA repair protein and implications for end joining | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 19 | issue = 22 | pages = 5962–70 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11080143 | pmc = 305814 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/19.22.5962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-translational modifications ===

In order for XRCC4 to be sequestered from the [[cytoplasm]] to the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] to repair a DSB during NHEJ or to complete [[V(D)J recombination]], [[post-translational modification]] at [[lysine]] 210 with a small [[ubiquitin]]-related modifier (SUMO), or [[sumoylation]], is required.  SUMO modification of diverse types of DNA repair proteins can be found in [[topoisomerase]]s, base excision [[glycosylase]] TDG, Ku70/80, and BLM [[helicase]].  A common conserved motif is typically found to be a target of SUMO modification, ΨKXE (where Ψ is a bulky, [[hydrophobic]] [[amino acid]]).  In the case of the XRCC4 protein, the consensus sequence surrounding lysine 210 is IKQE.  [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, CHO, that express the mutated form of XRCC4 at K210 cannot be modified with SUMO, fail recruitment to the nucleus and instead accumulate in the cytoplasm.  Furthermore, these cells are [[radiation]] sensitive and do not successfully complete V(D)J recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid16478998" /&gt;

=== Interactions ===
[[File:Interaction of XRCC4 in NHEJ.jpg|thumb|Interaction of XRCC4 with other components of the NHEJ complex]]
Upon generation of a DSB, Ku proteins will move through the cytoplasm until they find the site of the break and bind to it.&lt;ref name="pmid17124166"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mari PO, Florea BI, Persengiev SP, Verkaik NS, Brüggenwirth HT, Modesti M, Giglia-Mari G, Bezstarosti K, Demmers JA, Luider TM, Houtsmuller AB, van Gent DC | title = Dynamic assembly of end-joining complexes requires interaction between Ku70/80 and XRCC4 | journal = Proc.

Cer-XLF is a homodimer that is very similar to XRCC4 in the structure and size of its [[N-terminal]] and [[C-terminal]] domains.  Residues [[arginine]] 64, [[leucine]] 65, and leucine 115 in Cer-XLF interact with lysines 65 and 99 in XRCC4 within their N-terminal domains.  Together they form a filament bundle that wraps around DNA in an alternating pattern.  Hyper-[[phosphorylation]] of the C-terminal alpha helical domains of XRCC4 by [[DNA-PKcs]] facilitates this interaction.  XRCC4 dimer binds to a second dimer on an adjacent DNA strand to create a tetramer for DNA bridging early on in NHEJ.  Prior to [[Covalent bond|ligation]], Lig IV binds to the C-terminal stalk of XRCC4 at the site of the break and displaces the second XRCC4 dimer.&lt;ref name="pmid22287571"/&gt;  The BRCT2 domain of Lig IV hydrogen bonds with XRCC4 at this domain through multiple residues and introduces a kink in the two alpha helical tails.

== Mechanism ==

=== NHEJ ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mechanism of non-homologous end joining for double-stranded DNA breaks MF.png|thumbnail|Mechanism of non-homologous end joining for repair of double-stranded DNA breaks]] --&gt;
The process of NHEJ involves XRCC4 and a number of tightly coupled proteins acting in concert to repair the DSB.  The system begins with the binding of one heterodimeric protein called Ku70/80 to each end of the DSB to maintain them close together in preparation for [[Covalent bond|ligation]] and prevent their degradation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodish&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodish|first=Harvey|title=Molecular Cell Biology|year=2013|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-3413-9|pages=1060–1061, 1068–1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ku70/80 then sequesters one DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to the DNA ends to enable the binding of Artemis protein to one end of each DNA-PKcs.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22287571" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19332554" /&gt;  One end of the DNA-PKcs joins to stabilize the proximity of the DSB and allow very short regions of DNA complementarity to hybridize.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22287571" /&gt;  DNA-PKcs then [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] Artemis at a [[serine]]/[[threonine]] to activate its [[exonuclease]] activity and cleave [[nucleotides]] at the single strand tails that are not hybridized in a 5’ to 3’ direction.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19332554" /&gt;  Two XRCC4 proteins are post-[[Translation (biology)|translationally]] modified for recognition and localization to Ku70/80 (5).  The two XRCC4 proteins dimerize together and bind to Ku70/80 at the ends of the DNA strands to promote ligation.  XRCC4 then forms a strong complex with DNA ligase IV, LigIV, which is enhanced by Cernunnos XRCC4-like factor, Cer-XLF.&lt;ref name="pmid22287571" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19332554" /&gt;  Cer-XLF only binds to XRCC4 without direct interaction with LigIV.  LigIV then joins the DNA ends by catalyzing a covalent [[phosphodiester bond]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19332554" /&gt;

=== V(D)J recombination ===

V(D)J recombination is the rearrangement of multiple, distinct [[gene]] segments in germ-line DNA to produce the unique protein domains of [[immune cells]], [[B cells]] and [[T cells]], that will specifically recognize foreign [[antigens]] such as [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], and [[pathogen]]ic eukaryotes.  B cells produce [[Antibody|antibodies]] that are secreted into the bloodstream and T cells produce receptors that once translated are transported to the outer [[lipid bilayer]] of the cell.  Antibodies are composed of two light and two heavy chains.  The antigen binding site consists of two variable regions, VL and VH.  The remainder of the antibody structure is made up of constant regions, CL, CH, CH2 and CH3.  The Kappa locus in the mouse encodes an antibody light chain and contains approximately 300 gene segments for the variable region, V, four J segments than encode a short protein region, and one constant, C, segment.  To produce a light chain with one unique type of VL, when B cells are differentiating, DNA is rearranged to incorporate a unique combination of the V and J segments.  RNA splicing joins the recombined region with the C segment.  The heavy chain gene also contain numerous diversity segments, D, and multiple constant segments, Cμ, Cδ, Cγ, Cε, Cα.  [[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] occurs in a specific region of the gene that is located between two conserved sequence motifs called recombination signal sequences.  Each motif is flanked by a 7 bp and 9 bp sequence that is separated by a 12 bp spacer, referred to as class 1, or a 23 bp spacer, referred to as class 2.  A [[recombinase]] made up of RAG1 and RAG2 subunits always cleave between these two sites.  The cleavage results in two [[Stem-loop|hairpin]] structures for the V and J segments, respectively, and the non-coding region, are now separated from the V and J segments by a DSB.  The hairpin coding region goes through the process of NHEJ where the closed end is cleaved and repaired.  The non-coding region is circularized and degraded.&lt;ref name="pmid23345432" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Thus, NHEJ is also important in the development of the immune system via its role in V(D)J recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid19514464"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popławski T, Stoczyńska E, Błasiak J | title = [Non-homologous DNA end joining--new proteins, new functions, new mechanisms] | language = Polish | journal = Postepy Biochem. | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–45 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19514464 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathology ==
Recent studies have shown an association between XRCC4 and potential susceptibility to a variety of pathologies.  The most frequently observed linkage is between XRCC4 mutations and susceptibility to cancers such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, and lymphomas.  Studies have also pointed to a potential linkage between XRCC4 mutation and endometriosis. Autoimmunity is also being studied in this regard.  Linkage between XRCC4 mutations and certain pathologies may provide a basis for diagnostic biomarkers and, eventually, potential development of new therapeutics.

=== Cancer susceptibility ===

XRCC4 [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s have been linked to a risk of susceptibility for cancers such as [[bladder cancer]],&lt;ref name="Mittal_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mittal RD, Gangwar R, Mandal RK, Srivastava P, Ahirwar DK | title = Gene variants of XRCC4 and XRCC3 and their association with risk for urothelial bladder cancer | journal = Mol.

The linkage with risk for urothelial bladder cancer susceptibility was shown for XRCC4, but not for XRCC3&lt;ref name="Mittal_2012" /&gt;   With regard to breast cancer, the linkage with "increased risk of breast cancer" was based on an examination of functional polymorphisms of the XRCC4 gene carried out in connection with a meta-analysis of five case-control studies .&lt;ref name="pmid22994773" /&gt;  There is also at least one hospital-based case-control histological study indicating that polymorphisms in XRCC4 may have an "influence" on prostate cancer susceptibility.&lt;ref name="Mandal_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandal RK, Singh V, Kapoor R, Mittal RD | title = Do polymorphisms in XRCC4 influence prostate cancer susceptibility in North Indian population? | journal = Biomarkers | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–42 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21506695 | doi = 10.3109/1354750X.2010.547599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditional (CD21-cre-mediated) deletion of the XRCC4 NHEJ gene in [[p53]]-deficient peripheral mouse [[B cell]]s resulted in surface Ig-negative B-cell lymphomas, and these lymphomas often had a "reciprocal chromosomal translocation" fusing [[IgH]] to [[Myc]] (and also had "large chromosomal deletions or translocations" involving [[IGK@|IgK]] or [[immunoglobulin light chain|IgL]], with IgL "fusing" to oncogenes or to [[IgH]]).&lt;ref name="Wang_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang JH, Alt FW, Gostissa M, Datta A, Murphy M, Alimzhanov MB, Coakley KM, Rajewsky K, Manis JP, Yan CT | title = Oncogenic transformation in the absence of Xrcc4 targets peripheral B cells that have undergone editing and switching | journal = J.

===Senescence===

Declining ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks by [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ]] may be a significant factor in the [[aging]] process.  Li et al.&lt;ref name="pmid27391797"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Z, Zhang W, Chen Y, Guo W, Zhang J, Tang H, Xu Z, Zhang H, Tao Y, Wang F, Jiang Y, Sun FL, Mao Z |title=Impaired DNA double-strand break repair contributes to the age-associated rise of genomic instability in humans |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1765–1777 |year=2016 |pmid=27391797 |doi=10.1038/cdd.2016.65 |pmc=5071568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that, in humans, the efficiency of NHEJ repair declines from age 16 to 75 years.  Their study indicated that decreased expression of XRCC4 and other NHEJ proteins drives an age-associated decline in NHEJ efficiency and fidelity.  They suggested that the age related decline in expression of XRCC4 may contribute to cellular senescence.

=== Autoimmunity ===

Based on the findings that (1) several polypeptides in the NHEJ pathway are "potential targets of autoantibodies" and (2) "one of the autoimmune epitopes in XRCC4 coincides with a sequence that is a nexus for radiation-induced regulatory events", it has been suggested that exposure to DNA double-strand break-introducing agents "may be one of the factors" mediating autoimmune responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KJ, Dong X, Wang J, Takeda Y, Dynan WS | title = Identification of human autoantibodies to the DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex and mapping of an autoimmune epitope to a potential regulatory region | journal = J.

=== Endometriosis susceptibility ===
There has been speculation that "XRCC4 codon 247*A and XRCC4 promoter -1394*T related genotypes and alleles . . . might be associated with higher endometriosis susceptibilities and pathogenesis".&lt;ref name="pmid18246529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsieh YY, Bau DT, Chang CC, Tsai CH, Chen CP, Tsai FJ | title = XRCC4 codon 247*A and XRCC4 promoter -1394*T related genotypes but not XRCC4 intron 3 gene polymorphism are associated with higher susceptibility for endometriosis | journal = Mol.

=== Potential use as a cancer biomarker ===

In view of the possible associations of XRCC4 polymorphisms with risk of cancer susceptibility (see discussion above), XRCC4 could be used as a [[biomarker]] for [[cancer screening]], particularly with respect to prostate cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer.&lt;ref name="Mittal_2012"/&gt;  In fact, XRCC4 polymorphisms were specifically identified as having the potential to be novel useful markers for "primary prevention and anticancer intervention" in the case of urothelial bladder cancer.&lt;ref name="Mittal_2012"/&gt;

=== Radiosensitization of tumor cells ===

In view of the role of XRCC4 in [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-strand break repair]], the relationship between impaired XRCC4 function and the [[radiosensitizer|radiosensitization]] of tumor cells has been investigated.  For instance, it has been reported that "[[RNAi]]-mediated targeting of noncoding and coding sequences in DNA repair gene messages efficiently radiosensitizes human tumor cells".&lt;ref name="pmid22237628"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zheng Z, Ng WL, Zhang X, Olson JJ, Hao C, Curran WJ, Wang Y | title = RNAi-mediated targeting of noncoding and coding sequences in DNA repair gene messages efficiently radiosensitizes human tumor cells | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1221–8 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22237628 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential role in therapeutics ===

There has been discussion in the literature comcerning the potential role of XRCC4 in the development of novel therapeutics.  For instance, Wu ''et al.'' have suggested that since the XRCC4 gene is "critical in NHEJ" and is "positively associated with cancer susceptibility", some XRCC4 SNPs such as G-1394T (rs6869366) "may serve as a common SNP for detecting and predict[ing] various cancers (so far for breast, gastric and prostate cancers . . .)"; and, although further investigation is needed, "they may serve as candidate targets for personalized anticancer drugs".&lt;ref name="Wu_2008"/&gt;  The possibility of detecting endometriosis on this basis has also been mentioned, and this may also possibly lead to the eventual development of treatments.&lt;ref name="Wu_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18246529"/&gt;  In evaluating further possibilites for anticancer treatments, Wu ''et al''. also commented on the importance of “co-treatments of DNA-damaging agents and radiation”.&lt;ref name="Wu_2008"/&gt;  Specifically, Wu ''et al''. noted that the “balance between DNA damage and capacity of DNA repair mechanisms determines the final therapeutic outcome” and “the capacity of cancer cells to complete DNA repair mechanisms is important for therapeutic resistance and has a negative impact upon therapeutic efficacy”, and thus theorized that “[p]harmacological inhibition of recently detected targets of DNA repair with several small-molecule compounds . . . . has the potential to enhance the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents”.&lt;ref name="Wu_2008"/&gt;

=== Microcephalic primordial dwarfism ===

== History==

Research carried out in the 1980s revealed that a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant called XR-1 was "extremely sensitive" with regard to being killed by gamma rays during the G1 portion of the cell cycle but, in the same research studies, showed "nearly normal resistance" to gamma-ray damage during the late S phase;&lt;ref name="Giaccia 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giaccia A, Weinstein R, Hu J, Stamato TD | title = Cell cycle-dependent repair of double-strand DNA breaks in a gamma-ray-sensitive Chinese hamster cell | journal = Somat.

[[File:Schema of the layers of the graphical user interface.svg|thumb|300px|The basic components of a [[graphical user interface|GUI]]: The '''display server''' implements the [[windowing system]]. A simple [[window manager]] merely draws the [[window decoration]]s, but compositing window managers do more.]]

A '''display server''' or '''window server''' is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a [[communications protocol]], which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable.

The display server is a key component in any [[graphical user interface]], specifically the [[windowing system]].

== Available display server communications protocols ==

=== X11 ===
{{Main article|X Window System core protocol|X Window System}}
[[File:X11 display server protocol.svg|thumb|350px|The [[X.Org Server]] communicates with its clients, e.g. [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], over the X11 protocol]]
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:X11.svg|right|60px|X Window System logo]]&lt;/div&gt;

One example of a display server is the [[X.Org Server]], which runs on top of the kernel (usually a [[Unix]]-based kernel, such as [[Linux]] or [[BSD]]). It receives user input data (e.g. from [[evdev]] on Linux) and passes it to one of its clients. The display server also receives data from its clients; it processes the data, it does the compositing and on Linux it passes the data to one of three kernel components &amp;ndash; [[Direct Rendering Manager|DRM]], [[Graphics Execution Manager|gem]] or [[KMS driver]]. The component writes the data into the [[framebuffer]] and content of the framebuffer is transmitted to the connected screen and displayed. X relies on [[GLX]].

One of the implementations of display server concept is [[X Window System]], in particular its actually used version &amp;ndash; [[X.Org Server]] and [[Xlib]] and [[XCB]] client libraries. The X.Org Server is a display server, but in its current implementation it relies on a second program, the [[compositing window manager]], to do the compositing. Examples are [[Mutter (window manager)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]].

Notable examples of display servers implementing the X11 display server protocol are [[X.Org Server]], [[XFree86]], [[XQuartz]] and [[Cygwin/X]], while client libraries implementing the X11 display server protocol are [[Xlib]] and [[XCB]].

One tool called &lt;tt&gt;[[xev (unix)|xev]]&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[Unix command]] which creates a window and then asks the display server to send information of events every time something happens to the window (like if it's resized, if any keys are pushed, if it's clicked it etc.) to the console.

=== Wayland ===
{{Main article|Wayland (display server protocol)}}
[[File:Wayland display server protocol.svg|thumb|300px|The Wayland display server protocol]]
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:Wayland Logo.svg|right|60px|Wayland logo]]&lt;/div&gt;

Display servers that implement the Wayland display server protocol, are called [[Wayland compositor]]s. Like any display server, a Wayland compositor is responsible for handling input and output for its clients and – in contrast to X11 – additionally for the [[compositing]]. Examples are [[Weston (software)|Weston]], [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]], [[KWin]] or [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]].

Wayland compositors communicate with Wayland clients over the [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland display server protocol]]. This protocol defines that clients can directly write data into the framebuffer using the [[EGL (OpenGL)|EGL]] [[rendering API]]. The display server still gets to decide which window is on top and thus visible to the user and also still is responsible for passing data regarding to input devices from [[evdev]] to its clients.

Wayland is used to a certain degree in some Linux desktop distributions, such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2016/03/04/why-wayland-anyway/ | title = Why Wayland Anyway? | work = Goings On | publisher = Matthias Clasen | accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also well suited for mobile computing and has been adopted, for example, by the smartphone- and tablet-focused projects [[Tizen]] and [[Sailfish OS]].

An implementation of Wayland is available under the [[MIT License]], the [[libwayland-client]] and libwayland-server libraries.

There is an ongoing effort to add Wayland support to [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ozone_overview.md | title = Ozone Overview | accessdate = 2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mir ===
{{Main article|Mir (display server)}}

The [[Mir (software)|Mir display server]] comes with its own Mir display server protocol which is different from those used by X11 and Wayland. Mir additionally supports the X11 protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://samohtv.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/mir-an-outpost-envisioned-as-a-new-home/|title=[Updated] Mir – An outpost envisioned as a new home|last=ThomasVo5|date=2013-03-04|website=tvoss@work|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] and was intended to be the display server of choice for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. As of 2017, it has been replaced with the Wayland display server for desktop editions of Ubuntu.

There are implementations of the Mir display server, the libmir-server and the libmir-client libraries available under the [[GPLv3]].

=== SurfaceFlinger ===
For [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (another Linux kernel-based operating system primarily for mobile devices) [[Google]] developed a display server called SurfaceFlinger:&lt;ref name="Android system architecture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://androidteam.googlecode.com/files/Anatomy-Physiology-of-an-Android.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408053917/http://androidteam.googlecode.com/files/Anatomy-Physiology-of-an-Android.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-08 |title=Android system architecture |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything in Android is rendered to a "surface"; "surfaces" are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by SurfaceFlinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Surface.html |title=Android Developer: Surface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://source.android.com/devices/graphics/arch-sf-hwc.html |title=Android Developer: SurfaceFlinger and Hardware Composer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another Android-specific solution is "Gralloc". Gralloc handles device memory i.e. it does allocation, arbitration, it handles synchronization via Android/Linux fence file descriptors (FDs). Gralloc competes with other solutions like e.g. Mesa's [[Generic Buffer Management]] (GBM) or Nvidia's EGLStreams. The gralloc hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is used to allocate the buffers that underlie "surfaces".

For compositing in Android, Surfaces are sent to SurfaceFlinger, which uses OpenGL ES to do the compositing.

Hardware Composer HAL (HWC) was introduced in Android 3.0 and has evolved steadily over the years. Its primary purpose is to determine the most efficient way to composite buffers with the available hardware. As a HAL, its implementation is device-specific and usually done by the display hardware OEM.

=== Quartz Compositor ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Quartz2D.png|right|60px|[[Quartz 2D]] logo]] --&gt;

For Apple's [[macOS]] family of operating systems, [[Quartz Compositor]] fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the [[windowing system]]. 

=== Desktop Window Manager ===
For [[Microsoft Windows]], from [[Windows Vista]] onward, [[Desktop Window Manager]] enables the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface. It was originally created to enable portions of the new "Windows Aero" user experience, which allowed for effects such as transparency, 3D window switching and more. It is also included with Windows Server 2008, but requires the "Desktop Experience" feature and compatible graphics drivers to be installed.

The '''NSF Engineering Research Center for Wireless Integrated Microsystems''' ('''ERC WIMS''') was formed in 2000 in [[Michigan]] — through the collaboration of the [[University of Michigan]] (UM), [[Michigan State University]] (MSU), and [[Michigan Technological University]]. 

The center is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Additional contributions came from the state of [[Michigan]], the three partnering core universities, other federal agencies, and a consortium of about twenty companies. 

==Purpose==
The center researches innovations for  [[wireless integrated microsystems]]s. The ERC WIMS works on merging micropower circuits, wireless interfaces, biomedical, and environmental sensors and subsystems, and advanced packaging to create microsystems that will have a pervasive impact on society during the next two decades.

The partnership combined UM's programs in sensors and microsystems with MSU's leadership in materials, especially in [[diamond]] and in [[carbon nanotube]]s, and Michigan Tech's expertise in [[packaging]], micromilling, and hot [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70298">{{For|the condition characterized by [[comorbidity]] of a specific set of impairments to executive functioning|Dysexecutive syndrome}}

In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], '''executive dysfunction''', or '''executive function deficit''', is a disruption to the efficacy of the [[executive functions]], which is a group of [[cognitive processes]] that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction can refer to both [[neurocognitive]] deficits and behavioural [[symptom]]s. It is implicated in numerous [[Psychopathology#As a descriptive term|psychopathologies]] and [[mental disorder]]s, as well as short-term and long-term changes in non-clinical executive control.

Executive dysfunction is not the same as [[dysexecutive syndrome]], a term coined by [[Alan Baddeley]] to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions, such as deficiencies in [[planning]], abstract thinking, [[Cognitive flexibility|flexibility]] and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;Wilson, B.A., Evans, J.J., Emslie, H., Alderman, N., &amp; Burgess, P. (1998). The development of an ecologically valid test for assessing patients with a dysexecutive syndrome. ''Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 8'', 213-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Baddeley, A."&gt;Baddeley, A., &amp; Wilson, B. (1988). Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome. ''Brain and Cognition, 7'', 212-230.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of symptoms, usually resulting from brain damage, tend to occur together.&lt;ref&gt;Halligan, P.W., Kischka, U., &amp; Marshall, J.C. (2004). ''Handbook of clinical neuropsychology.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of dysexecutive syndrome is [[Dysexecutive syndrome#Controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Stuss et. al"&gt;Stuss, D.T. &amp; Alexander, M.P. (2007). Is there a dysexecutive syndrome? ''Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 362'' (1481), 901-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Executive functioning]] is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Executive processes are integral to higher [[brain function]], particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, [[self-monitoring]], [[attention]], response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.&lt;ref name="Jurado Rosselli"&gt;Jurado MB, Rosselli M (2007). The elusive nature of executive functions: a review of our current understanding. Neuropsychol Rev, 17(3):213–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.

Executive dysfunction does occur to a minor degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control.&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2007"&gt;Schmeichel, BJ (2007). Attention Control, memory updating, and emotion regulation temporarily reduce the capacity for executive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136(2):241–55&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging.&lt;ref name="Zelazo et al"&gt;Zelazo PD, Craik FI, Booth L (2004). Executive function across the life span. Acta Psychol (Amst), 115 (2–3):167–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Bisiacchi"&gt;Bisiacchi PS, Borella E, Bergamaschi S, Carretti B, Mondini S (2008). Interplay between memory and executive functions in normal and pathological aging. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 30(6):723–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction appears to consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive control in the inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation.&lt;ref name="Nieuwen"&gt;Nieuwenhuis S, Broerse A, Nielen MM, de Jong R (2004). A goal activation approach to the study of executive function: an application to antisaccade tasks. Brain Cogn. 56(2):198–214. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"/&gt; Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;Avila C, Barros A, Ortet G, Parcet MA &amp; Ibanez M I (2003). Set-shifting and sensitivity to reward: A possible dopamine mechanism for explaining disinhibitory disorders. Cognition and Emotion, 17, 951–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and [[aggressive behaviour]] in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in [[working memory]] capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[hyperemotionality]].&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2008"&gt;Schmeichel BJ, Volokhov RN &amp; Demaree HA (2008). Working memory capacity and the Self-Regulation of Emotional Expression and Experience" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 95(6), 1526–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Barkley]] proposed a hybrid model of the role of behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;

Other common and distinctive symptoms of executive dysfunction include utilization behaviour, which is compulsive manipulation/use of nearby objects due simply to their presence and accessibility (rather than a functional reason); and [[imitation]] behaviour, a tendency to rely on imitation as a primary means of [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann MW, &amp; Bill PLA (1992). The environmental dependency syndrome, imitation behaviour and utilization behaviour as presenting symptoms of bilateral frontal lobe infarction due to moyamoya disease. South African Medical Journal, 81(5): 271–73&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that executive set shifting is a co-mediator with [[episodic memory]] of [[Children's use of information#Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)|feeling-of-knowing]] (FOK) accuracy, such that executive dysfunction may reduce FOK accuracy.&lt;ref name="Perrotin"&gt;Perrotin A, Tournell L, Isingrini M (2008). Executive functioning and memory as potential mediators of the episodic feeling-of-knowing accuracy" ''Brain and Cognition'' 67:76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=A |last2=Windmann |first2=S |last3=McKenna |first3=P |last4=Güntürkün |first4=O |date=May 2007 |title=Creative thinking in schizophrenia: the role of executive dysfunction and symptom severity |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17453904 |doi=10.1080/13546800601046714}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm [[etiology]] for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of [[psychosis]] are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/[[schizotypy]] due to [[dopamine]] overlap.&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;Keshavan MS, Sujata M, Mehra A, Montrose DM, Sweeney JA (2003). Psychosis proneness and ADHD in young relatives of schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia Research, 59(1), 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of executive dysfunction is heterogeneous,&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"&gt;Nigg JT (2006). What causes ADHD?: Understanding what goes wrong and why. New York, NY: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-267-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[neurocognitive]] processes are involved in the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory play a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.

Executive processes are closely integrated with memory retrieval capabilities for overall cognitive control; in particular, goal/task-information is stored in both short-term and long-term memory, and effective performance requires effective storage and retrieval of this information.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"&gt;Verbruggen F, Logan GD. (2008). Long-term aftereffects of response inhibition: memory retrieval, task goals, and cognitive control. J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 34(5):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction characterizes many of the symptoms observed in numerous [[#Executive dysfunction in clinical populations|clinical populations]]. In the case of [[acquired brain injury]] and neurodegenerative diseases there is a clear neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, [[syndromes]] and [[Mental disorder|disorders]] are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson's disease, a [[neurodegenerative]] condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as [[ADHD|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
As previously mentioned, executive functioning is not a unitary concept.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] brain regions.&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark C, Gallo J, Glosser G, Grossman M (2002). Memory encoding and retrieval in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychology. 16(2); 190–96&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported to some extent by the primary literature, which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berquin 1998"&gt;Berquin PC, Giedd JN, Jacobsen LK, Hamburger SD, Krain AL, Rapoport JL, Castellanos FX (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study" ''Neurology'' 50, 1087–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases of executive dysfunction, deficits are attributed to either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter P, Just M &amp; Reichle E (2000). Working memory and executive function: evidence from neuroimaging. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. 10; 195–99&lt;/ref&gt; Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be the primary site of cortical activation during these tasks.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"&gt;Dougherty D, Ottowitz W, Savage C (2002). Neural network basis for abnormalities of attention and executive function in major depressive disorder: implications for application of the medical disease model to psychiatric disorders. Harvard Review of Psychology. 10(2); 86–99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson's disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the [[globus pallidus]]&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; and appear to be the genuine result of [[basal ganglia]] damage.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt;

With substantial cognitive load, fMRI signals indicate a common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Caparelli E, Chang L, Ernst T et al. (2006). Different activation patterns for working memory load and visual attention load. Brain Research. 158–65&lt;/ref&gt; This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both a direct and an indirect circuit.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the [[striatum]] and [[thalamus]] to return to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt;

Not surprisingly, plaques and tangles in the frontal cortex can cause disruption in functions as well as damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Clark"/&gt; Another important point is in the finding that structural [[MRI]] images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner, R. (2004). Memory and executive function in aging and AD: multiple factors that cause decline and reserve factors that compensate" ''Neuron'' 44;195–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging view suggests that cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt; A challenge for future research will be to map the multiple brain regions that might combine with each other in a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Certain genes have been identified with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;Friedman, et al (2008). Individual differences in executive functions are almost entirely genetic in origin. Journal of experimental psychology, 137(2), 201–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene ([[DRD4]]) with 7'-repeating [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD.&lt;ref name="Langley 2004"&gt;Langley K, Marshall L, Bree M van den, Thomas H, Owen M, O'Donovan M, Thapar A (2004). Association of the dopamine D4 receptor gene 7-repeat allele with neuropsychological test performance of children with ADHD" ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 161(1),133–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene ([[COMT]]) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting&lt;ref name="Tunbridge"&gt;Tunbridge EM, Bannerman DM, Sharp T, Harrison PJ (2004). Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition improves set-shifting performance and elevates stimulated dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex" ''Journal of Neuroscience'' 24(23):5331–35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Sengupta 2008"&gt;Sengupta S, Grizenko N, Schmitz N, Schwartz G, Bellingham J, Polotskaia A, Stepanian MT, Goto Y, Grace AA, Joober R (2008).

Neuroscience Behaviour Physiology, 37(7), 643–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and measurement ==
There are several measures that can be employed to assess the executive functioning capabilities of an individual. Although a trained non-professional working outside of an institutionalized setting can legally and competently perform many of these measures, a trained professional administering the test in a standardized setting will yield the most accurate results.&lt;ref name ="Daghar"&gt;Daghar A, Monchi O, Petre V et al (2001). "Wisconsin card revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging." ''The Journal of Neuroscience'' 21(19)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock drawing test ===
The Clock drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive task that can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits.&lt;ref name ="Shulman"&gt;Shulman, K (2000). Clock drawing: Is it the ideal cognitive screening test? International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 15(6); 548–61&lt;/ref&gt; Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.&lt;ref&gt;Emond J, Galasko D, Hanson L. et al (2008). Spatial deficits predict rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-verified dementia with lewy bodies. Neuropsychology. 22(6); 729–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of the CDT begins with the instruction to the participant to draw a clock reading a specific time (generally 11:10). After the task is complete, the test administrator draws a clock with the hands set at the same specific time. Then the patient is asked to copy the image.&lt;ref name ="Jeste"&gt;Jeste DV, Legendre SA, Rice VA, et al (2004). "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients." Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology. 17(190)&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in clock drawing are classified according to the following categories: omissions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, distortions, substitutions and additions.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; Memory, concentration, initiation, energy, mental clarity and indecision are all measures that are scored during this activity.&lt;ref name ="Damasio"&gt;Damasio H, Rudrauf D, Tranel D, Vianna E (2008). Does the clock drawing test have focal neuroanatomical correlates? Neuropsychology. 22(5); 553–62&lt;/ref&gt; Those with deficits in executive functioning will often make errors on the first clock but not the second.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; In other words, they will be unable to generate their own example, but will show proficiency in the copying task.

=== Stroop task ===
The cognitive mechanism involved in the [[Stroop task]] is referred to as directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"&gt;Biederam J, Faraone S, Monutaeux M, et al (2000). Neuropsychological functioning in nonreferred siblings of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder" ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 109(2); 252–65&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word "red" is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say "blue" when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod C (1991). Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: An integrative review" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 109(20); 163–203&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;de Young R (2009)." Stroop task: A test of capacity to direct attention." EPLab: Measures. University of Michigan; http://www.snre.umich.edu/eplab/demos/st0/stroopdesc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin card sorting test ===
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]] (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; These abilities are primarily determined by the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are crucial components of executive functioning;&lt;ref&gt;Andermahr I, Gaser C, Hager F et al (1996). Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting test—a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. 75(3); 145–57&lt;/ref&gt; making the WCST a good measure for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The WCST utilizes a deck of 128 cards that contains four stimulus cards.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages 9 and 11 are able to show the cognitive flexibility that is needed for this test.&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkham|first=N.

=== Trail-making test ===
Another prominent test of executive dysfunction is known as the [[Trail-making test]]. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A &amp; Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"&gt;Arbuthnott K, Frank J (2000). Trail making test, Part B as a measure of executive control: validation using a set-switching paradigm. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 22(4); 518–28&lt;/ref&gt; Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant's objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudino E, Geisler M, Squires N (1995). Construct validity in the trail making test: What makes part B harder? Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 17(4); 529–35&lt;/ref&gt; The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing.&lt;ref name ="Conn"&gt;Conn H (1977). Trail-making and number-connection tests in the assessment of mental state in portal systemic encephalopathy. Digestive Diseases. 22(6); 541–50&lt;/ref&gt; Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"/&gt; Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.&lt;ref name ="Conn"/&gt;

== In clinical populations ==
The executive system's broad range of functions relies on, and is instrumental in, a broad range of neurocognitive processes. Clinical presentation of severe executive dysfunction that is unrelated to a specific disease or disorder is classified as a [[Dysexecutive Syndrome|dysexecutive syndrome]], and often appears following damage to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Chan 2001"&gt;Chan, RC. (2001). Dysexecutive symptoms among a non-clinical sample: a study with the use of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. British Journal of Psychology, Aug., 92 (pt 3):551–65.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Executive dysfunction is implicated [[etiology|etiologically]] and/or [[co-morbidity|co-morbidly]] in many psychiatric illnesses, which often show the same symptoms as the dysexecutive syndrome. It has been assessed and researched extensively in relation to cognitive developmental disorders, [[psychotic disorders]], [[affective disorders]], and [[conduct disorder]]s, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI).

Environmental dependency syndrome is a dysexecutive syndrome marked by significant behavioural dependence on environmental cues and is marked by excessive imitation and utilization behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"&gt;Lhermitte F (1986). Human autonomy and the frontal lobes. Part II: Patient behavior in complex and social situations: the "environmental dependency syndrome" ''Annals of Neurology'' 19(4):335–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in patients with a variety of etiologies including ABI, exposure to phendimetrazine tartrate,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann 2007"&gt;Hoffmann M (2007). Transient environmental dependency syndrome due to phendimetrazine tartrate. Eur Neurol, 58(1):49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; stroke, and various frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[Schizophrenia]] is commonly described as a mental disorder in which a person becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"/&gt; Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[amnesia]] for portions of their [[episodic memory]]. Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, [[implicit memory]] is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate spared performance on measures of visual and verbal attention and concentration, as well as on immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name ="Oram"&gt;Oram J, Geffen GM, Geffen LB, Kavanaugh DJ &amp; McGrath JJ (2005). Executive control of working memory in schizophrenia" ''Psychiatry Research'' 135, 8190&lt;/ref&gt; However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function. Working memory and multi-tasking impairments typically characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"/&gt; Persons with schizophrenia also tend to demonstrate deficits in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Thoma &amp; Duam"&gt;Thoma P &amp; Duam I (2008). Working memory and multi-tasking in [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with and without comorbid substance use disorder" ''Addiction'' 103, 774–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients often demonstrate noticeable deficits in the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch]]. However, performance on tasks associated with the [[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]] are typically less affected.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Radvasnky"&gt;Radvansky GA (2006). Human Memory. United States of America: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the visuospatial system is required for central executive control.&lt;ref name ="Oram"/&gt; The phonological system appears to be more generally spared overall.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characterize attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with [[ADHD]] often experience problems with organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"&gt;Marchetta N, Hurks P, Krabbendam L &amp; Jolles J (2008). Interference control, working memory, concept shifting, and verbal fluency in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Neruopsychology, 22(1), 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; In both children and adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and verbal fluency.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"&gt;Barkley RA (1997). Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 121(1), 65–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"&gt;Rosenman S (2006). Reconsidering the attention deficit paradigm. Australasian Psychiatry, 14(2), 127–32&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; However, some research has suggested the possibility that the severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.

Although ADHD has typically been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it has also been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits.&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output).&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
[[Autism]] is diagnosed based on the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. It is a disorder that is defined according to behaviour as no specific biological markers are known.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt; Due to the variability in severity and impairment in functioning exhibited by persons with autism, the disorder is typically conceptualized as existing along a continuum (or spectrum) of severity.

Individuals with autism commonly show impairment in three main areas of executive functioning:&lt;ref name ="Barnard"&gt;Barnard L, Muldoon K, Hasan R, O'Brien G &amp; Stewart M (2008). Profiling executive dysfunction in adults with autism and comorbid learning disability. Autism, 12(2), 125–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gilotty"&gt;Gilotty L, Kenworthy L, Sirian L, Black D &amp; Wagner A (2002). Adaptive skills and executive function in autism spectrum disorders. Child Neuropsychology, 8(4), 241–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"&gt;Firestone P &amp; Dozois JA (2007). Abnormal Psychology: Perspectives (3rd edition.). Toronto: Pearson Education Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"&gt;Hill EL (2004). Executive dysfunction in autism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(1), 26–32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluency.''' Fluency refers to the ability to generate novel ideas and responses. Although adult populations are largely underrepresented in this area of research, findings have suggested that children with autism generate fewer novel words and ideas and produce less complex responses than matched controls.
* '''Planning.''' Planning refers to a complex, dynamic process, wherein a sequence of planned actions must be developed, monitored, re-evaluated and updated. Persons with autism demonstrate impairment on tasks requiring planning abilities relative to typically functioning controls, with this impairment maintained over time. As might be suspected, in the case of autism comorbid with learning disability, an additive deficit is observed in many cases.
* '''Flexibility.''' Poor mental flexibility, as demonstrated in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested that individuals with autism experience a sort of 'stuck-in-set' perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.

Although there has been some debate, inhibition is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism.&lt;ref name ="Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; However, performance on the [[Stroop task]], for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.

In general, individuals with autism show relatively spared performance on tasks that do not require [[mentalization]].&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: use of desire and emotion words, sequencing behavioural pictures, and the recognition of basic facial emotional expressions. In contrast, individuals with autism typically demonstrated impaired performance on tasks that do require mentalizing.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: false beliefs, use of belief and idea words, sequencing [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] pictures, and recognizing complex emotions such as admiring or scheming.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
[[Bipolar disorder]] is a mood disorder that is characterized by both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months).&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt; Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"&gt;Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, Goswami U, Young AH, Ferrier IN &amp; Moore PB (2006). A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder" ''Journal of Affective Disorders'' 93, 105–15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally,&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt; indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt;

Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Glahn"&gt;Glahn DC, Bearden CE, Barguil M, Barrett J, Reichenberg A, Bowden CL, Soars JC &amp; Velligan DI (2007). The neurocognitive signature of psychotic bipolar disorder. Journal of Biology Psychiatry, 62, 910–16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It has been suggested that a "stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [of the brain] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder".&lt;ref name ="Dixon"&gt;Dixon T, Kravariti E, Frith C, Murray RM &amp; McGuire PK (2004). Effect of symptoms on executive function in bipolar illness" ''Psychological Medicine'' 34, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the [[formal thought disorder]] that is a feature of mania.&lt;ref name ="Dixon"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of [[psychosis]] demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis&lt;ref name ="Glahn"/&gt; suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) primarily involves damage to subcortical brain structures and is usually associated with movement difficulties, in addition to problems with memory and thought processes.&lt;ref name ="Ward"&gt;Ward J (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Persons affected by PD often demonstrate difficulties in [[working memory]], a component of executive functioning. Cognitive deficits found in early PD process appear to involve primarily the fronto-executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"&gt;Schneider JS (2007). Behavioral persistence deficit in Parkinson's disease patients. Journal of Neurology, 14, 300–04&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies of the role of dopamine in the cognition of PD patients have suggested that PD patients with inadequate dopamine supplementation are more impaired in their performance on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Grossman"&gt;Grossman M, Lee C, Morris J, Stern MB &amp; Hurtig H (2002). Assessing resource demands during sentence processing in Parkinson's disease. Brain and Language, 80, 603–16&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that dopamine may contribute to executive control processes. Increased distractibility, problems in set formation and maintaining and shifting attentional sets, deficits in executive functions such as self-directed planning, problems solving, and working memory have been reported in PD patients.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt; In terms of working memory specifically, persons with PD show deficits in the areas of: a) spatial working memory; b) [[central executive]] aspects of working memory; c) loss of [[episodic memories]]; d) locating events in time.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grossman"/&gt;

'''Spatial working memory.'''
PD patients often demonstrate difficulty in updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not keep track of spatial contextual information in the same way that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations of objects that they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.

'''Central executive aspects.'''
PD is often characterized by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one's stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may be more appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of a higher level of difficulty.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt;

'''Loss of episodic memories.'''
The loss of episodic memories in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories are generally more preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson's than in [[Alzheimer's]], the opposite is true for event data memories.

'''Locating events in time.'''
PD patients often demonstrate deficits in their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.

=== Treatment ===

==== Psychosocial treatment ====
Since 1997 there has been experimental and clinical practice of psychosocial treatment for adults with executive dysfunction, and particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychosocial treatment addresses the many facets of executive difficulties, and as the name suggests, covers academic, occupational and social deficits. Psychosocial treatment facilitates marked improvements in major symptoms of executive dysfunction such as time management, organization and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ramsay Rostain 2007"&gt;Ramsay JR &amp; Rostain AL (2007). Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults: Current status and future directions. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(6), 624–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive-behavioral therapy and group rehabilitation ====
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) is a frequently suggested treatment for executive dysfunction, but has shown limited effectiveness. However, a study of CBT in a group rehabilitation setting showed a significant increase in positive treatment outcome compared with individual therapy. Patients' self-reported symptoms on 16 different ADHD/executive-related items were reduced following the treatment period.&lt;ref name="Virta 2008"&gt;Virta M, Vedenpää A, Grönroos N, Chydenius E, Partinen M, Vataja R, Kaski M, Iivanainen M (2008). Adults with ADHD benefit from cognitive-behaviorally oriented group rehabilitation: a study of 29 participants. Journal of Attention Disorders, 12(3), 218–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment for patients with acquired brain injury ====
The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of dysexecutive syndrome. The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity, which appears to aid in preventing "goal neglect" by increasing the patients' ability to monitor time and focus on goals. Given such stimuli, subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ.&lt;ref name="Manly 2001"&gt;Manly T, Hawkins K, Evans J, Woldt K, Robertson IH (2002). Rehabilitation of executive function: facilitation of effective goal management on complex tasks using periodic auditory alerts" ''Neuropsychologia'' 40(3):271–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with acquired brain injury have also been exposed to goal management training (GMT). GMT skills are associated with paper-and-pencil tasks that are suitable for patients having difficulty setting goals. From these studies there has been support for the effectiveness of GMT and the treatment of executive dysfunction due to ABI.&lt;ref name="Levine 2000"&gt;Levine B, Robertson IH, Clare L, Carter G &amp; Hong J (2000). Rehabilitation of executive functioning: An experimental–clinical validation of Goal Management Training. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 6: 299–312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental context ===
An understanding of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their role in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"&gt;De Boechorstraat V, Geurts H, Oosterlaan J et al (2001). How specific is a deficit of executive functioning for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"/&gt;

Some research has suggested a link between a child's abilities to gain information about the world around them and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"&gt;Barchfeld P, Kain W, Perner J (2002). Executive control and higher-order theory of mind in children at risk at ADHD. Austria: Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt; One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt; The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of [[theory of mind]] in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt;

However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity.&lt;ref name ="Dennis"&gt;Dennis T (2006).

Maternal communication style with mentally retarded children. American Journal of Mental Retardation, 93; 352–59&lt;/ref&gt; Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child's level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance).&lt;ref name ="Dennis"/&gt; A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.&lt;ref name ="Herman"&gt;Herman B, Mahoney G, Perales F et al (2006). Responsive teaching: early intervention for children with down syndrome and other disabilities.

There is no doubt that there is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The prefrontal lobe controls two related executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem solving, and understanding information, as well as engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"&gt;Ardila A (2008). On the evolutionary origins of executive functions. Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt; The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt;

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"&gt;Barkley RA (2001). The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective. Neuropsychology Review, 11(1), 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which gave rise to the need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

In a similar vein, some have argued that the unique metacognitive capabilities demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, over the course of the development of self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

== Socio-cultural implications ==

=== Education ===
In the classroom environment, children with executive dysfunction typically demonstrate skill deficits that can be categorized into two broad domains: a) self-regulatory skills; and b) goal-oriented skills.&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall A (2001). Executive functions: Practical strategies for supporting students. Psychological Services, DDSB. Symposium conducted at DDSB, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below is an adaptation of McDougall's&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; summary and provides an overview of specific executive function deficits that are commonly observed in a classroom environment. It also offers examples of how these deficits are likely to manifest in behaviour.

Teachers play a crucial role in the implementation of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"&gt;Lerner JW &amp; Kline F (2006). Learning disabilities and related disorders: Characteristics and teaching strategies (10th ed.). United States of America: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.

Several factors should be considered in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"/&gt; It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout the course of the day can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.

People with executive dysfunction have a slower cognitive processing speed and thus often take longer to complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt;

Moreover, some people with ADHD report experiencing frequent feelings of drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown TE (2008). Describing Six Aspects of a Complex Syndrome. http://www.drthomasebrown.com/pdfs/Executive_Functions_by_Thomas_Brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can hinder their attention for lectures, readings, and completing assignments. Individuals with this disorder have also been found to require more stimuli for information processing in reading and writing.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Slow processing may manifest in behavior as signaling a lack of motivation on behalf of the learner. However, slow processing is reflective of an impairment of the ability to coordinate and integrate multiple skills and information sources.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main concern with individuals with autism regarding learning is in the imitation of skills.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism tend to be dependent on the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Being attentive and focused for people with Tourette's syndrome is a difficult process. People affected by this disorder tend to be easily distracted and act very impulsively.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt; That is why it is very important to have a quiet setting with few distractions for the ultimate learning environment. Focusing is particularly difficult for those who are affected by Tourette's syndrome comorbid with other disorders such as ADHD or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], it makes focusing very difficult.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Gaffney GR (2005). Tourette Syndrome. University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329091227/http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these individuals can be found to repeat words or phrases consistently either immediately after they are learned or after a delayed period of time.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt;

=== Criminal behaviour ===

Prefrontal dysfunction has been found as a marker for persistent, criminal behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"&gt;Barbosa M, Monteiro L (2008). Recurrent criminal behaviour and executive dysfunction. The Spanish Journal of Psychology, 259–65&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex is involved with mental functions including; affective range of emotions, forethought, and self-control.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Moreover, there is a scarcity of mental control displayed by individuals with a dysfunction in this area over their behavior, reduced flexibility and self-control and their difficulty to conceive behavioral consequences, which may conclude in unstable (or criminal) behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogilvie|first=James M.|last2=Stewart|first2=Anna L.|last3=Chan|first3=Raymond C.

Statistically significant relations have been discerned between anti-social behavior and executive function deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"/&gt; These findings relate to the emotional instability that is connected with executive function as a detrimental symptom that can also be linked towards criminal behavior. Conversely, it is unclear as to the specificity of anti-social behavior to executive function deficits as opposed to other generalized neuropsychological deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"&gt;Lilenfeld S, Morgan A (2000). A meta-analytic review of the relation between antisocial behavior and neuropsychological measures of executive function.

Furthermore, some think the dysfunction cannot be entirely to blame.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; There are interacting environmental factors that also have an influence on the likelihood of criminal action. This theory proposes that individuals with this deficit are less able to control impulses or foresee the consequences of actions that seem attractive at the time (see above) and are also typically provoked by environmental factors. One must recognize that the frustrations of life, combined with a limited ability to control life events, can easily cause aggression and/or other criminal activities. Early brain Damage causes dopamine(epigentically) to select for "Seeking" behavior in the very short term...this is the window for existence for these individuals...the future has no meaning so consequences have no meaning

[[Image:Specification and Levels of Development.jpg|thumb|360px|Systems engineering model of Specification and Levels of Development. During system development a series of specifications are generated to describe the system at different levels of detail. These program unique specifications form the core of the configuration baselines. As shown here, in addition to referring to different levels within the system hierarchy, these baselines are defined at different phases of the design process.Note: There is one minor (and ironic) typo in the image above.  SI&amp;T is "System Integration and Test" not "System Integration and Text". ]]

{{software development process}}
A '''functional specification''' (also, ''functional spec'', ''specs'', ''functional specifications document (FSD)'', ''functional requirements specification'') in [[systems engineering]] and [[software development]] is a document that specifies the functions that a system or component must perform (often part of a requirements specification) (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765-2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50518 ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 Systems and software engineering — Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentation typically describes what is needed by the system user as well as requested properties of inputs and outputs (e.g. of the [[software]] system). A functional specification is the more technical response to a matching requirements document, e.g. the [[Product requirements document|Product Requirement Document]] "PRD"{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Thus it picks up the results of the [[requirements analysis]] stage. On more complex systems multiple levels of functional specifications will typically nest to each other, e.g. on the system level, on the module level and on the level of technical details.

== Overview ==
A [[function (engineering)|functional]] specification does not define the inner workings of the proposed system; it does not include the specification of how the system function will be implemented.  Instead, it focuses on what various outside agents (people using the program, computer peripherals, or other computers, for example) might "observe" when interacting with the system.

A functional requirement in a functional specification might state as follows:

:''When the user clicks the OK button, the dialog is closed and the focus is returned to the main window in the state it was in before this dialog was displayed.''

Such a requirement describes an interaction between an external agent (the [[User (computing)|user]]) and the software system.  When the user provides input to the system by clicking the OK button, the program responds (or should respond) by closing the dialog window containing the OK button.

== Functional specification topics ==

=== Purpose ===
There are many purposes for functional specifications. One of the primary purposes on team projects is to achieve some form of team consensus on what the program is to achieve before making the more time-consuming effort of writing [[source code]] and [[test case]]s, followed by a period of [[debugging]].  Typically, such consensus is reached after one or more reviews by the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s on the project at hand after having negotiated a cost-effective way to achieve the requirements the software needs to fulfill.

# To let the [[Software developer|developers]] know what to build. 
# To let the [[testers]] know what tests to run.
# To let [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s know what they are getting.

=== Process ===
In the ordered industrial software engineering life-cycle ([[waterfall model]]), functional specification describes ''what'' has to be implemented. The next, [[Systems architecture]] document describes ''how'' the functions will be realized using a chosen software environment. In non industrial, prototypical systems development, functional specifications are typically written after or as part of [[requirements analysis]].

When the team agrees that functional specification consensus is reached, the functional spec is typically declared "complete" or "signed off".  After this, typically the software development and testing team write source code and test cases using the functional specification as the reference.  While testing is performed, the behavior of the program is compared against the expected behavior as defined in the functional specification.

=== Methods ===
One popular method of writing a functional specification document involves drawing or rendering either simple wire frames or accurate, graphically designed UI screenshots. After this has been completed, and the screen examples are approved by all stakeholders, graphical elements can be numbered and written instructions can be added for each number on the screen example. For example, a login screen can have the username field labeled '1' and password field labeled '2,' and then each number can be declared in writing, for use by software engineers and later for beta testing purposes to ensure that functionality is as intended. The benefit of this method is that countless additional details can be attached to the screen examples.

The study of '''geometric morphometrics in anthropology''' has made a major impact on the field of [[morphometrics]] by aiding in some of the technological and methodological advancements. Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelditch2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form...&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Gerhard|title=Virtual Anthropology|journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology|date=2015|issue=156|pages=22–42|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22658|pmid=25418603|volume=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Slice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slice|first1=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2007|issue=1|pages=261–81|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120613|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitteroecker|first1=Philipp|last2=Gunz|first2=Philipp|title=Advances in Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|issue=2|pages=235–247|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed “two-point coordinates” or “Bookstein-shape coordinates”.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

In the 1940s, [[D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948)  looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohlf|first1=F. James|last2=Bookstein|first2=Fred L.|title=Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop|date=1990|publisher=Special Publication 2, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and [[David George Kendall]] (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|title=Anthropology Takes Control of Morphometrics|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|date=2004|volume=2|issue=28|pages=121–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous [[Ötzi|Ötzi skeleton]], which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods.&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004 /&gt;

==Traditional morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|left|BirdMorpho]] 
Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=Sheets|first2=David H.|title=A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=2010|volume=16|issue=Quantitative Methods in Paleobiology|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Dean C.|last2=Rohlf|first2=F. James|last3=Slice|first3=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics: Ten Years of Progress Following the 'Revolution'|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2004|volume=71|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/11250000409356545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: [[principal components]], [[factor analysis]], [[canonical analysis|canonical variate]], and [[discriminant function analysis]]. It is also possible to study [[allometry]], which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape.

==Steps in a geometric morphometric study==
There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study:
# '''Design Study''': what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this? 
# '''[[#Data Collection Methods|Collect Data]]''': choose your landmark set and method of collection
# '''[[#Superimposition|Standardize Data]]''': make your landmarks comparable across all specimens (superimposition) 
# '''[[#Statistical Analysis|Analyze Data]]''': choose a statistical approach depending on your original question and how you designed the study 
# '''[[#Some Applications in Physical Anthropology|Interpret Results]]''': take the outcome of your statistical analysis and reflect it back to the context of your original specimens

==Data collection methods==

===Landmarks===
The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===Semilandmarks===
[[File:3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl.png|thumb|upright=0.5|3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl]]
Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis.

===Deformation grid===
This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Bookstein proposed the use of a [[thin-plate spline]] (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Superimposition==

===[[Generalized Procrustes analysis]] (GPA)===
Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

==Statistical analysis==

===[[Principal components analysis]] (PCA)===
In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample’s covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

===[[Partial least squares regression|Partial least squares]] (PLS)===
Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate regression]]===
Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for [[allometric]] studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Some applications in anthropology==

===Human evolution===

====The human brain====
The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the [[visual cortex]], [[temporal lobe]], and [[parietal cortex]], and increased [[gyrification]] (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual [[endocasts]] (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and [[Neanderthals]] whose brains were similar in size.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Harvati|first2=Katerina|title=Geometric Morphometrics and Virtual Anthropology: Advances in human evolutionary studies|journal=Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology|date=2014|volume=71|pages=41–55|doi=10.1127/0003-5548/2014/0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of [[chimpanzees]] and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early “[[globularization]] phase” in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neubauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubauer|first1=S.|last2=Gunz|first2=P.|last3=Hublin|first3=J.|title=Endocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: A morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=555–566|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.011|pmid=20727571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the “globularization phase” does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Golovanova|first3=L.|last4=Doronichev|first4=V.|last5=Maureille|first5=B.|last6=Hublin|first6=J.|title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development: Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neanderthal newborn from Mezmaiskaya|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|issue=2|pages=300–313|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013|pmid=22221766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Maureille|first3=B.|last4=Hublin|first4=J.|title=Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=21|pages=921–922|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.018|pmid=21056830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pleistocene cranial morphology====
There have been many debates on the relationships between [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] hominin crania from [[Eurasia]] and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate. They found that some features were more Neanderthal like while others were primitive and likely from the Middle Pleistocene African hominins, so the argument could still go either way.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvati2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvati|first1=K.|last2=Hublin|first2=J.|last3=Gunz|first3=P.|title=Evolution of middle-late Pleistocene human cranio-facial form: a 3D approach|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=445–464|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.005|pmid=20708775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freidline and colleagues further added to the debate by looking at both adult and subadult crania of modern and Pleistocene hominins using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidline&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freidline|first1=SE|last2=Gunz|first2=G.|last3=Harvati|first3=K.|last4=Hublin|first4=J|title=Middle Pleistocene human facial morphology in an evolutionary and developmental context|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=63|issue=5|pages=723–740|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.08.002|pmid=22981042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern human variation===

====Ancestry and sex estimation of crania====
Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in [[forensic]] contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called [http://www.3d-id.org/ 3D-ID], can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used.&lt;ref name=RossSlice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ann H.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Williams|first3=Shanna E.|title=Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls|date=2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls]

====Sex estimation of os coxae====
Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as ''[[os coxae]]''. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the [[obturator foramen]]. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a [[Fourier Analysis|Discriminant Fourier Analysis]].&lt;ref name=Bierryetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierry|first1=Guillaume|last2=Le Minor|first2=Jean-Marie|last3=Schmittbuhl|first3=Mathieu|title=Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropológico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a [[K-means clustering|K-means Cluster Analysis]] to determine a sex category before performing a [[Discriminant function analysis|Discriminant Function analysis]]. The results had a classification accuracy for the [[greater sciatic notch]] of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1%&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Paula N.|last2=Bernal|first2=Valeria|last3=Perez|first3=Ivan S.|title=Geometric Morphometric Approach to Sex Estimation of Human Pelvis|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.012|volume=189|issue=1–3|pages=68–74|pmid=19442464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''global village''' represents the [[approximation|simplifying]] of the whole world into one village through the use of [[electronic media]]. ''Global village'' is also a term to express the constituting relationship between [[socioeconomics|economics and other social sciences]] throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian [[media theorist]], [[Marshall McLuhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "Global Village" as it is. According to M. McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a Joyce scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term.

The new reality of the [[digital age]] has implications for forming new socially meaningful structures within the context of [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential McLuhan|last=Mcluhan|first=Eric|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-465-01995-1|location=Concord, Ont. : Anansi|pages=7–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging messages, stories, opinions, posts, and videos through channels on telecommunication pathways can cause miscommunication-- especially through different cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720608000153|title=Cultural diversity and information and communication technology impacts on global virtual teams|last=Shachaf|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.12.003|volume=45|journal=Information &amp; Management|pages=131–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary analysts question the causes of changes in community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often they speculate about whether or not the consequences of these changes could lead to some new sociological structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of them have pointed out that the increased velocity of transactions has fostered international density, making [[social network]]s a catalyst for [[social change]].

Across the global village people have reached out and transcended their neighborhoods. They are involved in a complex community of networks stretching across cities, nations, oceans, and governments. Yet at the same time the increasing communications with friends on [[social media]] may also increase the density of interconnections within already existing social clusters. The global village's implications on sociological structures are yet to be fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Network Community: An Introduction to Networks and Global Village'', By: Barry Wellman&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does multimedia have the ability to impact individuals differently for cultural reasons, but messages also affect people due to their religion, politics, beliefs, business, money etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The time in which messages are received also affects how a message is understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Marshall McLuhan’s time, the global village was already apparent. It was already a comprehensive and seminal way to grasp what was happening to the world at large at any time (and correspondingly, what should be done with this in mind): "The global village absolutely ensures maximal disagreement on all points" (McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool. New York: The New American Library, p.&amp;nbsp;272).

During the primitive years, people primarily stayed in tune with the simultaneous mode of their perception and thinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today human society struggles neurologically, with the simultaneous mode taking the upper hand once again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Our brains are constantly adapting and morphing to the modifications of [[technological advancement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through technology, the creation of social media allows people to constantly comment on each other's posts as well as creating them to share with the multi-media global world. 55% of teens possess a social media account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/|title=Center for Media Literacy|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has connected people with jobs that they couldn’t have received before because of their geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediacritiques.net|title=Journal of Media Critiques [JMC]|website=www.mediacritiques.net|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social medias have connected the world so that users can learn more about cultures different from their own through interactions on social media as well as maintaining relationships from opposing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebecca|first=Sawyer,|date=2011-01-01|title=The Impact of New Social Media on Intercultural Adaptation|url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/242/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global village and media ==
People use technology to fit into a [[digital community]] to which they aren't physically connected, but mentally connected. Each [[social media platform]] acts as a digital home for individuals, allowing people to express themselves through the global village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A Review of General Semantics argues that media ecology and new media have expanded who has the ability to create and view media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valcanis|first=Tom|date=|year=2011|title=An iPhone in Every Hand: Media Ecology, Communication Structures, and the Global Village|url=|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=68|pages=33–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mass media began, it has called for the westernization of the world, hence the global village.  Without the mass media in effect countries like India or Turkey wouldn’t be living [[American way|American lifestyle]] because they wouldn’t have the knowledge of what the acquisitions of the American nation constitute. Since most of the developing countries acquired the news and entertainment from developed nations like the U.S, the information received is biased in favor of developed nations which connects the world in similarities within the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M|first=Kraidy, Marwan|date=2002-01-01|title=Globalization of Culture Through the Media|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/325/|journal=Encyclopedia of Communication and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time communicative activities of people. Social Spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others who share the same interests and concerns. According to McLuhan, the enhanced "electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree." &lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia"&gt;''Understanding Media'', McGraw Hill, 1964, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Increased speed of communication and the ability for people to read about, spread, and react to global news quickly, forces us to become more involved with others from various social groups and countries around the world and to be more aware of our global responsibilities.&lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia" /&gt; Similarly, web-connected computers enable people to link their web sites together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Global theater==
No chapter in ''Understanding Media'', later books, contains the idea that the global village and the electronic media create unified communities. In an interview with Gerald Stearn,&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, Gerald Emmanuel. ''McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool'' (1968), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan says that it never occurred to him that uniformity and tranquility were the properties of the global village. McLuhan argued that the global village ensures maximal disagreement on all points because it creates more discontinuity and division and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] under the increase of the village conditions. The global village is far more diverse.
 
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan starts using the term ''global theater'' to emphasize the changeover from consumer to producer, from acquisition to involvement, from job holding to role playing, stressing that there is no more community to clothe the naked specialist.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall and Nevitt, Barrington. ''From Take Today: The Executive as Dropout'' (Harcourt Brace, 1972) p 265 and back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:
* the "art of government"&lt;ref name="burchell1"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmentality', trans.

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to health care ===

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

'''Gross National Wellness or Well-being''' ('''GNW''') is a socioeconomic development and measurement framework. The GNW / GNH Index consists of 7 dimensions: economic, environmental, physical, mental, work, social, and political. Most wellness areas include both subjective results (via survey) and objective data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/grossnationalhappiness/ "Global GNW / GNH Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192803/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf "National Indicators for a New Era (page 81), Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[https://dugi-doc.udg.edu/bitstream/handle/10256/15117/ortuzar-fernandez.pdf?sequence=1 "Empirical Study of Healthcare and Life Satisfaction in Spain at University De Girona"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
The GNW Index is also known as the first GNH Index or [[Gross National Happiness]] Index, not to be confused with Bhutan's GNH Index. Both econometric frameworks are different in authorship, creation dates, and geographic scope. The GNW / GNH index is a global development measurement framework published in 2005 by the International Institute of Management in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;H A Hellyer, [http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter "UAE National Newspaper on Happiness Ministry Background"].&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=20R9_6rC-LoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=GNH "Ecological Economics Book - page 274"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gross National Happiness]] phrase was coined in 1972 by [[Sicco Mansholt]], one of the founders of the [[European Union]] and the fourth President of the [[European Commission]], and was later popularized by [[Bhutan]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-gnh-origin.htm "The Origin of Gross National Happiness - The European GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no GNH Index existed until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness "The History of Gross National Happiness, Professor Monica Correa, Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNH philosophy suggested that the ideal purpose of governments is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness and the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/papers/mcdonald.pdf "McDonald, Ross (2005). "Rethinking Development. Local Pathways to Global Wellbeing". St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. p. 3."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of economic policies on the subjective well-being of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/bitstream/10071/13633/1/HappinessSeekingThesis_AnaRodrigues.pdf  Selling Happiness - Lisbon University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index paper proposed the first GNH Index as a solution to help with the implementation of the GHN philosophy and was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political mission statement into a second generation implementation holistic (objective and subjective) concept and by treating happiness as a socioeconomic development metric that word provide an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrates subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-research-library/happiness-economics-history-milestones-timeline.htm "Happiness Economics Timeline and Milestones - GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316091499_A_Modern_History_of_Happiness_as_Economic_Policy "A Modern History of Happiness as Economic Policy Dr Deidre Rose, University of Guelph"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index is a secular econometric model that tracks 7 subjective and objective development areas with no religious measurement components. On the other hand, Bhutan's GNH Index is a local development framework and measurement index, published by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH Research|Centre for Bhutan Studies]] in 2012 based on 2011 Index function designed by Alkire-Foster at [[Oxford University]]. The Bhutan's GNH Index is customized to the country's Buddhist cultural and spiritual values, it tracks 9 subjective happiness areas including spiritual measurement such as prayers recitation and other Karma indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|author1=Karma Ura|author2=Sabina Alkire|author3=Tshoki Zangmo|author4=Karma Wangdi|title=A Short Summary of Bhutan GNH Index|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|year=2012|isbn=978-99936-14-66-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and issues at the heart of Bhutanese approach are similar to the secular GNH Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSy7Ubd-PX8C&amp;pg=PA31|author=Alastair Campbell|title=The Happy Depressive: In Pursuit of Personal and Political Happiness|publisher=Arrow Books|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a policy white paper providing recommendations for implementing the GNW Index metric was published by the International Institute of Management. The paper is widely referenced by academic and policy maker citing the GNW / GNH index as a potential model for local socioeconomic development and measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medjones.com/happiness-economics-gross-national-wellbeing-happiness-index.htm "Happiness Economics - GNH Index Research Citations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==GNW survey components==
The subjective survey part of the GNW measurement system is structured into seven areas or dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/polls/GrossNationalHappinessSurvey.htm "The Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey - Global GNH Index Survey"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Each area or dimension satisfaction rating is scaled from 0–10: 0 being very dissatisfied, 5 being neutral, and 10 is very satisfied.

#Mental &amp; Emotional Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Frequency and levels of positive vs. negative thoughts and feelings over the past year
#Physical &amp; Health Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Physical safety and health, including risk to life, body and property and the cost and quality of healthcare, if one gets sick
#Work &amp; Income Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Job and income to support essential living expenses, including shelter, food, transportation, and education. If a head of household, the expenses to support household/family is included
#Social Relations Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Relations with the significant other, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and community
#Economic &amp; Retirement Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Disposable (extra) income, which is the remaining money after paying for essential living expenses. This money can be used for leisure activities, retirement savings, investments, or charity.
#Political &amp; Government Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Political rights, privacy and personal freedom as well the performance of the government (including socioeconomic development policies effectiveness and efficiency) 
#Living Environment Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;City/urban planning, utilities, infrastructure, traffic, architecture, landscaping and nature's pollution (including noise, air, water, and soil)

The survey also asks four qualitative questions to identify key causes of happiness and unhappiness:

#What are the top positive things in your life that make you happy?
#What are the top challenges and causes of stress in your life?
#What would you advise your government to increase your well-being and happiness?
#What are the most influential city, state, federal or international projects? How are they impacting your well-being and happiness (positively or negatively)?

==Criticism==
One major criticism is that the use of subjective surveys can lead to unreliable conclusions{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}.

'''HASTAC''' (Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory, pronounced "haystack") is a virtual organization of more than 14,000 individuals and institutions dedicated to innovative new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning.  HASTAC network members contribute to the community by sharing work and ideas with others via the open-access website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org |title=hastac.org |publisher=hastac.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; by hosting HASTAC conferences and workshops online or in their region, by initiating conversations, or by working collaboratively with others in the HASTAC network.

HASTAC administers the annual $2 million MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MacArthur Foundation |url=http://www.macfound.org/programs/learning/ |title=MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning Competition |publisher=MacArthur Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Competition, “Badges for Lifelong Learning,” launched in collaboration with the [[Mozilla Foundation]], focused on digital badges as a means to inspire learning, confirm accomplishment, or validate the acquisition of knowledge or skills.

Since its inception, HASTAC has been funded by [[Digital Promise]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], and [[Duke University]].

== Founding ==
HASTAC was founded in 2002 by [[Cathy N. Davidson]], Ruth F. DeVarney Professor of English, John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies and Co-director of the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge at Duke University and co-founder of the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cathy Davidson |url=http://www.cathydavidson.com/about/ |title=Cathy N. Davidson, Author of Now You See It |publisher=Cathy Davidson|date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Theo Goldberg]], Director of the [[University of California]]'s statewide Humanities Research Institute ([[UCHRI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UCHRI |url=http://uchri.org/about/staff/dr-david-theo-goldberg/ |title=David Theo Goldberg, UCHRI |publisher=UCHRI |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of humanities leaders held by the [[Mellon Foundation]] in 2002, it was clear that Davidson and Goldberg had each, independently, been working on a variety of projects with leading scientists and engineers dedicated to expanding the innovative uses of technology in research, teaching, and electronic publishing.  They resolved to contact others who were building and analyzing the social and ethical dimensions of new technologies and soon formed the HASTAC consortium with a dozen or so other noted educators, scientists, and technology designers.

==Membership==

According to its website, “HASTAC members are motivated by the conviction that the digital era provides rich opportunities for informal and formal learning and for collaborative, networked research that extends across traditional disciplines, across the boundaries of the academy and the community, across the "two cultures" of humanism and technology, across the divide of thinking versus making, and across social strata and national borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Login Contact |url=http://www.hastac.org/about-hastac |title=About |publisher=HASTAC |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HASTAC's members include professors, students, public intellectuals, artists, educators, software or hardware designers, scientists, gamers, programmers, librarians, and social and political organizers. Specializations include the full range of the humanities and social sciences, the arts, journalism, digital humanities, computational fields, sciences, information science, and engineering, plus those interested in intellectual property issues  and public policy on a local or global scale.

==Programs==

=== HASTAC Scholars program ===
In 2008, HASTAC initiated the HASTAC Scholars Program, an annual fellowship program that recognizes graduate and undergraduate students who are engaged in innovative work across the areas of technology, the arts, the humanities, and the social sciences. As of 2012, 522 people at 120 institutions have been named HASTAC Scholars, functioning as links between their home institutions and the virtual community they foster on the HASTAC site. "HASTAC scholars participate in and encourage conversations often by blogging, tweeting, podcasting, or co-hosting forums with HASTAC scholars
from other universities, among other various means of connection".&lt;ref&gt;Singletary, Kim Alecia. "Interdisciplinary intellect HASTAC and the commitment to encourage collective intelligence". Arts and Humanities in Higher Education (2012), vol 11: pp. 109-119. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HASTAC/MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning Competition ===
Created in 2007, the HASTAC/MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning Competition  is designed to find and inspire the most innovative uses of new media in support of [[Connected Learning|connected learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital Media and Learning Research Hub |url=http://connectedlearning.tv |title=Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awards have recognized individuals, for-profit companies, universities, and community organizations using new media to transform learning. Information about Digital Media and Learning Competition winners can be found on HASTAC.

The Digital Media and Learning Competition is funded by the MacArthur Foundation and administered by HASTAC. For the fourth competition, other partners included the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Mozilla.

The concept of '''hisba''' (حِسْبة [ḥisba], calculation; verification) is an [[Islam]]ic practice not explicitly in the [[Qur'an]] or in the corpus of [[sahih]] [[hadith]]. In a book review, Mohammad Umar Memon explains that "the institution of the hisba has been generally understood as one seeking to ensure correct economic and commercial practices among the Muslim ''[[ummah|umma]]''". &lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Umar Memon. Review of ''Public Duties in Islam: The Institution of the Hisba''. by [[Ibn Taymiya]]; [[Muhtar Holland]] (trans.) International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 17, No. 1. (Feb., 1985), pp. 141-142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163324 Stable URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In the beginning, under [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], it was a civic institution intended to supervise the course of economic and commercial affairs as well as the legality of contracts. Its foundation is based on a verse which makes a list of major interdicts.

: "And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember." (6:152, trans. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]])

The '''Kinetic PreProcessor''' (KPP) is an [[open-source software]] tool used in [[atmospheric chemistry]]. Taking a set of chemical reactions and their rate coefficients as input, KPP generates [[Fortran#Fortran 90|Fortran 90]], [[Fortran#FORTRAN 77|FORTRAN 77]], [[C (programming language)|C]], or [[Matlab]] code 
of the resulting [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|ordinary differential equations (ODEs)]]. Solving the ODEs allows the temporal integration of the kinetic system. Efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity structures of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]]. A comprehensive suite of stiff numerical integrators is also provided. Moreover, KPP can be used to generate the tangent linear model, as well as the continuous and discrete adjoint models of the chemical system.

The '''language laboratory''' is an audio or audio-visual installation used as an aid in [[modern language]] teaching. They can be found, amongst other places, in [[schools]], [[universities]], and academies. Perhaps the first lab was at the University of Grenoble in 1908.&lt;ref name="prl"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Léon, P.R.|year=1962|title=Laboratoire de langues et correction phonétique.|publisher=Paris: Didier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wbr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roby, W.B.|year=2004|title=Technology in the service of foreign language teaching: The case of the language laboratory. In D. Jonassen (ed.), Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology, 523-541, 2nd ed.|accessdate=2010-01-30|url=http://www.aect.org/edtech/19.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s up until the 1990s, they were [[Compact Cassette|tape]]-based systems using [[reel to reel]] or (latterly) [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]. Current installations are generally multimedia [[Personal computer|PCs]]. The original language labs are now very outdated. They allowed a teacher to listen to and manage student audio via a hard-wired analogue tape deck based systems with 'sound booths' in fixed locations.

==Appearance and configuration==
The 'traditional' system generally comprises a master console (teacher position) which is electrically connected to a number of rows of student booths (US: carrels), typically containing a student tape recorder and [[Headset (audio)|headset]] with a boom arm [[microphone]].

The teacher console is usually fitted with master playback source equipment (tape recorder), some means of monitoring of each booth in the class via the teacher headset and an intercom 
facility offering 2-way communication between teacher and student.

All but the most simple or first generation laboratories allow the teacher to remotely control 
the tape transport controls of the student booths (record, stop, rewind etc.) from the master 
desk. This allows for easy distribution of the master programme material, which is often copied at high speed onto the student positions for later use by the students at their own pace.

Better tape laboratories housed the tape machine behind a protective plate (leaving only a 
control panel accessible to the students) or locked the cassette door. This kept the expensive 
and sensitive decks free from student misuse and dust etc.

==Operation==
Once the master program had been transferred onto the student recorders, the teacher would then hand over control of the decks to the students. By pressing the record key in the booth, the student would simultaneously hear the playback of the program whilst being able to record his or her voice in the pauses, using the microphone. This is known as an audio active-comparative system. From a technological point of view, this [[overdubbing]] was made possible by use of a two-channel tape recorder

==Problems==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0422-0004, Langenstein, Russischunterricht für Lehrlinge.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white picture of two students wearing headphones. One student's booth is numbered "17", and the other's is numbered "18".|Russian language class in an East German language laboratory (1975)]]

Language laboratories in the 1970s and 1980s received a bad reputation due to breakdowns. Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the [[reel to reel]] tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems in place for the teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to stop the tape running off the reel in fast rewind or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse.

The [[tape recorders]] in use after the early 1970s in the language laboratory were more complex than those in the home, being capable of multitracking and electronic remote control. As a result, they often had several motors and [[relays]], complex [[transistor]]ised circuitry and needed a variety of voltages to run. They had lots of [[rubber]] parts such as idlers and drive belts which would perish and wear out. [[Bulbs]] in the control panels were also in continual need of replacement. Since the student booth tapes were not normally changed from one class to the next but were recorded over each time, these would eventually wear, and shed their oxide on the tape heads leading to poor sound and tangling.

The installations were usually maintained under contract by service engineers, but these often served a county or similar wide area, and would only call at 3-monthly intervals. This meant that if several booths malfunctioned, then for much of that time the laboratory was out of action.

==Change of media==
[[File:Japanese High school Language Lab3.JPG|thumb|alt=A large desk curved round in a semicircle housing five computer monitors and audio equipment.|A modern language laboratory control center]]

The demise of the traditional language laboratory came in the 1980s, with the falling out of favour of the [[audio-lingual method]] commonly in place in 1960s teaching methodology, and the expensive repairs needed to the open reel tape machines due to student misuse, neglect, or wear and tear. Many schools transformed their old language labs into computer suites.  However, the advent of affordable [[multimedia]] capable [[Personal computer|PCs]] in the late 1990s led to a resurgence and transformation of the language laboratory with software and [[hard drives]] in place of reels of analogue [[Magnetic tape|tape]].

In the 1990s new digital, hybrid PC based systems allowed extended functionality, in terms of better "management' of student / teacher audio with some levels of internet and video formats.

Media is 'managed' on these hybrid systems by language lab providers creating a supplementary network over and above the existing PC network for audio connections and communications in fixed locations. These hybrid systems are not without problems, mainly associated with hardware issues  as the manufacturers of these hybrid systems have to replace parts and separate cabling. This both adds to the complexity of the product and has a cost implication via manufacturer annual ‘service’ fees.

==Present day==
[[File:Japanese High school Language Lab4.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A close-up of the space between two student terminals. There are two computers embedded into the desk, and flat-screen monitors sit on top of the desk. The students' headphones are hanging on hooks below the desk.|Student terminals and headphones]]

Today all the major manufacturers say they have a ‘digital’ or a ‘just software’ solution. However, in many cases they still rely on proprietary networks or expensive sound cards to successfully deliver their media. There are very few truly software only solutions that just rely on installing designated language lab software onto a network and then directing just the original network to manage the media between teacher and student, student and student or student back to teacher. In the past the quality of school, or university networks may have meant that the speed that the media could be delivered on ‘software only’ labs would have meant a ‘lag’ in the audio feed. These days all professionally run networks are able to work with these ‘software only’ language lab solutions and deliver media synchronously.

Software only systems can be easily installed onto an existing PC based network, making them both multi locational in their access and much more feature rich in how and what media they manage.

The content that is now used in the new language labs is much richer and self authored or free: now not just audio, but video, flash based games, internet etc. and the speed and variety of the delivery of media from teacher to student, student to teacher, is much quicker and therefore much more engaging for both teacher and student.

Further developments in language labs are now apparent as access moves from a fixed network and related Microsoft operating systems to online and browsers. Students can now access and work from these new 'cloud' labs from their own devices at any time and anywhere. Students can interrogate and record audio and video files and be marked and assessed by their teachers remotely.

==Digital language labs==
The principle of a language lab essentially has not changed. They are still a teacher-controlled system connected to a number of student booths, containing a student's control mechanism and a headset with a microphone. Digital language labs have the same principle. A software-only language lab changes the concept of where and what a language lab is. Software can be installed and accessed on any networked PC anywhere on a school, college, or university campus. Software-only systems can be located in one room, from room-to-room or campus-to-campus.

==Functionality==
The levels of functionality of current language labs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. All labs will have a level of teacher control to manage student licenses / desktops. The more sophisticated ‘software only’ labs have a higher level of teacher management and control over the student desktop. One of the key differences with the ‘high end’ ‘software only’ products is their ability to work ‘live’ with the students as they record and work with media. So instead of waiting to correct student recordings after they have been recorded and collected back it is now possible for a teacher to work synchronously and ‘live’ with students on their own, in pairs and in groups, thus enhancing the immediacy of the teaching and learning experience.

The next generation digital language labs allow teachers to monitor, control, deliver, group, display, review and collect, audio, video and web based multimedia content. The student player is linked to the teacher console and can play audio, video and web based formats. Students can rewind, stop, start, go back to last silence, record, fast forward, repeat phrase and bookmark.

== Advantages ==
There are different features of language lab, which make the students to have interactive session.  It provides equal opportunity to all the students to hear the instructor irrespective of place where they are seated. There will be less miscommunication because of direct nature of the sound transmission. It also provides the privacy that encourages the shy students to speak without any hesitation. In addition instructor can speak to individual or group of students in privacy without interrupting rest of class. Language labs motivate students to talk freely and lose the shyness when talking in front of their friends. Attention on subject is increased resulting in better retention of the concepts. Furthermore, it develops the listening and communication skills, since they hear correct pronunciation through their headphones. Learner will show more enthusiasm and excitement in learning lesson because of learning lab system.
Teacher can look after each student, which is not possible in case of the regular classroom. In a lab instructor can communicate with many students by pressing a mouse key in order to talk with students. Efficient use of time and learning efficiency is much more than usual classroom learning. This set up fosters more interactive session between students and teacher. The language lab brings variety in teaching learning process instead of boring verbal centered teaching. The student’s progress can also be monitored regularly so that teacher can provide feedback based on individual pace and ability. Finally, the students can learn the lesson at their own pace thus allowing the classroom as student-centered approach.&lt;ref&gt;•	http://download.ascdirect-usa.com/lab%20benefits/benefits%20and%20advantages.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
It is very expensive to set up the language lab in country like India.Because There is no lab syllabus and usually language classes are conducted as theory. Moreover, the lab can engage maximum of 60 students hence space is also difficult for school.  These days student does not have enough patience to listen to pronunciation and practice them so the recording of pronunciation is useless. As the teacher listens to students randomly the response can be unorganized and ineffective as there are many students to attend to.  The teacher should be well trained in executing the language lab effectively. Given the nature of teaching, a language teacher may need an assistant in taking care of the technological part while teacher attends to the instructional components. As technology changes rapidly, there should be a provision for an upgrade in the medium of instructions, which can be burden for school in terms of finances. The ministry of education should consider allocating funds to set up as well as maintenance of language lab. If all these basic problems can be solved only then we can think of implementing language lab in our curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=singh|first1=S|title=Language Laboratory: Purposes and Shortcomings|journal=journal of Technology for ELT|date=2013|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of language ==
In the current digital age, we are all connected regardless of the geographic distance. Advancement in technology has metaphorically brought the world into our living room in the form of TV or internet which allow us to watch events happening in other countries or talk to friends and family living in another continents via internet. As a result, we are exposed to different languages, cultures and traditions of people from all over the world. As we live in multilingual and multicultural world, language lab can greatly help students to learn language of their choice, as it will allow students to learn at their own pace. They can record and assess their performance to make sure that they are paying attention to all aspects of phonetics such as pronunciation, accents and stress etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hmoud|first1=SNA Al|title=The Effectiveness of using English Lab on English Language Students` Pronunciation|journal=Journal of Scientific Research|date=2014|volume=1|pages=84–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language lab provides access to native-speakers via audio-video aids so that they learn correctly. Given large number of students pursue higher studies outside their home country; language lab would help them in studying the language of the country where they are planning to pursue their higher education. For example, non-native English speaking students are required to give TOEFL/IELTS if they plan to study in North America. While there are several benefits to language resource center, there should be proper safeguard in place to regulate and monitor the use of technologies employed in the teaching learning process so that students do not misuse them. It is also important that the lay out of the lab is conducive for effective communication and monitoring of the students. As strong communication skills are essential in almost all of the professional careers, language lab can help in acquiring this important skill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">A '''loose sentence''' (also called a cumulative sentence) is a type of sentence in which the main idea ([[Clause#Independent and dependent clauses|independent clause]]) is elaborated by the successive addition of modifying clauses or phrases.

==Construction==

It adds modifying elements after the subject, complement, and verb.

==Effect==

Loose sentences may make a work seem informal, relaxed, and conversational.  However, according to Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (2000), a succession of loose sentences, especially those of two clauses, is to be avoided because of "mechanical symmetry and sing-song".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "Bells rang, filling the air with their clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry, bringing people into the streets to hear the news." (From the English Reviewer)
* She drove her car to go to the movies, and got gas.
* "I have been assured by a very knowing American friend of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nourished is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked or boiled; and I make no doubt it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout." Jonathan Swift, [[A Modest Proposal]]

== Alternatives ==
If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strunk Jr.|first1=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=July 28, 2009|publisher=W L C|isbn=1557427283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the writer wanted to rewrite the above examples he could write:
* Bells rang. Their resonance filled the air with clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry. Upon hearing the sounds, the townspeople rushed into the streets. They all stood in silence and awaited the news. 
* She drove to the movies. Afterwards she went to the gas station to fill up.

'''Molecular graphics''' ('''MG''') is the discipline and philosophy of studying [[molecule]]s and their properties through graphical representation.&lt;ref name="Dickerson1969"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickerson | first = R.E. |author2=Geis, I. | title = The structure and action of proteins | publisher = W.A. Benjamin | year = 1969 | location = Menlo Park, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IUPAC]] limits the definition to representations on a "graphical display device".&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=molecular graphics|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/MT06970.html|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s atoms and [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]]'s [[benzene]], there has been a rich history of hand-drawn atoms and molecules, and these representations have had an important influence on modern molecular graphics. This article concentrates on the use of computers to create molecular graphics. Note, however, that many molecular graphics programs and systems have close coupling between the graphics and editing commands or calculations such as in [[molecular modelling]].

==Relation to molecular models==
[[File:jmol1.png|thumb|Fig. 1. Key: [[Hydrogen]] = white, [[carbon]] = grey, [[nitrogen]] = blue, [[oxygen]] = red, and [[phosphorus]] = orange.]]
There has been a long tradition of creating [[molecular model]]s from physical materials. Perhaps the best known is [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|Watson's]] model of DNA built from rods and planar sheets, but the most widely used approach is to represent all atoms and bonds explicitly using the "[[ball-and-stick model|ball and stick]]" approach. This can demonstrate a wide range of properties, such as shape, relative size, and flexibility. Many chemistry courses expect that students will have access to ball and stick models. One goal of mainstream molecular graphics has been to represent the "ball and stick" model as realistically as possible and to couple this with calculations of molecular properties.

''Figure 1'' shows a small molecule ({{chem|NH|3|CH|2|CH|2|C(OH)(PO|3|H)(PO|3|H)-}}), as drawn by the [[Jmol]] program. It is important to realize that the colors and shapes are purely a convention, as individual atoms are not colored, nor do they have hard surfaces. [[Chemical bond|Bond]]s between atoms are also not rod-shaped.

===Comparison of physical models with molecular graphics===
Physical models and computer models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models can be used by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although [[Haptic technology|haptic]] devices have occasionally been built). On a computer screen, the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the [[pseudorotation]] of [[cyclohexane]] is a good example of the value of mechanical models.

However, it is difficult to build large physical molecules, and all-atom physical models of even simple proteins could take weeks or months to build. Moreover, physical models are not robust and they decay over time. Molecular graphics is particularly valuable for representing global and local properties of molecules, such as electrostatic potential. Graphics can also be animated to represent molecular processes and chemical reactions, a feat that is not easy to reproduce physically.

==History==

Initially the rendering was on early [[Cathode ray tube]] screens or through [[plotter]]s drawing on paper. Molecular structures have always been an attractive choice for developing new [[computer graphics]] tools, since the input data are easy to create and the results are usually highly appealing. The first example of MG was a display of a [[protein]] molecule (Project MAC, 1966) by [[Cyrus Levinthal]] and Robert Langridge. Among the milestones in high-performance MG was the work of [[Nelson Max]] in "realistic" rendering of [[macromolecule]]s using reflecting [[sphere]]s.

By about 1980 many laboratories both in academia and industry had recognized the power of the computer to analyse and predict the properties of molecules, especially in [[materials science]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. The discipline was often called "molecular graphics" and in 1982 a group of academics and industrialists in the UK set up the Molecular Graphics Society (MGS). Initially much of the technology concentrated either on high-performance [[3D graphics]], including  interactive rotation or 3D rendering of atoms as spheres (sometimes with [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]]). During the 1980s a number of programs for calculating molecular properties (such as [[molecular dynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]) became available and the term "molecular graphics" often included these. As a result, the MGS has now changed its name to the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society (MGMS).

The requirements of [[X-ray crystallography|macromolecular crystallography]] also drove MG because  the traditional techniques of physical model-building could not scale. The first two protein structures solved by molecular graphics without the aid of the Richards' Box were built with Stan Swanson's program FIT on the Vector General graphics display in the laboratory of Edgar Meyer at Texas A&amp;M University: First Marge Legg in Al Cotton's lab at A&amp;M solved the structure of staph. nuclease (1975) and then Jim Hogle solved the structure of monoclinic lysozyme in 1976. A full year passed before other graphics systems were used to replace the Richards' Box for modelling into density in 3-D. Alwyn Jones' FRODO program (and later "O") were developed to overlay the molecular [[electron density]] determined from X-ray crystallography and the hypothetical molecular structure.

In 2009 [[BALLView]] became the first software to use [[Raytracing]] for molecular graphics.

==Art, science and technology in molecular graphics==
[[File:Hemagglutinin molecule.png|thumb|upright|Fig. 2. Image of [[hemagglutinin]] with alpha [[helices]] depicted as cylinders and the rest of the chain as silver coils. The individual protein molecules (several thousand) have been hidden. All of the non-hydrogen atoms in the two [[ligand]]s (presumably [[sialic acid]]) have been shown near the top of the diagram. Key: [[Carbon]] = grey, [[oxygen]] = red, [[nitrogen]] = blue.]]

Both computer technology and graphic arts have contributed to molecular graphics. The development of [[structural biology]] in the 1950s led to a requirement to display molecules with thousands of [[atom]]s. The existing computer technology was limited in power, and in any case a naive depiction of all atoms left viewers overwhelmed. Most systems therefore used conventions where information was implicit or stylistic. Two [[vector graphics|vectors]] meeting at a point implied an atom or (in macromolecules) a complete [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] (10-20 atoms).

The macromolecular approach was popularized by Dickerson and Geis' presentation of proteins and the graphic work of [[Jane S. Richardson|Jane Richardson]] through high-quality hand-drawn diagrams such as the [[Ribbon diagram|"ribbon"]] representation. In this they strove to capture the intrinsic 'meaning' of the molecule. This search for the "messages in the molecule" has always accompanied the increasing power of computer graphics processing. Typically the depiction would concentrate on specific areas of the molecule (such as the [[active site]]) and this might have different colors or more detail in the number of explicit atoms or the type of depiction (e.g., spheres for atoms).

In some cases the limitations of technology have led to serendipitous methods for rendering. Most early graphics devices used [[vector graphics]], which meant that rendering spheres and surfaces was impossible. Michael Connolly's program "MS" calculated points on the surface-accessible surface of a molecule, and the points were rendered as dots with good visibility using the new vector graphics technology, such as the Evans and Sutherland PS300 series. Thin sections ("slabs") through the structural display showed very clearly the [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] of the surfaces for molecules binding to active sites, and the "Connolly surface" became a universal metaphor.

The relationship between the art and science of molecular graphics is shown in the exhibitions sponsored by the [[Molecular Graphics Society]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some exhibits are created with molecular graphics programs alone, while others are [[collage]]s, or involve physical materials. An example from Mike Hann (1994), inspired by [[Magritte|Magritte's]] painting ''Ceci n'est pas une pipe'', uses an image of a [[salmeterol]] molecule. "''Ceci n'est pas une molecule''," writes Mike Hann, "serves to remind us that all of the graphics images presented here are not molecules, not even pictures of molecules, but pictures of icons which we believe represent some aspects of the molecule's properties."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Colour molecular graphics is often use on chemistry journal covers in an artistic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Electronic Visualisation in Chemistry: From Alchemy to Art | first1=Karl | last1=Harrison | first2=Jonathan P. | last2=Bowen | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | first3=Alice M. | last3=Bowen | editor-first1=Kia | editor-last1=Ng | editor-first2=Jonathan P. | editor-last2=Bowen | editor-first3=Sarah | editor-last3=McDaid | work=EVA London 2013 Conference Proceedings | series=[http://ewic.bcs.org/ Electronic Workshops in Computing] | publisher=[[British Computer Society]] | year=2013 | pages=267–274 | url=http://ewic.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/51042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-filling models===
{{Main|Space-filling model}}
[[File:FormicAcid.pdb.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Space-filling model of formic acid. Key: [[Hydrogen]] = white, [[carbon]] = black, [[oxygen]] = red.]]
Fig. 4 is a "space-filling" representation of [[formic acid]], where atoms are drawn as solid spheres to suggest the space they occupy. This and all space-filling models are necessarily icons or abstractions:  atoms are nuclei with [[Electron cloud#Shapes of orbitals|electron "clouds"]] of varying density surrounding them, and as such have no actual surfaces. For many years the size of atoms has been approximated by physical models ([[CPK coloring|CPK]]) in which the volumes of plastic balls describe where much of the electron density is to be found (often sized to [[van der Waals radius|van der Waals radii]]). That is, the surface of these models is meant to represent a specific ''level of [[Electron density|density]]'' of the electron cloud, not any putative physical surface of the atom.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Isosurface on molecule.jpg|left|thumb|Fig. 5. A molecule (zirconocene) where part (left) is rendered as ball-and-stick and part (right) as an isosurface.]] --&gt;
Since the atomic radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only slightly less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When [[raster graphics]] became affordable, one of the common approaches was to replicate CPK models ''[[in silico]]''. It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the [[molecular volume]] can be calculated.

The use of spheres is often for convenience, being limited both by graphics libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to see images of surfaces that have been colored to show quantities such as [[electrostatic potential]]. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include [[solvent-accessible surface|solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces]], [[solvent-excluded surface|solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces]], and [[isosurface]]s. The isosurface in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms to be seen and identified and it is not easy to deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.

==Technology==
Early interactive molecular computer graphics systems were [[vector graphics]] machines, which used stroke-writing [[vector monitor]]s, sometimes even oscilloscopes.  The electron beam does not sweep left-and-right as in a raster display.  The display hardware followed a sequential list of digital drawing instructions (the display list), directly drawing at an angle one stroke for each molecular bond.  When the list was complete, drawing would begin again from the top of the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), the display would flicker heavily.  Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in the display list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in the display unit, and the display unit would multiply all coordinates in the display list by the contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.

The early black-and white vector displays could somewhat distinguish for example a molecular structure from its surrounding electron density map for crystallographic structure solution work by drawing the molecule brighter than the map.  Color display makes them easier to tell apart.  During the 1970s two-color stroke-writing [[Penetron]] tubes were available, but not used in molecular computer graphics systems.  In about 1980 [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] made the first practical full-color vector displays for molecular graphics, typically attached to an E&amp;S PS-2 or MPS (MPS or Multi-Picture-System refers to several displays using a common graphics processor rack) graphics processor.  This early color display (the CSM or Color-Shadow-Mask) was expensive (around $50,000), because it was originally engineered to withstand the shaking of a flight-simulator motion base and because the vector scan was driven by a pair (X,Y) of 1Kw amplifiers. These systems required frequent maintenance and the wise user signed a flat rate Service Contract with E&amp;S. The newer E&amp;S PS-300 series graphics processors used less expensive color displays with raster scan technology and the entire system could be purchased for less than the older CSM display alone.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Sutherland PS-300 product literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Color raster graphics display of molecular models began around 1978 as seen in this paper by Porter&lt;ref name="Porter1978"/&gt; on spherical shading of atomic models.  Early raster molecular graphics systems displayed static images that could take around a minute to generate.  Dynamically rotating color raster molecular display phased in during 1982-1985 with the introduction of the Ikonas programmable raster display.

Molecular graphics has always pushed the limits of display technology, and has seen a number of cycles of integration and separation of compute-host and display. Early systems like Project MAC were [[bespoke]] and unique, but in the 1970s the MMS-X and similar systems used (relatively) low-cost terminals, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]] series, often over [[dial-up]] lines to multi-user hosts. The devices could only display static pictures but were able to evangelize MG. In the late 1970s, it was possible for departments (such as crystallography) to afford their own hosts (e.g., [[PDP-11]]) and to attach a display (such as [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]]'s PS-1) directly to the [[Computer bus|bus]]. The [[display list]] was kept on the host, and interactivity was good since updates were rapidly reflected in the display—at the cost of reducing most machines to a single-user system.

In the early 1980s, Evans &amp; Sutherland (E&amp;S) decoupled their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own display information transformable through a [[dataflow]] architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a [[serial line]] (e.g. 9600, 56K [[baud]]) or Ethernet interface and then manipulated without impact on the host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months trying to fit such activities into this architecture. E&amp;S designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine in an attempt to simplify this process but it was so difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;E&amp;S PS-300 Field Service documents&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits for MG were considerable, but by the later 1980s, [[UNIX]] [[workstations]] such as [[Sun-3]] with [[raster graphics]] (initially at a [[Image resolution|resolution]] of 256 by 256) had started to appear. Computer-assisted [[drug design]] in particular required raster graphics for the display of computed properties such as atomic [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[electrostatic potential]]. Although E&amp;S had a high-end range of raster graphics (primarily aimed at the [[aerospace]] industry) they failed to respond to the low-end market challenge where single users, rather than engineering departments, bought workstations. As a result, the market for MG displays passed to [[Silicon Graphics]], coupled with the development of [[minisupercomputer]]s (e.g., [[Convex Computer|CONVEX]] and [[Alliant Computer Systems|Alliant]]) which were affordable for well-supported MG laboratories. Silicon Graphics provided a graphics language, IrisGL, which was easier to use and more productive than the PS300 architecture. Commercial companies (e.g., Biosym, Polygen/MSI) ported their code to Silicon Graphics, and by the early 1990s, this was the "industry standard". [[Dial box]]es were often used as control devices.

[[Stereopsis|Stereoscopic displays]] were developed based on [[liquid crystal]] [[polarizer|polarized]] spectacles, and while this had been very expensive on the PS2, it now became a commodity item. A common alternative was to add a polarizable screen to the front of the display and to provide viewers with extremely cheap spectacles with [[orthogonal]] polarization for separate eyes. With projectors such as [[Barco stereoscopic projector|Barco]], it was possible to project stereoscopic display onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way molecular graphics became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.

In the last decade almost all of this technology has become commoditized. IrisGL evolved to [[OpenGL]] so that molecular graphics can be run on any machine. In 1992, Roger Sayle released his [[RasMol]] program into the public domain. RasMol contained a very high-performance molecular [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderer]] that ran on Unix/[[X Window]], and Sayle later ported this to the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platforms. The Richardsons developed [[kinemage]]s and the Mage software, which was also multi-platform.  By specifying the chemical [[MIME type]], molecular models could be served over the Internet, so that for the first time MG could be distributed at zero cost regardless of platform. In 1995, [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]'s crystallography department used this to run "Principles of Protein Structure", the first multimedia course on the Internet, which reached 100 to 200 scientists.

MG continues to see innovation that balances technology and art, and currently zero-cost or [[Open-source software|open source]] programs such as [[PyMOL]] and [[Jmol]] have very wide use and acceptance.

Recently the widespread diffusion of advanced [[graphics hardware]] has improved the rendering capabilities of the visualization tools. The capabilities of current [[shader|shading languages]] allow the inclusion of advanced graphic effects (like [[ambient occlusion]], [[shadow|cast shadows]] and [[non-photorealistic rendering]] techniques) in the [[interactive visualization]] of molecules. These graphic effects, beside being [[Attractiveness|eye candy]], can improve the comprehension of the three-dimensional shapes of the molecules. An example of the effects that can be achieved exploiting recent graphics hardware can be seen in the simple open source visualization system [[QuteMol]].

==Algorithms==

===Reference frames===
Drawing molecules requires a transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in [[Angstrom]] units) and the screen. Because many molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] it is essential that the handedness of the system (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate is out of the screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.

Molecular transformations normally require:

* scaling of the display (but not the molecule).
* translations of the molecule and objects on the screen.
* rotations about points and lines.

Conformational changes (e.g. rotations about bonds) require rotation of one part of the molecule relative to another. The programmer must decide whether a transformation on the screen reflects a change of view or a change in the molecule or its reference frame.

===Simple===
[[File:JmolStick.PNG|left|thumb|Fig. 7. Stick model of caffeine drawn in Jmol.]]
In early displays only vectors could be drawn e.g. (Fig. 7) which are easy to draw because no rendering or hidden surface removal is required.

On vector machines the lines would be smooth but on raster devices [[Bresenham's line algorithm|Bresenham's]] algorithm is used (note the "jaggies" on some of the bonds, which can be largely removed with [[Spatial anti-aliasing|antialiasing]] software.)

Atoms can be drawn as circles, but these should be sorted so that those with the largest z-coordinates (nearest the screen) are drawn last. Although imperfect, this often gives a reasonably attractive display. Other simple tricks which do not include hidden surface algorithms are:

* coloring each end of a bond with the same color as the atom to which it is attached (Fig. 7).
* drawing less than the whole length of the bond (e.g. 10%-90%) to simulate the bond sticking out of a circle.
* adding a small offset white circle within the circle for an atom to simulate reflection.

Typical [[pseudocode]] for creating Fig. 7 (to fit the molecule exactly to the screen):

 // assume:
 // atoms with x, y, z coordinates (Angstrom) and elementSymbol
 // bonds with pointers/references to atoms at ends
 // table of colors for elementTypes
 // find limits of molecule in molecule coordinates as xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax
 scale = min(xScreenMax/(xMax-xMin), yScreenMax/(yMax-yMin))
 xOffset = -xMin * scale; yOffset = -yMin * scale
 for (bond in $bonds) {
   atom0 = bond.getAtom(0)
   atom1 = bond.getAtom(1)
   x0 = xOffset+atom0.getX()*scale; y0 = yOffset+atom0.getY()*scale // (1)
   x1 = xOffset+atom1.getX()*scale; y1 = yOffset+atom1.getY()*scale // (2)
   x1 = atom1.getX();  y1 = atom1.getY()
   xMid = (x0 + x1) /2;  yMid = (y0 + y1) /2;
   color0 = ColorTable.getColor(atom0.getSymbol())
   drawLine (color0, x0, y0, xMid, yMid)
   color1 = ColorTable.getColor(atom1.getSymbol())
   drawLine (color1, x1, y1, xMid, yMid)
 }

Note that this assumes the origin is in the bottom left corner of the screen, with Y up the screen. Many graphics systems have the origin at the top left, with Y down the screen. In this case the lines (1) and (2) should have the y coordinate generation as:
  y0 = yScreenMax -(yOffset+atom0.getY()*scale) // (1)
  y1 = yScreenMax -(yOffset+atom1.getY()*scale) // (2)
Changes of this sort change the handedness of the axes so it is easy to reverse the chirality of the displayed molecule unless care is taken.

===Advanced===
For greater realism and better comprehension of the 3D structure of a molecule many [[computer graphics]] algorithms can be used. For many years molecular graphics has stressed the capabilities of graphics hardware and has required hardware-specific approaches. With the increasing power of machines on the desktop, portability is more important and programs such as [[Jmol]] have advanced algorithms that do not rely on hardware. On the other hand, recent graphics hardware is able to interactively render very complex molecule shapes with a quality that would not be possible with standard software techniques.

===Electronic Richards Box Systems===
Before [[computer graphics]] could be employed,{{when|date=June 2014}} mechanical methods were used to fit large molecules to their electron density maps. Using techniques of [[X-ray crystallography]] crystal of a substance were bombarded with [[X-ray]]s, and the diffracted beams that came off were assembled by computer using a [[Fourier transform]] into a usually blurry 3-D image of the molecule, made visible by drawing contour circles around high electron density to produce a contoured electron density map.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the earliest days, contoured electron density maps were hand drawn on large plastic sheets.  Sometimes, [[bingo chip]]s were placed on the plastic sheets where atoms were interpreted to be.

This was superseded by the Richards Box&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Frederic_M._Richards | title=Richards, Frederic M. | work=Protopedia | accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an adjustable brass Kendrew molecular model was placed front of a 2-way mirror, behind which were plastic sheets of the electron density map.  This optically superimposed the molecular model and the electron density map.  The model was moved to within the contour lines of the superimposed map.  Then, atomic coordinates were recorded using a plumb bob and a meter stick.
Computer graphics held out the hope of vastly speeding up this process, as well as giving a clearer view in many ways.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A noteworthy attempt to overcome the low speed of graphics displays of the time{{when|date=June 2014}} took place at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]], USA.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Dave Barry's group attempted to leapfrog the state of the art in graphics displays by making custom display hardware to display images complex enough for large-molecule crystallographic structure solution, fitting molecules to their electron-density maps.  The MMS-4 (table above) display modules were slow and expensive, so a second generation of modules was produced for the MMS-X (table above) system.

The first large molecule whose atomic structure was ''partly'' determined on a molecular computer graphics system was Transfer RNA by [[Kim Sung-Hou|Sung-Hou Kim]]'s team in 1976.&lt;ref name=Sussman1976a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussman1976b/&gt; after initial fitting on a mechanical Richards Box. The first large molecule whose atomic structure was ''entirely'' determined on a molecular computer graphics system is said to be neurotoxin A from venom of the Philippines sea snake, by Tsernoglou, [[Gregory Petsko|Petsko]], and Tu,&lt;ref name=Tsernoglou1977a/&gt; with a statement of being first&lt;ref name=Tsernoglou1977b/&gt; in 1977. The [[Jane S. Richardson|Richardson]] group published partial atomic structure results&lt;ref name=Richardson1977/&gt; of the protein superoxide dismutase the same year, in 1977.  All of these were done using the GRIP-75 system.

Other structure fitting systems, FRODO, RING, Builder, MMS-X, etc. (table above) succeeded as well within three years{{when|date=June 2014}} and became dominant.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The reason that most of these systems succeeded in just those years,{{when|date=June 2014}} not earlier or later, and within a short timespan had to do with the arrival of commercial hardware that was powerful enough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Two things were needed and arrived at about the same time.  First, electron density maps are large and require either a computer with at least a 24-bit address space or a combination of a computer with a lesser 16-bit address space plus several years to overcome the difficulties of an address space that is smaller than the data.  The second arrival was that of interactive computer graphics displays that were fast enough to display electron-density maps, whose contour circles require the display of numerous short vectors. The first such displays were the Vector General Series 3 and the Evans and Sutherland Picture System 2, MultiPicture System, and PS-300.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Nowadays,{{when|date=June 2014}} fitting of the molecular structure to the electron density map is largely automated by algorithms with computer graphics a guide to the process.  An example is the [[XtalView]] [[XFit]] program.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''NanoInk, Inc.''' was a [[nanotechnology]] company headquartered in [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], Illinois, with a [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] fabrication facility in [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], California.

A spin-off of [[Northwestern University]] and founded by Northwestern professor [[Chad Mirkin]], '''NanoInk''' specialized in nanometer-scale manufacturing and applications development for the life science and semiconductor industries. [[Dip Pen Nanolithography]] (DPN) was a patented and proprietary nanofabrication technology{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} marketed as an anti-counterfeiting aid for pharmaceutical products.

Other key applications included nanoscale additive repair and nanoscale rapid prototyping.  Located in the [[Illinois Science + Technology Park]], north of [[Chicago]], NanoInk had nearly 400 [[patent]]s and applications filed worldwide and had licensing agreements with [[Northwestern University]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Illinois]] at Urbana-Champaign, and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].

Within seven months of its formation, the firm released its first product, the DPN-System-1, which turned any atomic force microscope into a DPN machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltimes.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=268097&amp;p=109 Small Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, NanoInk announced it would be shutting down due to insufficient funding when its primary backer, Ann Lurie, decided to pull the plug after investing $150 million over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130222/BLOGS11/130229924/nanoink-folds-as-ann-luries-investment-runs-out&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">'''Nitro Zeus''' is a project name for a well funded comprehensive [[cyberattack|cyber attack]] plan created as a mitigation strategy after the [[Stuxnet]] malware campaign and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://uk.businessinsider.com/nitro-zeus-iran-infrastructure-2016-7 | title = The US could have destroyed Iran's entire infrastructure without dropping a single bomb | date = 2016-07-06 | first = Paul | last = Szoldra | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Stuxnet, that was loaded onto a system after the design phase to affect its proper operation, Nitro Zeus's objectives are built into a system during the design phase unbeknownst to the system users. This built-in feature allows a more assured and effective cyber attack against the system's users.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Gibney ''Zero Days'' documentary film&lt;/ref&gt;

The information about its existence was raised during research and interviews carried out by Alex Gibney for his ''[[Zero Days]]'' documentary film. The proposed long term widespread infiltration of major Iranian systems would disrupt and degrade communications, power grid, and other vital systems as desired by the cyber attackers. This was to be achieved by electronic implants in Iranian computer networks. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/us-had-cyberattack-planned-if-iran-nuclear-negotiations-failed.html | date = 2016-02-17 | title = US Had Cyberattack Planned if Iran Nuclear Negotiations Failed | first1 = David | last = Sanger | first2 = Mark | last2 = Mazzetti | work = New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was seen as one pathway in alternatives to full-scale war. There was no requirement for this type of plan after the [[Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action|Iran Nuclear Deal]] was signed, though any functioning implants in Iran's critical [[SCADA]] infrastructure systems are not likely to be removed.

'''Philosophy and Belief''' is a school subject taught at schools across [[South America]]. The subject bears many similarities to [[Religious Education]] (RE), a subject taught across the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Countries. Its main differences are that it has more emphasis on areas such as [[debating]], [[moral]] and [[philosophical]] issues and [[dilemmas]], [[wars]], and [[philosophy]] concerning [[life and death]]. It also looks at [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[religion]] in the media.

It has received criticism for not teaching enough about religion. However, there are others who argue that it does, in a more engaging and fun way. Overall, teaching students about [[life skills]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30003">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], '''primitive recursive functions''' are a class of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that are defined using [[function composition|composition]] and '''primitive recursion''' – described below – as central operations. They are a strict [[subset]] of those [[µ-recursive function]]s (also called [[computable function|partial recursive functions]]) which are also [[total function]]s. Primitive recursive functions form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability.  These functions are also important in [[proof theory]].

Most of the functions normally studied in [[number theory]] are primitive recursive. For example, [[addition]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]], the [[factorial]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] function, and the function which returns the ''n''th prime are all primitive recursive. So are many approximations to real-valued functions.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd and Landweber, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is difficult to devise a [[computable function|total recursive function]] that is ''not'' primitive recursive, although some are known (see the section on [[Primitive recursive function#Limitations|Limitations]] below).
The set of primitive recursive functions is known as [[PR (complexity)|PR]] in [[computational complexity theory]].

== Definition ==
The primitive recursive functions are among the number-theoretic functions, which are functions from the [[natural number]]s (nonnegative integers) {0, 1, 2, ...} to the natural numbers. These functions take ''n'' arguments for some natural number ''n'' and are called ''n''-[[arity|ary]].

The basic primitive recursive functions are given by these [[axiom]]s:

{{ordered list|start=1
| 1='''Constant function''': The 0-ary [[constant term|constant function]] 0 is primitive recursive.
| 2='''Successor function''': The 1-ary successor function ''S'', which returns the successor of its argument (see [[Peano postulates]]), is primitive recursive. That is, ''S''(''k'') = ''k'' + 1.
| 3='''Projection function''': For every ''n''≥1 and each ''i'' with 1≤''i''≤''n'', the ''n''-ary projection function ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which returns its ''i''-th argument, is primitive recursive.
}}
More complex primitive recursive functions can be obtained by applying the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s given by these axioms:
{{ordered list|start=4
| 4='''Composition''': Given a ''k''-ary primitive recursive function ''f'', and ''k'' many ''m''-ary primitive recursive functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''f'' with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. the ''m''-ary function &lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\ldots,x_m) = f(g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_m),\ldots,g_k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)) \,&lt;/math&gt; is primitive recursive.
}}
Example. We take ''f''(''x'') as the ''S''(''x'') defined above. This f is a 1-ary primitive recursive function. And so is ''g''(''x'') = ''S''(''x''). So ''h''(''x'') defined as ''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''S''(''S''(''x'')) is a primitive recursive 1-ary function too. Informally speaking, ''h''(''x'') is the function that turns ''x'' into ''x''+2.
{{ordered list|start=5
| 5='''Primitive recursion''': Given ''f'', a ''k''-ary primitive recursive function, and ''g'', a (''k''+2)-ary primitive recursive function, the (''k''+1)-ary function ''h'' is defined as the primitive recursion of ''f'' and ''g'', i.e. the function ''h'' is primitive recursive when
:&lt;math&gt;h (0, x_1, \ldots, x_k) = f (x_1, \ldots, x_k) \,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;h (S(y), x_1, \ldots, x_k) = g (y, h (y, x_1, \ldots, x_k), x_1, \ldots, x_k) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Example. Suppose ''f''(''x'') = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = ''x'' and ''g''(''x'',''y'',''z'')= ''S''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'',''y'',''z'')) = ''S''(''y''). Then ''h''(0,''x'') = ''x'' and ''h''(''S''(''y''),''x'') = ''g''(''y'',''h''(''y'',''x''),''x'') = ''S''(''h''(''y'',''x'')). Now ''h''(0,1) = 1, ''h''(1,1) = ''S''(''h''(0,1)) = 2, ''h''(2,1) = ''S''(''h''(1,1)) = 3. This ''h'' is a 2-ary primitive recursive function. We can call it 'addition'.

The '''primitive recursive''' functions are the basic functions and those obtained from the basic functions by applying these operations a finite number of times.

=== Role of the projection functions ===
The projection functions can be used to avoid the apparent rigidity in terms of the [[arity]] of the functions above; by using compositions with various projection functions, it is possible to pass a subset of the arguments of one function to another function.  For example, if ''g'' and ''h'' are 2-ary primitive recursive functions then
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b,c) = g(h(c,a),h(a,b)) \!&lt;/math&gt;
is also primitive recursive.  One formal definition using projection functions is
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,b,c) = g(h(P^3_3(a,b,c),P^3_1(a,b,c)),h(P^3_1(a,b,c),P^3_2(a,b,c))).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Converting predicates to numeric functions ===

In some settings it is natural to consider primitive recursive functions that take as inputs tuples that mix numbers with [[truth value]]s (that is ''t'' for true and ''f'' for false), or that produce truth values as outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene [1952 pp.&amp;nbsp;226–227]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be accomplished by identifying the truth values with numbers in any fixed manner.  For example, it is common to identify the truth value ''t'' with the number 1 and the truth value ''f'' with the number 0.  Once this identification has been made, the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of a set ''A'', which always returns 1 or 0, can be viewed as a predicate that tells whether a number is in the set ''A''.  Such an identification of predicates with numeric functions will be assumed for the remainder of this article.

=== Computer language definition ===

An example of a primitive recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic [[for loop]], where there is a known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as [[while loop]]s or IF-THEN plus [[GOTO]], are admitted in a primitive recursive language. [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s [[BlooP and FlooP|BlooP]] in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' is one such.  Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]]; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.

Arbitrary computer programs, or [[Turing machine]]s, cannot in general be analyzed to see if they halt or not (the [[halting problem]]).  However, all primitive recursive functions halt. This is not a contradiction; primitive recursive programs are a non-arbitrary subset of all possible programs, constructed specifically to be analyzable.

== Examples ==

Most number-theoretic functions definable using [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] on a single variable are primitive recursive.  Basic examples include the addition and [[truncated subtraction]] functions.

=== Addition ===
Intuitively, addition can be recursively defined with the rules:

:&lt;math&gt;add(0,x)=x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;add(n+1,x)=add(n,x)+1&lt;/math&gt;

To fit this into a strict primitive recursive definition, define:

:&lt;math&gt;add(0,x)=P_1^1(x),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;add(S(n),x)=S(P_2^3(n, add(n,x), x))&lt;/math&gt;

Here S(''n'') is "the successor of ''n''" (i.e., ''n''+1), ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[identity function]], and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[projection function]] that takes 3 arguments and returns the second one. Functions ''f'' and ''g'' required by the above definition of the primitive recursion operation are respectively played by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the composition of ''S'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Subtraction ===
{{See also|Monus}}
Because primitive recursive functions use natural numbers rather than integers, and the natural numbers are not closed under subtraction, a truncated subtraction function (also called "proper subtraction") is studied in this context. This limited subtraction function sub(''a'', ''b'') [or ''b'' ∸ ''a''] returns ''b'' - ''a'' if this is nonnegative and returns ''0'' otherwise.

The '''predecessor function''' acts as the opposite of the successor function and is recursively defined by the rules:

:pred(0) = 0,
:pred(''n'' + 1) = ''n''.

These rules can be converted into a more formal definition by primitive recursion:

:pred(0) = 0,
:pred(S(''n'')) = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', pred(''n'')).

The limited subtraction function is definable from the predecessor function in a manner analogous to the way addition is defined from successor:

:sub(0, ''x'') = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), 
:sub(S(''n''), ''x'') = pred(''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', sub(''n'', ''x''), ''x'')).

Here sub(''a'',  ''b'') corresponds to ''b'' ∸ ''a''; for the sake of simplicity, the order of the arguments has been switched from the "standard" definition to fit the requirements of primitive recursion. This could easily be rectified using composition with suitable projections.

=== Other operations on natural numbers ===

[[Exponentiation]] and [[primality test]]ing are primitive recursive. Given primitive recursive functions ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', and ''h'', a function that returns the value of ''g'' when ''e''≤''f'' and the value of ''h'' otherwise is primitive recursive.

=== Operations on integers and rational numbers ===

By using [[Gödel numbering]]s, the primitive recursive functions can be extended to operate on other objects such as integers and [[rational number]]s.  If integers are encoded by Gödel numbers in a standard way, the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all primitive recursive.  Similarly, if the rationals are represented by Gödel numbers then the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] operations are all primitive recursive.

== Use in first-order Peano arithmetic ==
In [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano arithmetic]], there are infinitely many variables (0-ary symbols) but no [[arity|k-ary]] non-logical symbols with k&gt;0 other than S, +, *, and ≤. Thus in order to define primitive recursive functions one has to use the following trick by Gödel.

By using a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]], for example [[Gödel's β function]], any sequence of numbers can be encoded by a single number. Such a number can therefore represent the primitive recursive function until a given n.

Let ''h'' be a 1-ary primitive recursion function defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; h(0) = C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; h(n+1) = g(n,h(n))&lt;/math&gt;
where C is a constant and ''g'' is an already defined function.

Using Gödel's β function, for any sequence of natural numbers (k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), there are natural numbers b and c such that, for every i ≤ n, β(b, c, i) = k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. We may thus use the following formula to define ''h''; more precisely, ''m''=''h''(''n'') is a shorthand for the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists b: \exists c: \beta(b, c, 0) = C \land \forall i: (i&lt;n) \rightarrow (\beta(b, c, i+1) = g(i,\beta(b, c, i))) \land (m = \beta(b, c, n))&lt;/math&gt;
and the equating to ''g'', being already defined, is in fact shorthand for some other already defined formula (as is β, whose formula is given [[Gödel's β function|here]]).

The generalization to any k-ary primitive recursion function is trivial.

== Relationship to recursive functions ==

The broader class of [[partial recursive function]]s is defined by introducing an [[mu operator|unbounded search operator]].  The use of this operator may result in a [[partial function]], that is, a relation with ''at most'' one value for each argument, but does not necessarily have ''any'' value for any argument (see [[Domain of a function|domain]]).  An equivalent definition states that a partial recursive function is one that can be computed by a [[Turing machine]].  A total recursive function is a partial recursive function that is defined for every input.

Every primitive recursive function is total recursive, but not all total recursive functions are primitive recursive. The [[Ackermann function]] ''A''(''m'',''n'') is a well-known example of a total recursive function (in fact, provable total), that is not primitive recursive. There is a characterization of the primitive recursive functions as a subset of the total recursive functions using the Ackermann function.  This characterization states that a function is primitive recursive [[if and only if]] there is a natural number ''m'' such that the function can be computed by a Turing [[machine that always halts]] within A(''m'',''n'') or fewer steps, where ''n'' is the sum of the arguments of the primitive recursive function.&lt;ref&gt;This follows from the facts that the functions of this form are the most quickly growing primitive recursive functions, and that a function is primitive recursive if and only if its time complexity is bounded by a primitive recursive function. For the former, see {{citation|title=An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata|first=Peter|last=Linz|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781449615529|page=332|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsxDiWvVdBcC&amp;pg=PA332}}. For the latter, see {{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780191620805|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnGKbpMV8xoC&amp;pg=PA287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important property of the primitive recursive functions is that they are a [[recursively enumerable]] subset of the set of all [[total recursive function]]s (which is not itself recursively enumerable). This means that there is a single computable function ''f''(''m'',''n'') that enumerates the primitive recursive functions, namely:
* For every primitive recursive function ''g'', there is an ''m'' such that ''g''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') for all ''n'', and
* For every ''m'', the function ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') is primitive recursive.
''f'' can be explicitly constructed by iteratively repeating all possible ways of creating primitive recursive functions. Thus, it is provably total. One can use a [[diagonal lemma|diagonalization]] argument to show that ''f'' is not recursive primitive in itself: had it been such, so would be ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''n'',''n'')+1. But if this equals some primitive recursive function, there is an ''m'' such that ''h''(''n'') = ''f''(''m'',''n'') for all ''n'', and then ''h''(''m'') = ''f''(''m'',''m''), leading to contradiction.

However, the set of primitive recursive functions is not the ''largest'' recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions. For example, the set of provably total functions (in Peano arithmetic) is also recursively enumerable, as one can enumerate all the proofs of the theory. While all primitive recursive functions are provably total, the converse is not true.

== Limitations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Primitive recursive function]] --&gt;

Primitive recursive functions tend to correspond very closely with our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also very straightforward. However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function—this can be seen with a variant of [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows:

:The primitive recursive functions of one argument (i.e., unary functions) can be [[Recursively enumerable set|computably enumerated]]. This enumeration uses the definitions of the primitive recursive functions (which are essentially just expressions with the composition and primitive recursion operations as operators and the basic primitive recursive functions as atoms), and can be assumed to contain every definition once, even though a same ''function'' will occur many times on the list (since many definitions define the same function; indeed simply composing by the [[identity function]] generates infinitely many definitions of any one primitive recursive function). This means that the {{mvar|''n''}}-th definition of a primitive recursive function in this enumeration can be effectively determined from {{mvar|''n''}}. Indeed if one uses some [[Gödel numbering]] to encode definitions as numbers, then this {{mvar|''n''}}-th definition in the list is computed by a primitive recursive function of {{mvar|''n''}}. Let {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the unary primitive recursive function given by this definition.

:Now define the "evaluator function" {{mvar|''ev''}} with two arguments, by {{math|''ev''(''i'',''j'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'')}}. Clearly {{math|''ev''}} is total and computable, since one can effectively determine the definition of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and being a primitive recursive function {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is itself total and computable, so {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'')}} is always defined and effectively computable. However a diagonal argument will show that the function {{mvar|''ev''}} of two arguments is not primitive recursive.

:Suppose {{mvar|''ev''}} were primitive recursive, then the unary function {{mvar|''g''}} defined by {{math|''g''(''i'') {{=}} S(''ev''(''i'',''i''))}} would also be primitive recursive, as it is defined by composition from the successor function and {{mvar|''ev''}}. But then {{mvar|''g''}} occurs in the enumeration, so there is some number {{mvar|''n''}} such that {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. But now {{math|''g''(''n'') {{=}} S(''ev''(''n'',''n'')) {{=}} S(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')) {{=}} S(''g''(''n''))}} gives a contradiction.

This argument can be applied to any class of computable (total) functions that can be enumerated in this way, as explained in the article [[Machines that always halt]]. Note however that the ''partial'' computable functions (those that need not be defined for all arguments) can be explicitly enumerated, for instance by enumerating Turing machine encodings.

Other examples of total recursive but not primitive recursive functions are known:
*The function that takes ''m'' to [[Ackermann function|Ackermann]](''m'',''m'') is a unary total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.
*The [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] involves a total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.  Because this function is motivated by [[Ramsey theory]], it is sometimes considered more "natural" than the Ackermann function.
*The [[Sudan function]]
*The [[Goodstein function]]

== Some common primitive recursive functions ==

:The following examples and definitions are from Kleene (1952) pp.&amp;nbsp;223–231 — many appear with proofs. Most also appear with similar names, either as proofs or as examples, in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002 pp.&amp;nbsp;63–70; they add #22 the logarithm lo(x, y) or lg(x, y) depending on the exact derivation.

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be of four types:
# ''functions'' for short: "number-theoretic functions" from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...},
# ''predicates'': from { 0, 1, 2, ...} to truth values { t =true, f =false },
# ''propositional connectives'': from truth values { t, f } to truth values { t, f },
# ''representing functions'': from truth values { t, f } to { 0, 1, 2, ... }. Many times a predicate requires a representing function to convert the predicate's output { t, f } to { 0, 1 } (note the order "t" to "0" and "f" to "1" matches with ~sg( ) defined below). By definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values 0 and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

In the following the mark " ' ", e.g. a', is the primitive mark meaning "the successor of", usually thought of as " +1", e.g. a +1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; a'. The functions 16-20 and #G are of particular interest with respect to converting primitive recursive predicates to, and extracting them from, their "arithmetical" form expressed as [[Gödel number]]s.

:# Addition: a+b
:# Multiplication: a×b
:# Exponentiation: a&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;
:# Factorial a! : 0! = 1, a'! = a!×a'
:# pred(a): (Predecessor or decrement): If a &gt; 0 then a-1 else 0
:# Proper subtraction a ∸ b: If a ≥ b then a-b else 0
:# Minimum(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
:# Maximum(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
:# Absolute difference: | a-b | =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; (a ∸ b) + (b ∸ a)
:# ~sg(a): NOT[signum(a)]: If a=0 then 1 else 0
:# sg(a): signum(a): If a=0 then 0 else 1
:# a | b: (a divides b): If b=k×a for some k then 0 else 1
:# Remainder(a, b): the leftover if b does not divide a "evenly".  Also called MOD(a, b)
:# a = b: sg | a - b |  (Kleene's convention was to represent ''true'' by 0 and ''false'' by 1; presently, especially in computers, the most common convention is the reverse, namely to represent ''true'' by 1 and ''false'' by 0, which amounts to changing sg into ~sg here and in the next item)
:# a &lt; b: sg( a' ∸ b )
:# Pr(a): a is a prime number Pr(a) =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt;  a&gt;1 &amp; NOT(Exists c)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;c&lt;a&lt;/sub&gt; [ c|a ]
:# p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: the i+1-st prime number
:# (a)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: exponent of p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in a: the unique x such that p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;|a &amp; NOT(p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x'&lt;/sup&gt;|a)

'So, in a sense the knowledge of the value NOT-φ(y; '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt; ) of the course-of-values function is equivalent to the knowledge of the sequence of values φ(0,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., φ(y-1,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;) of the original function."

== Additional primitive recursive forms ==

Some additional forms of recursion also define functions that are in fact
primitive recursive.  Definitions in these forms may be easier to find or
more natural for reading or writing. [[Course-of-values recursion]] defines primitive recursive functions. Some forms of [[mutual recursion]] also define primitive recursive functions.

The functions that can be programmed in the [[LOOP (programming language)|LOOP programming language]] are exactly the primitive recursive functions. This gives a different characterization of the power of these functions. The main limitation of the LOOP language, compared to a [[Turing-complete language]], is that in the LOOP language the number of times that each loop will run is specified before the loop begins to run.

== Finitism and consistency results ==

The primitive recursive functions are closely related to mathematical [[finitism]], and are used in several contexts in mathematical logic where a particularly constructive system is desired. [[Primitive recursive arithmetic]] (PRA), a formal axiom system for the natural numbers and the primitive recursive functions on them, is often used for this purpose.

PRA is much weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which is not a finitistic system. Nevertheless, many results in [[number theory]] and in [[proof theory]] can be proved in PRA. For example, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] can be formalized into PRA, giving the following theorem:
:If ''T'' is a theory of arithmetic satisfying certain hypotheses, with Gödel sentence ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, then PRA proves the implication Con(''T'')&amp;rarr;''G''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;.
Similarly, many of the syntactic results in proof theory can be proved in PRA, which implies that there are primitive recursive functions that carry out the corresponding syntactic transformations of proofs.

In proof theory and [[set theory]], there is an interest in finitistic [[consistency proof]]s, that is, consistency proofs that themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a proof establishes that the consistency of a theory ''T'' implies the consistency of a theory ''S'' by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from ''S'' into a proof of an inconsistency from ''T''.  One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic is the ability to formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] can be recast as syntactic proofs that can be formalized in PRA.

== History ==
[[Recursive definition]]s had been used more or less formally in mathematics before, but the construction of primitive recursion is traced back to [[Richard Dedekind]]'s theorem 126 of his ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' (1888). This work was the first to give a proof that a certain recursive construction defines a unique function.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Smith|title=An Introduction to Gödel's Theorems|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02284-3|pages=98–99|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tourlakis2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Tourlakis|title=Lectures in Logic and Set Theory: Volume 1, Mathematical Logic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43942-8|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downey2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rod Downey|title=Turing's Legacy: Developments from Turing's Ideas in Logic|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04348-0|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primitive recursive arithmetic]]  was first proposed by [[Thoralf Skolem]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thoralf Skolem]] (1923) "The foundations of elementary arithmetic" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], translator and ed. (1967) ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 302-33.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923.

The current terminology was coined by [[Rózsa Péter]] (1934) after Ackermann had proved in 1928 that the function which today is named after him was not primitive recursive, an event which prompted the need to rename what until then were simply called recursive functions.&lt;ref name="Tourlakis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Downey2014"/&gt;

'''Print design''', a subset of [[graphic design]], is a form of [[visual communication]] used to convey information to an audience through intentional aesthetic design printed on a tangible surface, designed to be printed on paper, as opposed to presented on a digital platform. A design can be considered print design if its final form was created through an imprint made by the impact of a stamp, seal, or dye on the surface of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;"print, n. and adj.2." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 30 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are several methods used to create print design artworks, spanning more than five hundred years. Printing technologies available throughout history heavily influenced the style of designs created by [[graphic designer]]s at the time of production, as different methods of creating print design offer varying features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hollis, Richard''. Graphic Design: A Concise History''. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the emergence of the design and printing technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first century such as the [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[Adobe InDesign]], print design relied on mechanical technologies such as the letterpress and lithography.

=== Letterpress ===
[[File:Letterpress from earliest days of printing (25794045595).jpg|thumb|Letterpress from the earliest days of printing]]
[[File:15020-Virgil Scott Letterpress Exhibit 4677 (16217955040).jpg|thumb|Metal type blocks arranged for printing with a letterpress]]
The [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], perfected in the mid fifteenth century by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398-1468) through the combined use of the printing press, oil-based inks, and cast metal type, remained the most common and efficient method of printing until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Eskilson, Stephen. ''Graphic Design: A New History''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Used frequently with [[typography]] design and type layout, the letterpress operates through the stamping of type and photo-engraved metal blocks on paper. The metal blocks are arranged in a frame by the printer, and the text columns and etchings are separated by vertical or horizontal metal bars; it is even possible to arrange the blocks at an angle using a letterpress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Becker, Lutz, and Richard Hollis. ''Avant-Garde Graphics 1918-1934'': From the Merrill C. Berman Collection. London: Hayward Gallery, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the letterpress, print design and graphics remained black and white print on paper until the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The letterpress was the first technology that allowed for mass production and distribution of printed material at a large scale, and because of this, quickly replaced the slow processes of [[woodblock printing]] and hand copying of print design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lithography ===
[[File:Klingenberg Lithostein.jpg|thumb|Lithographic stone artwork]]
[[Lithography]], introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, allowed for the use of color in prints and allowed artists to print on larger surfaces than the letterpress. Additionally, lithography enabled artists to draw their own lettering on designs, which was not possible with the letterpress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design was drawn directly onto the stone by the artist, and then transferred onto the surface of the paper.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Print design remains prevalent in society through all forms of communicative design. The importance of printed visual design was highlighted during the first world war, as posters helped to inform and instruct the audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A short list of print design's uses today includes:
* [[Poster]]s
* [[Brochure]]s
* Flyers
* [[Packaging and labeling|Packaging labels]]
* [[Business card]]s
* [[Book cover]]s
* Book design and layout
* [[Magazine]]s
* [[Banner]]s
* Receipts
* [[Shopping bag]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law... British order | date = 2009-02-20 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt;

Procedurals are often criticized for being [[Wiktionary:formulaic|formulaic]].&lt;ref name="formulaic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="formulaover"&gt;{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5160IN20090207 | title = Networks' new pilots favor formula over experiment | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format.&lt;ref name="duelling"&gt;{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/duelling-sleuths/2006/08/08/1154802894078.html | title = Duelling sleuths | date = 2006-08-10 | work = [[The Age]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomystery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Carter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html?_r=1 | title = No Mystery: Ratings Heat Up for ‘NCIS’ | date = 2008-11-16 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a [[story arc]]).&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jason Hughes | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/23/what-if-house-stopped-being-a-procedural/ | title = What if House stopped being a procedural? | date = 2009-09-23 | work = [[TVSquad]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological statistics''' is application of formulas, theorems, numbers and laws to [[psychology]]. 
Statistical Methods for psychology include development and application statistical theory and methods for modeling psychological data. 
These methods include psychometrics, Factor analysis, Experimental Designs, Multivariate Behavioral Research. The article also discusses journals in the same field Wilcox, R. (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, R. (2012). Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences: A Practical Introduction. FL: CRC Press. {{isbn|9781439834565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychometrics==
{{Main article|Psychometrics}}
Psychometrics deals with measurement of psychological attributes. It involved developing and applying statistical models for mental measurements (Lord and Novik, ; etc.) The measurement theories are divided into two major areas: (1) Classical test theory; (2) Item Response Theory  (Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994). Psychometric Theory.  McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Classical Test Theory===
{{Main article|Classical test theory}}
The classical test theory or true score theory or reliability theory in statistics is a set of statistical procedures useful for development of psychological tests and scales. It is based on fundamental equation 
X = T + E
where, X is total score, T is a true score and E is error of measurement. For each participant, it assumes that there exist a true score and it need to be obtained score (X) has to be as close to it as possible (Lord, F. M. , and Novick, M. R. ( 1 968),&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. M. , and Novick, M. R. ( 1 968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Reading, Mass. : Addison-Wesley, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Raykov, T.  &amp; Marcoulides, G.A. (2010) &lt;ref&gt;Raykov, T.  &amp; Marcoulides, G.A. (2010) Introduction to Psychometric Theory. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; ). The closeness of X has with T is expressed in terms of ratability of the obtained score. The reliability in terms of classical test procedure is correlation between true score and obtained score. The typical test construction procedures has following steps:

(1)	Determine the construct 
(2)	Outline the behavioral domain of the construct
(3)	Write 3 to 5 times more items than desired test length
(4)	Get item content analyzed by experts and cull items
(5)	Obtain data on initial version of the test 
(6)	Item analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(7)	Factor analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(8)	After the second cull, make final version
(9)	Use it for research

====Reliability ====
{{Main article|Reliability (research methods)}}

The reliability is computed in specific ways.  
(A)	Inter-Rater reliability: Inter-Rater reliability is estimate of agreement between independent raters. This is most useful for subjective responses. Cohen’s Kappa, Krippendorff’s Alpha, Intra-Class correlation coefficients, Correlation coefficients, Kendal’s concordance coefficient, etc. are useful statistical tools. 
(B)	Test-Retest Reliability: Test-Retest Procedure is estimation of temporal consistency of the test. A test is administered twice to the same sample with a time interval. Correlation between two sets of scores is used as an estimate of reliability. Testing conditions are assumed to be identical. 
(C)	 Internal Consistency Reliability: Internal consistency reliability estimates consistency of items with each other. Split-half reliability (Spearman- Brown Prophecy) and Cronbach Alpha are popular estimates of this reliability . (Cronbach LJ (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach LJ (1951). Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests. Psychometrika 16, 297–334. doi:10.1007/bf02310555&lt;/ref&gt;). 
(D)	Parallel Form Reliability: It is an estimate of consistency between two different instruments of measurement. The inter-correlation between two parallel forms of a test or scale is used as an estimate of parallel form reliability.

====Validity====
{{Main article|Test validity}}

Validity of a scale or test is ability of the instrument to measure what it purports to measure (Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Construct validity, Content Validity, Criterion Validity are types of validity. 
Construct validity is estimated by convergent and discriminant validity and factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity are ascertained by correlation between similar of different constructs. 
Content Validity: Subject matter experts evaluate content validity. 
Criterion Validity is correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) of the construct. Regression analysis, Multiple regression analysis, Logistic regression is used as an estimate of criterion validity. 
Software applications: The R software has ‘psych’ package that is useful for classical test theory analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, T. J. B. (2005)Psychological Testing: A Practical Approach to Design and Evaluation. Sage Publications: Thousand Oaks.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern test Theory ===
{{Main article|Item Response Theory}}

The modern test theory is based on latent trait model. Every item estimates the ability of the test taker. The ability parameter is called as theta (θ). The difficulty parameter is called b. the two important assumptions are local independence and unidimensionality.   
The Item Response Theory has three models. They are one parameter logistic model, two parameter logistic model and three parameter logistic model. In addition, Polychromous IRT Model are also useful (Hambleton &amp; Swaminathan, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R. K., &amp; Swaminathan H. (1985). Item Response theory: Principles and Applications. Boston: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The R Software has ‘ltm’, packages useful for IRT analysis.

==Factor Analysis ==
{{Main article|Factor Analysis}}

Factor analysis is at the core of psychological statistics. It has two schools: (1) Exploratory Factor analysis (2) Confirmatory Factor analysis

===Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)===
{{Main article|Exploratory Factor Analysis}}
The exploratory factor analysis begins without a theory or with a very tentative theory. It is a dimension reduction technique. It is useful in psychometrics, multivariate analysis of data and data analytics. 
Typically a k-dimensional correlation matrix or covariance matrix of variables is reduced to k X r factor pattern matrix where r &lt; k. Principal Component analysis and common factor analysis are two ways of extracting data. Principal axis factoring, ML factor analysis, alpha factor analysis and image factor analysis is most useful ways of EFA. 
It employees various factor rotation methods which can be classified into orthogonal (resulting in uncorrelated factors) and oblique (resulting correlated factors).

The ‘psych’ package in R is useful for EFA.

===Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)===
{{Main article|Confirmatory Factor Analysis}}

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is factor analytic technique that begins with theory and test the theory by carrying out factor analysis. 
The CFA is also called as latent structure analysis, which considers factor as latent variables causing actual observable variables. The basic equation of the CFA is

X = Λξ + δ

where, X is observed variables, Λ are structural coefficients, ξ are latent variables (factors) and δ are errors. 
The parameters are estimated using ML methods however; other methods of estimation are also available. The chi-square test is very sensitive and hence various fit measures are used (Bollen,1989,&lt;ref&gt;Bollen, KA. (1989). Structural Equations with Latent Variables. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Loehlin, 1992&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Loehlin, J. E. (1992). Latent Variable Models: An Introduction to Factor, Path, and Structural Analysis (2nd ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;).
R package ‘sem’, ‘lavaan’ are useful for the same.

==Experimental Design==
{{Main article|Experimental Psychology}}

Experimental Methods are very popular in psychology. It has more than 100 years tradition. Experimental psychology has a status of sub-discipline in psychology .
The statistical methods are applied for designing and analyzing experimental data. They involve, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA,  MANOVA, MANCOVA, binomial test, chi-square etc. are used for the analysis of the experimental data.

==Multivariate Behavioral Research==
Multivariate behavioral research is becoming very popular in psychology. These methods include Multiple Regression and Prediction; Moderated and Mediated Regression Analysis; Logistics Regression; Canonical Correlations; Cluster analysis; Multi-level modeling; Survival-Failure analysis; Structural Equations Modeling; hierarchical linear modelling etc. are very useful for psychological statistics (Hayes, 2013;&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, A. F. (2013). Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis. The Guilford Press: NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Agresti, 1990;&lt;ref&gt;Agresti, A. (1990). Categorical data analysis. Wiley: NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Loehlin, 1992;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Menard, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Menard, S. (2001). Applied logistic regression analysis. (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks. CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tabachnick, &amp; Fidell, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Tabachnick, B. G., &amp; Fidell, L. S. (2007). Using Multivariate Statistics, 5th ed. Boston: Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Journals for statistical application for psychology==
There are many specialized journals that publish advances in statistical analysis for psychology. Psychometrika is at the forefront. Educational and Psychological Measurement, Assessment, American Journal of Evaluation, Applied Psychological Measurement, Behavior Research Methods, British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, Multivariate Behavioral Research, Psychological Assessment, Structural Equation Modeling are other useful journals.

==Software Packages for Psychological Research==

Various software packages are available for statistical methods for psychological research. They can be classified as commercial software (e.g., [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]] and SPSS) and Open-Source (e.g., R). Among the free-wares, the R software is most popular one. There are many online references for R and specialised books on R for Psychologist are also being written (e.g., Belhekar, 2016 &lt;ref&gt;Belhekar, V. M. (2016). Statistics for Psychology Using R, New Delhi: SAGE. {{ISBN|9789385985003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The "psych" package of R is very useful for psychologists. Among others, "lavaan", "sem", "ltm", "ggplot2" are some of the popular packages. PSPP and KNIME are other free packages. Among the commercial packages include JMP, SPSS and SAS. JMP and SPSS are commonly reported in books.

{{coord|13|43|56.34|N|100|31|57.72|E|type:landmark_region:TH|display=title}}

The '''Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute''' (QSMI) ({{lang-th|สถานเสาวภา}} ''Sathan Saovabha'') in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], is a [[institute]] that specialises in the [[husbandry]] of venomous [[snakes]], the extraction and [[research]] of [[snake venom]], and vaccines, especially [[rabies vaccine]]. It houses the '''[[snake farm]]''', a popular tourist attraction.

The origins of the institute can be traced back to 1912 when [[Vajiravudh|King Rama VI]] granted permission for a government institute to manufacture and distribute [[rabies]] vaccine at the suggestion of [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Prince Damrong]], whose daughter, [[:th:หม่อมเจ้าบันลุศิริศานต์ ดิศกุล|Princess Banlusirisarn]], died from rabies infection. It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the ''Pastura Institute'' after [[Louis Pasteur]], who discovered the first vaccine against rabies. In 1917 it was renamed the ''Pasteur Institute'' and placed under the supervision of the [[Thai Red Cross Society]]. The institute also produced vaccine against [[smallpox]]. The Travel and Immunization Clinic is now located here. If offers vaccines and pre-travel consultation. 

In the early-1920s the king offered his private property for the construction of a new home for the institute on Rama IV Road. The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]]. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture [[antivenom]] for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by [[Savang Vadhana|Queen Savang Vadhana]], then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.

Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an [[antidote]] that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life.

The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the [[king cobra]] and all sorts of [[Viperidae|viper]]s. Visitors can see handlers interact with [[Pythonidae|python]]s, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given.

The QSMI and the snake farm are near [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]], on the corner of [[Henri Dunant Road]] and Rama IV Road.

On Christmas Day 1950, four Scottish students from the [[University of Glasgow]] ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart) removed the [[Stone of Scone]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]] and took the Stone back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1457731/Gavin-Vernon.html |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/defining-our-destiny-1-519098 |title=Defining our destiny |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were members of the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a group that supported [[Scottish Home Rule|home rule]] for Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In 2008 the incident was made into a film called ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-review-stone-of-destiny-1-1438029 |title=Film review: Stone of Destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Stone of Scone, the ancient Stone upon which Scottish monarchs had been crowned, was taken from [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland by King [[Edward I of England]] (Longshanks) in 1296 during the struggles against English invasion, which historians call the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] as a [[looting|spoil of war]], kept in Westminster Abbey in London and fitted into [[King Edward's Chair]].&lt;ref name="destiny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/highlights-stone-of-destiny |title=Stone of Destiny |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |year=2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent [[England|English]] and then [[United Kingdom|British]] monarchs were crowned sitting upon the chair and Stone.&lt;ref name="destiny" /&gt;  At the time, the Stone was viewed as a symbol of Scottish nationhood; by removing the Stone to London, Edward I was declaring himself 'King of the Scots'.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In 1950, Ian Hamilton, a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], approached Gavin Vernon with a plan to remove the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in London and return it to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The plan was funded by a [[Glasgow]] businessman, Robert Gray, who was a councillor on the [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow Corporation]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/first-stone-raider-meets-his-final-destiny-1-519088 |title=First Stone raider meets his final destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon agreed to participate in the plan along with Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart who were also students in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  By removing the Stone the group hoped to promote their cause for Scottish [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] and to reawaken a sense of national identity amongst the Scottish people.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;

==Removal of the Stone of Scone==
In December 1950, a few days before Christmas, the four students from Glasgow drove to London in two [[Ford Anglia]]s, a journey which took them eighteen hours.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/gavin-vernon-engineer-who-helped-return-the-stone-of-destiny-to-scotland-1.89326 |title=Gavin Vernon Engineer who helped return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On arrival in London they had a brief meeting at [[Lyons Corner House]] and decided to make an immediate attempt at removing the Stone from the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Later that day Ian Hamilton hid under a trolley in the Abbey, but was caught by a nightwatchman after the Abbey doors had been closed, briefly questioned, and then let go.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The following day Vernon and Stuart returned to Westminster Abbey and learned some information on the watchmen's shifts.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  In the middle of that night, the three men entered a works yard and gained entrance into [[Poet's Corner]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Reaching the Chapel containing the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[King Edward's Chair]], they pulled down the barrier.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On removing the Stone from under the Chair, it crashed to the floor and broke into two pieces&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The three men, using Hamilton's coat, dragged the larger piece down the high altar steps, then Hamilton took the smaller piece to one of the cars waiting outside.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Ian Hamilton placed the small piece of Stone in the boot of the car and got into the passenger seat.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he did this, Kay Matheson noticed a policeman in the gaslight; Hamilton and Matheson immediately fell into a lovers' clinch.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The policeman stopped and the three proceeded to have a conversation even though it was 5 A.M.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Having shared some jokes and a cigarette Matheson and Hamilton drove off to [[Victoria, London|Victoria]], Hamilton getting out on the way to walk back to the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

On his arrival there was no sign of Vernon and Stuart, so he proceeded to drag the large piece of stone to the car himself.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he was driving away he saw Vernon and Stuart walking towards him.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The stone was so heavy that the springs on the car were sagging, so Vernon, fearing the alarm had been raised, made his way to [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Hamilton and Stuart drove to [[Kent]], hid the large piece of stone in a field and made their way back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Matheson left her car, containing the small piece of the Stone, with a friend in the Midlands, and like Vernon made her way back to Scotland by train.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On discovering that the Stone was missing, the authorities closed the border between Scotland and England for the first time in four hundred years.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A fortnight later Hamilton and some friends – including John Josselyn, whose 21st great grandfather was, ironically, Edward I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/25017403/person/1650035497 | title=John Rodney Josselyn - Overview - Ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; – recovered the two pieces of stone and brought them to Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  They hired a stonemason, Baillie [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]], to mend the Stone.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  Gray placed a brass rod inside the Stone containing a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  To this day, nobody knows what was written on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In April 1951 the police received a tip-off and the Stone was found on the site of the High Altar at [[Arbroath Abbey]] where in 1320 the assertion of Scottish nationhood was made in the [[Declaration of Arbroath]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The Stone was returned to Westminster Abbey in February 1952.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

The police conducted an investigation with specific focus on Scotland.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  All four of the group were interviewed and all later confessed to their involvement with the exception of Ian Hamilton.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The authorities decided not to prosecute as the potential for the event to become politicised was far too great.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  [[Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], addressing Parliament on the matter, said: "The clandestine removal of the Stone from Westminster Abbey, and the manifest disregard for the sanctity of the abbey, were vulgar acts of vandalism which have caused great distress and offence both in England and Scotland.  I do not think, however, that the public interest required criminal proceedings to be taken."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/319077062/13B6B8FC20016577E13/1?accountid=15842 |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
To understand the implications of the raid, one must understand the political landscape in the United Kingdom just after the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Kingdom was a unified nation and even in an era of post-war austerity, devolution was not on the political agenda.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  At the time, the [[Scottish National Party]] had 0.7% of the vote, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had withdrawn its commitment to devolution, and the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Conservative Party]] was at the high point of its popularity in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The raid was completely unexpected and gave the cause of Scottish devolution and nationalism a brief sense of prominence in the public conscience throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

The students became notorious for the daring heist and in Scotland they achieved nigh-on hero status, while in contrast the English were somewhat bewildered.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The heist and the students became synonymous with the devolution and [[Scottish National Party|nationalist]] political movements in Scotland from 1950 onwards.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

Over time the incident encouraged a belief in change, throwing open to scrutiny the Union, which had existed since [[Acts of union 1707|1707]].&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;   Long before the Stone was officially returned to Scotland in 1996 and the Scottish people voted for devolution in 1997, the removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950 contributed to those events.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

== Portrayals in popular culture ==

The removal of the stone was the subject of a contemporary [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] song by Donald MacIntyre, "''[[Òran na Cloiche]]''" ("The Song of the Stone"). Its return to England was the subject of an accompanying [[lament]], "''Nuair a Chaidh a' Chlach a Thilleadh''" ("When the Stone Was Returned").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Somerled |date=1968 |title=Sporan Dhòmhnaill - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre, the Paisley Bard |trans-title=Donald's Purse - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre |url= |language=gd |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn= |page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hamilton's book, ''The Taking of the Stone of Destiny'', was made into a film entitled ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''. The film depicted Hamilton (played by [[Charlie Cox]]) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the [[Stone of Scone]]. Additionally, Hamilton had a small, [[cameo role]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037156/ Stone of Destiny]," ''[[The Internet Movie Database]]''. ''(Retrieved 2010-01-09.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Alba]] released an hourlong bilingual (Scottish Gaelic and English) dramatization of Kay Matheson's (played by [[Kathleen MacInnes]]) interrogation by the police. In this version Matheson pretends not to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJgudcRi64|title=AN CEASNACHADH - Interrogation of a Highland Lass|first=|last=Gaelic Filmz|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' the episode "The Stone of Scone" (1997) reveals the Stone of Destiny was swiped and duplicated by immortals: the Scotsman [[Duncan MacLeod]] and his friends [[Hugh Fitzcairn]] and [[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda Darieux]]. A cover story involving students was concocted to conceal their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/highlander/the-stone-of-scone-55212/|title=Highlander: The Stone of Scone|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">The '''Rossiter–McLaughlin effect''' is a [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] phenomenon observed when either an [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary's]] secondary star or an [[extrasolar planet]] is seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] across the face of the primary or parent star. As the main star rotates on its axis, one quadrant of its [[photosphere]] will be seen to be coming towards the viewer, and the other visible quadrant to be moving away. These motions produce [[blueshift]]s and [[redshift]]s, respectively, in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], usually observed as a broadening of the [[spectral line]]s. When the secondary star or planet transits the primary, it blocks part of the latter's disc, preventing some of the shifted light from reaching the observer. This causes the observed mean redshift of the primary star as a whole to vary from its normal value. As the transiting object moves across to the other side of the star's disc, the redshift anomaly will switch from being negative to being positive, or vice versa.  This effect has been used to show that as many as 25% of [[hot jupiter|hot Jupiters]] are orbiting in a retrograde direction with respect to their parent stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triaud |first=A. H. M.

[[Image:Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.svg|frame|center|Illustration showing the effect. The viewer is situated at the bottom. Light from the anticlockwise-rotating star is blue-shifted on the approaching side, and red-shifted on the receding side. As the planet passes in front of the star it sequentially blocks blue- and red-shifted light, causing the star's apparent radial velocity to change when it in fact does not.]]

== History ==
J. R. Holt in 1893 proposed a method to measure the [[stellar rotation]] of stars using [[radial velocity]] measurements, he predicted that when one star of an eclipsing binary eclipsed the other it would first cover the advancing blueshifted half and then the receding redshifted half. This motion would create a [[redshift]] of the eclipsed star’s spectrum followed by a [[blueshift]], thus appearing as a change in the radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsed star.&lt;ref name="Triaud2013"/&gt;

The effect is named after [[Richard Alfred Rossiter]] and [[Dean Benjamin McLaughlin]].

'''Sexual inversion''' is a term used by [[sexologist]]s, primarily in the late 19th and early 20th century, to refer to [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis]]'s definition was "sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex".  Ellis, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13611/13611-h/13611-h.htm#2_Page_1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual inversion was believed to be an inborn reversal of [[gender]] traits:  male inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally female pursuits and dress and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] described female sexual inversion as "the masculine soul, heaving in the female bosom".&lt;ref name="Taylor-288"&gt;Taylor, 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its emphasis on [[gender role]] reversal, the theory of sexual inversion resembles [[transgender]], which did not yet exist as a separate concept at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially confined to medical texts, the concept of sexual inversion was given wide currency by [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s 1928 [[lesbian fiction|lesbian novel]] ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', which was written in part to popularize the sexologists' views.  Published with a foreword by the sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], it consistently used the term "invert" to refer to its protagonist, who bore a strong resemblance to one of Krafft-Ebing's case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, 133; Taylor, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
According to this theory, [[gay men]] and [[lesbian]]s were sexual "inverts", people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the "opposite" [[anatomical sex]] (according to the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Therefore, same-gender desires and attraction were explained as "latent heterosexuality", and bisexual desire was known as ''psychosexual hermaphroditism'' – in other words, gay men and lesbians were really just [[heterosexual]]s who were "born in the wrong body", and "[[bisexual]]s" were what modern-day sexologists would call [[intersexual]]s (formerly ''[[hermaphrodite]]s'') by this theory (the bisexual person's "male" part supposedly has attractions towards females, and the "female" part have attractions towards males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|date=2 Jul 2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=9781580054751|pages=8-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT8|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory fails to explain though the attraction of a "male" part towards males.

[[File:Slow sand filter profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A profile of slow sand filter used in a water purification plant.]]

'''Slow sand filters''' are used in [[water purification]] for treating [[raw water]] to produce a [[potable]] product. They are typically 1 to 2 metres deep, can be rectangular or cylindrical in cross section and are used primarily to treat surface water. The length and breadth of the tanks are determined by the flow rate desired by the filters, which typically have a loading rate of 200 to 400 litres per hour per square metre (or 0.2 to 0.4 cubic metres per square metre per hour).

Slow sand filters differ from all other filters used to treat drinking water in that they work by using a complex biological film that grows naturally on the surface of the sand. The sand itself does not perform any filtration function but simply acts as a substrate, unlike its counterparts for UV and pressurized treatments. Although they are often  preferred technology in many developing countries because of their low energy requirements and robust performance, they are also used to treat water in some developed countries, such as the [[UK]], where they are used to treat water supplied to [[London]]. Slow sand filters now are also being tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.

== History ==

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]

The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. (2003). Crowded with genius: the Scottish enlightenment: Edinburgh's moment of the mind. New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Keith. (1998). The history of chlorine. Waterworld, 14 (8), 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]].

Water treatment came to the United States in 1872 when [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] opened the first slow sand filtration plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=George|title=PRESENT DAY WATER FILTRATION PRACTICE|journal=American Water Works Association|date=March 1914|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|jstor=41224153}}&lt;/ref&gt; dramatically reducing instances of cholera and typhoid fever which had been seriously impacting the local community. Poughkeepsie's design criteria were used throughout the country as a model for other municipalities. Poughkeepsie's original treatment facility operated continuously for 87 years before being replaced in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History {{!}} Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility|url=http://pokwater.com/history/|website=pokwater.com|publisher=Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

[[File:Slow sand filter room.jpg|thumb|The raw water is let in to the filter room slowly from the pipe on the right. The water will pass through the sand layers down to the bottom of this room. The Schmutzdecke layer can be observed in this picture.]]

Slow sand filters work through the formation of a gelatinous layer (or [[biofilm]]) called the [[hypogeal]] layer or ''[[Schmutzdecke]]'' in the top few millimetres of the fine sand layer.  The ''Schmutzdecke'' is formed in the first 10–20 days of operation&lt;ref name=cawst&gt;Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology, Biosand Filter Manual: Design, Construction, &amp; Installation," July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[protozoa]], [[rotifera]] and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As an epigeal biofilm ages, more algae tend to develop and larger aquatic organisms may be present including some [[bryozoa]], [[Mollusca|snails]] and [[Annelid]] worms. The surface biofilm is the layer that provides the effective purification in potable water treatment, the underlying sand providing the support medium for this biological treatment layer. As water passes through the hypogeal layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and soluble organic material is [[adsorbed]]. The contaminants are metabolised by the bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The water produced from an exemplary slow sand filter is of excellent quality with 90-99% bacterial cell count reduction.&lt;ref name=ndwc&gt;National Drinking Water Clearinghouse (U.S.), Morgantown, WV. [http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/DW/publications/ontap/tech_brief/TB15_SlowSand.pdf "Slow Sand Filtration."] Tech Brief Fourteen, June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow sand filters slowly lose their performance as the biofilm thickens and thereby reduces the rate of flow through the filter. Eventually, it is necessary to refurbish the filter. Two methods are commonly used to do this. In the first, the top few millimetres of fine sand is scraped off to expose a new layer of clean sand. Water is then decanted back into the filter and re-circulated for a few hours to allow a new biofilm to develop. The filter is then filled to full volume and brought back into service.&lt;ref name="ndwc" /&gt; The second method, sometimes called wet harrowing, involves lowering the water level to just above the hypogeal layer, stirring the sand; thus precipitating any solids held in that layer and allowing the remaining water to wash through the sand. The filter column is then filled to full capacity and brought back into service. Wet harrowing can allow the filter to be brought back into service more quickly.&lt;ref name="cawst" /&gt;

== Features ==

[[File:Slow sand filter EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Typical configuration of a housed slow sand filter system]]

[[File:Vsakovací nádrže umělé infiltrace v ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|[[Artificial infiltration]] works on the principles of slow sand filters]]

Slow [[sand filter]]s have a number of unique qualities:

# Unlike other filtration methods, slow sand filters use biological processes to clean the water, and are non-pressurized systems. Slow sand filters do not require chemicals or electricity to operate.
# Cleaning is traditionally done by use of a mechanical scraper, which is usually driven into the filter bed once the bed has been dried out. However, some slow sand filter operators use a method called "wet harrowing", where the sand is scraped while still under water, and the water used for cleaning is drained to waste.
# For municipal systems there usually is a certain degree of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], since it is desirable for the maximum required throughput of water to be achievable with one or more beds out of service.
# Slow sand filters require relatively low [[turbidity]] levels to operate efficiently. In summer conditions with high microbial activity and in conditions when the [[raw water]] is turbid, blinding of the filters due to [[bioclogging]] occurs more quickly and pre-treatment is recommended.
# Unlike other water filtration technologies that produce water on demand, slow sand filters produce water at a slow, constant flow rate and are usually used in conjunction with a storage tank for peak usage. This slow rate is necessary for healthy development of the biological processes in the filter.&lt;ref name="EPA1990"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(1990). Cincinnati, OH. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=300048WU.txt "Technologies for Upgrading Existing or Designing New Drinking Water Treatment Facilities."] Document no. EPA/625/4-89/023.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–41}}&lt;ref name="HDR"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Public Water Systems |last=HDR Engineering |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-29211-1 |page=353 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieg7lvujyt0C&amp; |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many municipal [[water treatment]] works will have 12 or more beds in use at any one time, smaller communities or households may only have one or two filter beds.

In the base of each bed is a series of [[Brickwork#Herringbone bond|herringbone]] drains that are covered with a layer of pebbles which in turn is covered with coarse gravel. Further layers of sand are placed on top followed by a thick layer of fine sand. The whole depth of filter material may be more than 1 metre in depth, the majority of which will be fine sand material. On top of the sand bed sits a supernatant layer of unpurified water.

== Advantages ==

* As they require little or no mechanical power, chemicals or replaceable parts, and they require minimal operator training and only periodic maintenance, they are often an [[appropriate technology]] for poor and isolated areas.
* Slow sand filters, due to their simple design, may be created [[DIY]]. DIY-slow sand filters have been used in Afghanistan and other countries to aid the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.tearfund.org/en/resources/publications/footsteps/footsteps_31-40/footsteps_35/the_household_slow_sand_filter/ DIY slow sand filter]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slow sand filters are recognized by the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf/en/|title=WHO - Slow sand filtration|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406214600/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf/en/|archivedate=6 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxfam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.pdf|title=UNHCR eCentre|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316064200/http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.PDF|archivedate=16 March 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/regs/swtrsms.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as being superior technology for the treatment of surface water sources. According to the World Health Organization, "Under suitable circumstances, slow sand filtration may be not only the cheapest and simplest but also the most efficient method of water treatment."

* Due to the low filtration rate, slow sand filters require extensive land area for a large municipal system.&lt;ref name="EPA1990" /&gt; Many municipal systems in the U.S. initially used slow sand filters, but as cities have grown they subsequently installed [[rapid sand filter]]s, due to increased demand for drinking water.

'''Sociology of language''' is the study of the relations between [[language]] and [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman |first=Joshua A. |year=1972 |title=The sociology of language: An interdisciplinary social science approach to language in society |publisher=Newbury House |isbn=978-0-912066-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the field of [[sociolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mesthrie |first=Rajend |year=2007 |chapter=Sociolinguistics and sociology of language |editor1=Bernard Spolsky |editor2=Francis M. Hult |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |isbn=9781405154109 |doi= 10.1111/b.9781405154109.2007.00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the effect of society on language. One of its longest and most prolific proponents was [[Joshua Fishman]], who among other major contributions, was founding editor of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]''. Sociology of language studies society in relation to language whereas Sociolinguistics studies language in relation to society. For the former, society is the object of study, whereas, for the latter, language is the object of study. The basic idea is that language reflects, among several other things, attitudes that speakers want to exchange or that just get reflected through language use. These attitudes of the speakers is the sociologist's information.

A sociology of language would seek to understand the way that social dynamics are affected by individual and group language use. According to Su-Chiao Chen language is considered to be a social value within this field, which researches social groups for phenomena like [[multilingualism]] and Lingual conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Su-Chiao|editor=Nancy Hornberger and David Corson|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education: Research Methods in Language and Education|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-011-4535-0|pages=1–14|chapter=Sociology of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have to do with who is 'authorized' to use what language, with whom and under what conditions. It would have to do with how an individual or group identity is established by the language that they have available for them to use. It would seek to understand individual expression, one's (libidinal) investment in the linguistic tools that one has access to in order to bring oneself to other people.

== History and origins ==
Sociology of language, particularly American sociolinguistics, was regarded to have been founded in the early 1960s, mainly by [[William Labov]], who developed much of the methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shuy|first=Roger W. |title=A Brief History of American Sociolinguistics 1949-1989 |journal=Historiographia Linguistica |volume=17 |issue=1-2 |year=1990|pages=183-209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound recognition''' is a technology, which is based on both traditional [[pattern recognition]] theories and audio signal analysis methods. Sound recognition technologies contains preliminary data processing, [[feature extraction]] and classification algorithms. Sound recognition can classify feature vectors, feature vectors are created as a result of preliminary data processing and [[linear predictive coding]]. 

Sound recognition technologies are used for:
* [[Music recognition]]
* [[Speech recognition]]
* the automatic alarm detection an identification for surveillance, monitoring systems, based on the acoustic environment
* the assistance to disabled or elderly people affected in their hearing capabilities
* [[species identification|identifying species]] of fish and mammals in [[acoustical oceanography]]
* smart safety solutions
In monitoring and security solutions, an important contribution to alarm detection and alarm verification can be supplied, using sound recognition techniques. In particular, these methods could be helpful for intrusion detection in places like offices, stores, private homes or for the supervision of public premises exposed to person aggression. In all these cases, a recognition system can report about a danger or distress event. It could further identify sounds like glass break, doorbells, smoke detector alarms, red alerts, human screams, baby cries and others. Sometimes, the alarm is triggered by other of detectors (e.g. temperature or video-based) and the sound recognizer would be associated to these other modalities, to verify the alarm, with the purpose of decreasing the global false alarm detection rate.

Solutions based on a sound recognition technology can offer assistance to disabled and elderly people affected in hearing capabilities, helping them to keep or recover some independence in their daily occupations.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7129872/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only several companies who are working on the Sound recognition technology: AbiliSense (checking sounds of the home and city environment), OtoSense (checking sounds of engines) and [https://www.audioanalytic.com/ Audio Analytic] (AI company who's "Embedded sound recognition AI software gives consumer technology, such as smart speakers, hearables, smart home tech, mobile phones and automotive, a sense of hearing." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.audioanalytic.com/|title=Audio Analytic - enabling intelligent products through sound recognition|website=Audio Analytic|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; has sound recognition software that makes consumer products more intelligent).

{{Disability}}

In the United States, '''special needs''' is a term used in clinical diagnostic and functional development to describe individuals who require assistance for disabilities that may be medical, mental, or psychological. For instance, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] and the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]] 9th edition both give guidelines for clinical diagnosis. Special needs can range from people with [[autism]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[down syndrome]], [[dyslexia]], [[blindness]], [[ADHD]], and [[cystic fibrosis]]. They can also include cleft lips and/or palates, port-wine stains, and missing limbs. The types of special needs vary in severity, and a student with a special need is classified as being a severe case when the students IQ is between 20 and 35. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sess.ie/categories/general-learning-disabilities/severeprofound-general-learning-disability|title=Severe/Profound General Learning Disability}}&lt;/ref&gt; These students typically need assistance in school, and have different services given to them for them to succeed in a different setting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/severe-disabilities-definition-examples.html|title=Severe Disabilities: Definition &amp; Examples}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United Kingdom, special needs often refers to special needs within an educational context. This is also referred to as '''special educational needs''' (SEN).   In the United States, 18.5 percent of all children under the age of 18 (over 13.5 million children) had special health care needs as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17290559|year=2005|last1=Tu|first1=HT|last2=Cunningham|first2=PJ|title=Public coverage provides vital safety net for children with special health care needs|issue=98|pages=1–7|journal=Issue brief (Center for Studying Health System Change)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More narrowly, it is a legal term applying in [[foster care]] in the [[United States]], derived from the language in the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] of 1997. It is a diagnosis used to classify [[child]]ren as needing "more" services than those children without special needs who are in the foster care system. It is a diagnosis based on [[behavior]], childhood and [[family history]], and is usually made by a [[health care]] professional.

== U.S. special needs adoption statistics ==

In the [[United States]], more than 150,000 children with special needs are waiting for permanent homes. Traditionally, children with special needs have been considered harder to place for [[adoption]] than other children, but experience has shown that many children with special needs can be placed successfully with families who want them. The [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] of 1997 (P.L. 105-89) has focused more attention on finding homes for children with special needs and making sure they receive the post-adoption services they need. Pre-adoption services are also of critical importance to ensure that adoptive parents are well prepared and equipped with the necessary resources for a successful adoption. The [[United States Congress]] enacted the law to ensure that children in foster care who cannot be reunited with their birth parents are freed for adoption and placed with permanent families as quickly as possible.

The disruption rate for special needs adoption is found to be somewhere between ten and sixteen percent. A 1989 study performed by Richard Barth and Marianne Berry found that of the adoptive parents that disrupted, 86% said they would likely or definitely adopt again. 50% said that they would adopt the same child, given a greater awareness of what the adoption of special needs children requires.&lt;ref name="barth"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2000.00447.x|title=Building Effective Post-Adoption Services: What is the Empirical Foundation?|year=2000|last1=Barth|first1=Richard P.|last2=Miller|first2=Julie M.|journal=Family Relations|volume=49|issue=4|pages=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within disrupted special needs adoption cases, parents often said that they were not aware of the child's history or the severity of the child's issues before the adoption.&lt;ref name="barth"/&gt; There is also more care that goes into it when a child of special needs is in the process of getting adopted. Because of the [[Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 P.L. 96-272]], the child's needs have to be met within the home before allowing adoption, including being able to financially support the child. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Families for Waiting Kids: The Challenge of Special Needs Adoption in the 90’s and Beyond|url=https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/hdfs/fii/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pf_fis42report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Special Needs is a short form of Special Education Needs&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050928185145/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11895&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specialchildren.about.com/od/gettingadiagnosis/p/whatare.htm|title=What It Means When a Child Has "Special Needs"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a way to refer to students with disabilities, in which their learning may be altered or delayed compared to other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are special educational needs?|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/what-are-special-educational-needs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Special Needs in the education setting comes into play whenever a child's education program is officially altered from what would normally be provided to students through an Individual Education Plan which is sometimes referred to as an Individual Program plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/specialed/iepssn/whyiep.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409224002/http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/specialed/iepssn/whyiep.htm |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special Education aids to the students learning environment, to create a uniform system for all children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Education in the Schools|url=https://www.cec.sped.org/Policy-and-Advocacy/CEC-Professional-Policies/Special-Education-in-the-Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">In [[applied mathematics]], the two-dimensional '''Spectral [[signal-to-noise ratio]]''' (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency {{harv|Unser|1987}}. It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the [[Fourier shell correlation]]. The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in [[cryo-electron microscopy]].

== Calculation ==

:&lt;math&gt;
SSNR (r)
 = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R}\sum_{k_i}{ \left|{ F_{r_i,k} - \bar{F}_{r_i}}\right|^2}} -1
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
:&lt;math&gt;
 =
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in R}\left|\sum_{k_i}{ F_{r_i,k} }\right|^2}
{\displaystyle \frac{K}{K-1} \sum_{r_i \in R} 
\left| \sum_{k_i}F^2_{r_i,k} - \frac{1}{K}\left(\sum_{k_i}F_{r_i,k}\right)^2 \right|}
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_{r_i,k}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for image k for a pixel &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible convert the SSNR into an equivalent FRC using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
FRC = \frac{SSNR}{SSNR + 1}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26578">'''Thermal depolymerization''' ('''TDP''') is a [[depolymerization]] process using [[hydrous pyrolysis]] for the reduction of complex [[organic material]]s (usually [[waste]] products of various sorts, often [[biomass]] and [[plastic]]) into light [[crude oil]]. It mimics the natural [[geology|geological]] processes thought to be involved in the production of [[fossil fuel]]s. Under pressure and heat, long chain [[polymer]]s of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] decompose into short-chain [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s with a maximum length of around 18 [[carbon]]s.

==Similar processes==
Thermal depolymerisation is similar to other processes which use [[superheated water]] as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct [[Hydrothermal Liquefaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Biomass Program, direct Hydrothermal Liquefaction| work =| publisher =US Department of Energy.

These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as [[pyrolysis]]. The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other commercial scale processes include the "SlurryCarb" process operated by EnerTech, which uses similar technology to decarboxylate wet solid biowaste, which can then be physically dewatered and used as a solid fuel called E-Fuel. The plant in Rialto, California was designed to process 683 tons of waste per day.   However, it failed to perform to design standards and was closed down.  The Rialto facility defaulted on its bond payments and is in the process of being liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

Thermal depolymerization is similar to the geological processes that produced the fossil fuels used today, except that the technological process occurs in a timeframe measured in hours. Until recently, the [[human]]-designed processes were not efficient enough to serve as a practical source of fuel&amp;mdash;more [[energy]] was required than was produced.

The first industrial process to obtain gas, [[diesel fuel]]s and other petroleum products through pyrolysis of coal, tar or biomass was designed and patented in the late 1920s by [[Fischer-Tropsch]]. In U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=-MlwAAAAEBAJ 2,177,557], issued in 1939, Bergstrom and Cederquist discuss a method for obtaining oil from wood in which the wood is heated under pressure in water with a significant amount of [[calcium hydroxide]] added to the mixture. In the early 1970s Herbert R. Appell and coworkers worked with hydrous pyrolysis methods, as exemplified by U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=UEU9AAAAEBAJ 3,733,255] (issued in 1973), which discusses the production of oil from sewer [[sludge]] and municipal refuse by heating the material in water, under pressure, and in the presence of [[carbon monoxide]].

An approach that exceeded [[break-even]] was developed by [[Illinois]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Paul Baskis]] in the 1980s and refined over the next 15 years  (see U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=0LYmAAAAEBAJ 5,269,947], issued in 1993). The technology was finally developed for commercial use in 1996 by [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT). [[Brian S. Appel]] (CEO of CWT) took the technology in 2001 and expanded and changed it into what is now referred to as TCP (Thermal Conversion Process), and has applied for and obtained several patents (see, for example, published patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=KxbsAQAAEBAJ 8,003,833], issued August 23, 2011). A Thermal Depolymerization demonstration plant was completed in 1999 in [[Philadelphia]] by Thermal Depolymerization, LLC, and the first full-scale commercial plant was constructed in [[Carthage, Missouri]], about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from [[ConAgra Foods]]' massive [[Butterball]] turkey plant, where it is expected to process about 200 [[ton]]s of [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] waste into {{convert|500|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day.

==Theory and process==

In the method used by CWT, the water improves the heating process and contributes hydrogen to the reactions.

In the [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT) process,&lt;ref&gt;The description of the operation of the process, including temperatures, pressures, and time, has been adapted from the description in Brad Lemley (May 2003). [http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover. See also the description of the operation of the process in Appel et al., published U. S. patent application US [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VrGfAAAAEBAJ 2004/0192980], publication date September 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the feedstock material is first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water if it is especially dry. It is then fed into a [[pressure vessel]] reaction chamber where it is heated at [[isochoric process|constant volume]] to around 250 °[[Celsius|C]]. Similar to a [[pressure cooker]] (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 [[MPa]]) (near the point of [[Boiling point|saturated water]]). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: [[Flash evaporation]]). The result is a mix of crude hydrocarbons and solid [[mineral]]s. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by [[fractional distillation]], in a process similar to conventional [[oil refining]].

The CWT company claims that 15 to 20% of feedstock energy is used to provide energy for the plant. The remaining energy is available in the converted product. Working with turkey [[offal]] as the feedstock, the process proved to have yield efficiencies of approximately 85%; in other words, the energy contained in the end products of the process is 85% of the energy contained in the inputs to the process (most notably the energy content of the feedstock, but also including electricity for pumps and natural gas or [[woodgas]] for heating). If one considers the energy content of the feedstock to be free (i.e., waste material from some other process), then 85 units of energy are made available for every 15 units of energy consumed in process heat and electricity. This means the "[[EROEI|Energy Returned on Energy Invested]]" (EROEI) is (6.67), which is comparable to other energy harvesting processes. Higher efficiencies may be possible with drier and more carbon-rich feedstocks, such as waste [[plastic]].

By comparison, the current processes{{specify|date=July 2015}} used to produce [[alcohol as fuel|ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] from [[agriculture|agricultural]] sources have EROEI in the 4.2 range, when the energy used to produce the feedstocks is accounted for (in this case, usually [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s and the like). These EROEI values are not directly comparable, because these EROEI calculations include the energy cost to produce the feedstock, whereas the above EROEI calculation for thermal depolymerization process (TDP) does not.

The process breaks down almost all materials that are fed into it. TDP even efficiently breaks down many types of hazardous materials, such as [[poison]]s and difficult-to-destroy biological agents such as [[prion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Andrew A.|last2=Vogel|first2=Frédéric|last3=Lachance|first3=Russell P.|last4=Fröling|first4=Morgan|last5=Antal, Jr.|first5=Michael J.|last6=Tester|first6=Jefferson W.|title=Thermochemical biofuel production in hydrothermal media: A review of sub- and supercritical water technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=35|doi=10.1039/B810100K|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.3674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this.

===Carthage plant products===
As reported on 04/02/2006 by [[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]], a [[Carthage, Missouri]] plant was producing {{convert|500|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of oil made from 270 tons of turkey entrails and 20 tons of hog lard. This represents an oil yield of 22.3 percent. The Carthage plant produces API 40+, a high value crude oil. It contains light and heavy [[naphtha]]s, a [[kerosene]], and a [[gas oil]] fraction, with essentially no heavy fuel oils, tars, asphaltenes or waxes. It can be further refined to produce No. 2 and No. 4 [[fuel oil]]s.

The fixed carbon solids produced by the TDP process have multiple uses as a filter, a fuel source and a fertilizer. It can be used as activated carbon in [[wastewater]] treatment, as a fertilizer, or as a fuel similar to [[coal]].

==Advantages==
The process can break down organic poisons, due to breaking chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape needed for the poison's activity. It is likely to be highly effective at killing pathogens, including [[prion]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this. PrPSc does not break down by burning and I have not heard anything about high pressure and temperature (autoclaving does not work|date=September 2011}} It can also safely remove [[heavy metals]] from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.

Along with similar processes, it is a method of recycling the energy content of organic materials without first removing the water. It can produce liquid fuel, which separates from the water physically without need for drying. Other methods to recover energy often require pre-drying (e.g. [[burning]], [[pyrolysis]]) or produce gaseous products (e.g. [[anaerobic digestion]]).

==Potential sources of waste inputs==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that in 2006 there were 251 million tons of municipal solid [[waste]], or 4.6 pounds generated per day per person in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/facts.htm Municipal Solid Waste - Basic Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this mass is considered unsuitable for oil conversion.

==Limitations==
The process only breaks long molecular chains into shorter ones, so small molecules such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]] cannot be converted to oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that is an essential part of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power plant]], consisting of a [[gas turbine]] which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).

Another option is to sell the methane product as [[biogas]]. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]].

Many agricultural and animal wastes could be processed, but many of these are already used as [[fertilizer]], animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for [[paper mill]]s or as [[boiler]] fuel. [[Energy crop]]s constitute another potentially large feedstock for thermal depolymerization.

==Current status==
Reports in 2004 claimed that the Carthage facility was selling products at 10% below the price of equivalent oil, but its production costs were low enough that it produced a profit. At the time it was paying for turkey waste (see also below).

The plant then consumed 270 tons of turkey offal (the full output of the turkey processing plant) and 20 tons of egg production waste daily. In February 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Carthage plant was producing about {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil.

In April 2005 the plant was reported to be running at a loss. Further 2005 reports summarized some economic setbacks which the Carthage plant encountered since its planning stages. It was thought that concern over mad cow disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).

The above cost of production also excludes the operating cost of the thermal oxidizer and scrubber added in May 2005 in response to odor complaints (see below).

A biofuel tax credit of roughly $1 per US gallon (26 ¢/L) on production costs was not available because the oil produced did not meet the definition of "biodiesel" according to the relevant American tax legislation. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] specifically added thermal depolymerization to a $1 renewable diesel credit, which became effective at the end of 2005, allowing a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

===Company expansion===
The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-01-22-kantor_x.htm |title=Killing germs, reducing waste, making oil: TDP might be the next big thing |accessdate=2007-02-21 |last=Kantor |first=Andrew |date= 2004-01-23 |work=[[USA Today]] |quote=The City of Philadelphia currently turns a lot of its sewage sludge into landfill. (All together now: Eww.) But working with Changing World, the city is planning a TDP project to divert that sludge — and whatever pathogens are living in it — away from the land and into oil. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smell complaints===
The pilot plant in Carthage was temporarily shut down due to smell complaints. It was soon restarted when it was discovered that few of the odors were generated by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the Kansas City Star, April 12, 2005. The Kansas City Star website has since archived this article: [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_dispstring=(turkey-to-oil)%20AND%20date(2005) Kansas City: Search results]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plant agreed to install an enhanced thermal oxidizer and to upgrade its [[air scrubber]] system under a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.mo.gov/lawsuits/2005/050605rescarthage.pdf In the circuit court of Jasper country, Missouri, at Carthage]&lt;br /&gt; "The company said it has finished installation of a thermal oxidizer and upgraded odor scrubber system that were ordered as part of a consent agreement with the city and the Missouri attorney general's office." [http://www.joplinglobe.com/story.php?story_id=188739&amp;c=87 City questions RES]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plant is located only four blocks from the tourist-attracting town center, this has strained relations with the mayor and citizens of Carthage.

According to a company spokeswoman, the plant has received complaints even on days when it is not operating. She also contended that the odors may not have been produced by their facility, which is located near several other agricultural processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;"A plant spokeswoman, Julie Gelfand, tells the Pitch that repeated odor complaints have been lodged on days when the plant wasn't in operation or when wind conditions were inconsistent with the complaints." [http://www.pitch.com/Issues/2005-11-24/news/feature_4.html Fowl &amp; Crude]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2005, the plant was ordered by the state governor to shut down once again over allegations of foul odors as reported by MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;"A foul-smelling plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil was ordered closed by the governor Wednesday until the company finds a way to clear the air." [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10636943 Turkey-oil plant closed due to foul odors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 7, 2006, the plant has begun limited test runs to validate it has resolved the odor issue.&lt;ref&gt;"An experimental plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil can resume normal operations for 15 days to test whether new equipment solves a problem with bad smells that prompted the state to shut it down in December. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/14040813.htm Kansascity.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 24, 2006, the last lawsuit connected with the odor issue has been dismissed and the problem is acknowledged as fixed.&lt;ref&gt;"The last lawsuit left from a dispute over odors from a plant that converts turkey waste into fuel oil was dismissed Thursday after the facility fixed its odor problems."
[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/business/15352930.htm Last lawsuit dropped in Carthage turkey plant odor case]&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, however, another complaint was filed over bad smells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belleville.com/mld/belleville/news/state/16029275.htm Belleville.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This complaint was closed on January 11 of 2007 with no fines assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/newsrel/nr07_012.htm News Release 012 - MoDNR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status as of February 2009===
A May 2003 article in Discover magazine stated, "Appel has lined up federal grant money to help build demonstration plants to process chicken offal and manure in Alabama and crop residuals and grease in Nevada. Also in the works are plants to process turkey waste and manure in Colorado and pork and cheese waste in Italy. He says the first generation of depolymerization centers will be up and running in 2005. By then it should be clear whether the technology is as miraculous as its backers claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of August 2008, the only operational plant listed at the company's website is the initial one in Carthage, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingworldtech.com/where/index.asp Changingworldtech.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing World Technology applied for an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] on August 12; 2008, hoping to raise $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10017027-54.html?tag=nefd.top News.Cnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual [[Dutch Auction]] type IPO failed possibly because CWT has lost nearly $20 million with very little revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth2tech.com/2009/02/13/changing-world-ipo-is-a-no-go/ Earth2tech.com], changing world IPO is a no go&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN0130987720090201 UK.reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWT, the parent company of Renewable Energy Solutions, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. No details on plans for the Carthage plant have been released.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, Birkhäuser (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonti|first1=Enzo|title=The Reason for Analogies in Physics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtOy8xKN-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of "integral variables".

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term "space elements" we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term "time elements" we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a [[mechanical equilibrium]] to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t),  in order to conceive the "+" and "-" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as "sinks".

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb|'''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb|'''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.
