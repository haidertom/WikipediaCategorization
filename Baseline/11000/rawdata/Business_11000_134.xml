'''Alecu Beldiman''', common rendition of '''Alexandru Beldiman''' ([[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]]: AлєѯaндрȢ Бєлдимaн), also known as '''Alecul''' or '''Aleco Beldiman''' (1760–ca. January 1826), was a [[Moldavia]]n statesman, translator and poet, one of the forerunners of [[Romanian nationalism]]. A scion of the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar elite]], he was the eldest son of ''[[Vornic]]'' Gheorghe Beldiman, and the nephew-in-law of chronicler [[Enache Kogălniceanu]]. Alecu himself held high commission in the [[Moldavian military forces]] and bureaucracy, but secretly resented the [[Phanariote]] regime which had awarded them. He may have affiliated with a loose group known as the "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", championing an alliance between Moldavia's independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and support for the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

Beldiman's earliest contributions to cultural life probably date back to the 1790s, and originally included translations of French prose and [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]]. He may have contributed an original play, while his brother, Dumitrache Beldiman, helped arrange some of the earliest Moldavian stage performances, as puppet shows. By 1820, Alecu had become the most productive translator in Moldavia, directly contributing to [[Westernization]] and the spread of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]], and also completing a Romanian version of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. His works in the field were circulated in print form by [[Zaharia Carcalechi]], or otherwise copied by hand.

Beldiman's [[anti-Greek sentiment]] peaked during the 1821, when an invasion by the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]] chased him and other Romanian boyars out of Moldavia. The invasion and its violent aftermath inspired him to write the [[epic poem]] ''Tragodiea Moldovei'' ("Moldavia's Tragedy"). Although politically significant and comprising picturesque detail, the work was widely dismissed as a sample of exceptionally bad writing. Upon returning home, Beldiman also came into conflict with [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Ioan Sturdza]], who had him imprisoned at [[Tazlău Monastery]] in 1824. Poems he wrote during that interval show him as a conservative critic of republican and nationalist propaganda, and display his pity for the lower classes; he was also becoming more supportive of rule by the Ottoman Empire. Though eventually released, he maintained a low profile for the remainder of his life. His family continued to have a role in Moldavian, and later Romanian politics; his grandson [[Alexandru Beldiman]] was a journalist.

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
According to family tradition, Beldiman's ancestors crossed into Moldavia from the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Laurențiu Ungureanu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180309165937/https://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/serial-boieri-mari-episodul-6-alecubeldiman-omul-ne-a-adus-adevarul-1_58a822785ab6550cb8954dbb/index.html "Boieri mari, episodul 6: Alecu Beldiman, omul care ne-a adus ''Adevărul''], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', February 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 25; Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; This would make them distant relatives of the Hungarian Counts of Beldi.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; The immigrants entered historical record in March 1579, when "a certain Beldiman" served as Mayor (''[[Schultheiß|Șoltuz]]'') of [[Suceava]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 349. See also Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1609, [[Nichifor Beldiman]], recorded in some genealogies as a ''nemeș'' (untitled landowner), became ''[[Vornic]]''. He later served as [[Hetman]] and [[Logothete]],&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; and, in late 1615, led the boyars into rebellion against Prince [[Ștefan IX Tomșa]]. He was captured in neighboring [[Wallachia]] and beheaded, his remains being disposed of in the [[Siret River]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 349–350, 353. See also Bacalov, pp. 88–89; Călinescu, p. 55; Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; His two sons continued to hold major boyar ranks, while his daughter married into the Prăjescu family.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 350, 428&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, the family lost its economic prosperity and political influence, and came to be regarded as emancipated peasants, rather than as boyars. Isolated in the rural areas of [[Fălciu County]], they were often known by the nickname ''Mânja''.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu Beldiman's grandfather, Grigore Mânja Beldiman, rectified the situation. From beginnings as a [[Page (servant)|page]] at the court of Prince [[Constantin Cantemir]], he became fluent in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in [[Istanbul]], where he also befriended ''[[Begzada|Beizadea]]'' [[Dimitrie Cantemir]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; In 1711, following the [[Pruth River Campaign]], the Cantemirs were chased out of the country; a Beldiman branch also left Moldavia and settled in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

These events led to the emergence of a [[Phanariote]] regime in Moldavia and Wallachia: from ca. 1711, both [[Danubian Principalities]] had lost much of their autonomy within the [[Ottoman Empire]]; the boyar elite, formed mainly by [[Greeks in Romania|Greek immigrants]], controlled the administration. Grigore Mânja survived this time of troubles, and emerged as a favorite of the early Phanariotes: [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] and [[Grigore II Ghica]] both made used of his services. However, his participation in boyar conspiracies during the third reign of [[Mihai Racoviță]] endangered his career and his life.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's father was Gheorghe Beldiman (1724–1792). Orphaned of both parents by 1735, he and his four brothers were virtually adopted by the returning Prince Ghica, who groomed them for high office.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 295–297&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghe amassed a personal fortune while climbing through the ranks, serving as ''[[Stolnic]]'' in 1763, ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' in 1773, and finally ''Vornic'' in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of the 1770s]], he declared his personal submission to [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion Constantin, Ion Negrei, Gheorghe Negru, ''Ioan Pelivan: istoric al mișcării naționale din Basarabia'', p. 64. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2012.  {{ISBN|978-606-8337-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a noted figure in the [[Russophilia|Russophile]] party, and as a result earned a permanent appointment to the [[Sfatul boieresc|Moldavian Divan]] in 1774.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; 

His son's birth came during the final stages of the Phanariote era. Alecu was born in 1760, either in [[Iași]], the Moldavian capital, or in the smaller town of [[Huși]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal family was Greek.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; His mother, Maria, was the daughter of "publican Lefter" from Istanbul; her sister was married to [[Enache Kogălniceanu]], the Moldavian chronicler and social reformer.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 298. See also Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had an older daughter, Anastasia, and three younger sons: Iancu, Filip, and Dumitrache.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 291, 298–300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beldiman family coat of arms.svg|thumb|230px|Beldiman coat of arms]]
Early on, Alecu became fluent in Greek and more unusually for his generation, also in French.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Eliade, p. 335; Marcu, pp. 121, 123&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home and in private Greek schools—unlike Dumitrache, who was a graduate of the [[Princely Academy of Iași|Princely Academy]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; He climbed steadily through the boyar hierarchy, becoming ''[[Çavuş|Ceauș]]'' in the [[Moldavian military forces]] in 1785; he was ''[[Sardar|Serdar]]'' in 1789. At age 34, Alecu became a ''[[Paharnic]]'' at the princely court of [[Michael Drakos Soutzos]], before being moved to serve as ''[[Ispravnic]]'' in [[Neamț County]]. In 1800, under Prince [[Constantine Ypsilantis]], Beldiman was appointed ''[[Burgrave|Pârcălab]]'' of [[Galați]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"&gt;Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Following his father's death, he became sole owner of several estates. One was [[Miroslava, Iași|Cornești]], outside Iași; two others, Iezereni and Tețcureni, were in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 301–304. See also Iorga (1912), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman was married three times. His first wife, name unknown, was a member of the Romano clan; the second was Ileana, sister of the Logothete and poet [[Costache Conachi]], making him in-laws with [[Nicolae Vogoride]], future ''[[Kaymakam]]'' of Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 85, 980. See also Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman's final, childless, marriage was to Elena Greceanu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Nicolae N. Condeescu pushes the beginnings of Beldiman's literary activity into the 18th century, citing him as the uncredited translator of [[Vincent Voiture]]'s novel, ''Alcidales et Zelide''. In or around 1799, he also probably completed a version of [[Eustathios Makrembolites]] and [[Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps|Godard de Beauchamps]]' ''Story of Hysmine and Hysminias''.&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Beldiman became identified as one of the earliest contributors to the popularization of Western theater. The beginnings of Moldavian own theatrical activity are dated to ca. 1800, when Conachi, [[Nicolae Dimachi]] and Dumitrache Beldiman produced a short series of puppet shows, with Romanian-language texts.&lt;ref name="tvteatru"&gt;Tatiana Vișescu, "Începuturile teatrului românesc cult. Costachi Caragiali – ''O repetiție moldovenească sau noi și iar noi''", in ''Language and Literature – European Landmarks of Identity'', Vol. 1, 2005, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; They also wrote a comedy of their own, making Dumitrache's one of Moldavia's first playwrights.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Another play, tentatively dated to 1811, was called ''Serdarul din Orhei'' ("The ''Serdar'' of [[Orhei]]"); historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] believes that it was penned by Alecu Beldiman.&lt;ref name="tvteatru"/&gt;

Dumitrache and Alecu remained interested in both literature and politics; Filip withdrew to a monastery in 1792, while Iancu died later that same decade.&lt;ref name="Iacob, pp. 299–300"&gt;Iacob, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; According to philologist [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], Alecu Beldiman's next translation was from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (as ''Odiseia lui Omir''). Andreas Wolf, a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]] physician, met the Beldimans ca. 1797, praising them as lovers of arts and literature. Bogdan-Duică hypothesizes that Beldiman handed his manuscript to Wolf, who took it to [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] and promised to publish it there.&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the author's familiarity with, and reliance on, the French-style [[Romanization of Greek]], but is above all infused with staples of the [[Moldavian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, pp. 101–104&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar text, tentatively attributed to Beldiman, showed up at [[Dorohoi]], near Moldavia's border with the [[Duchy of Bukovina]].&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary fame===
An unclear tradition claims that one of the Belidimans was involved in a project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia as a single "republic", with help from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], "Cugetători români de acum o sută de ani. I. Trei conservatori în epoca de unire și consolidare", in ''Memoriile Secțiunii Istorice'', Vol. XXI, 1939, pp. 706–707&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russian invasion of Moldavia in 1806]], the youngest Beldiman brother interrupted his literary activities to serve in the occupation government.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Alecu's own literary output became more notable following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War]] and the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|peace of Bucharest]]. Both Alecu Beldiman and Conachi had been chased out of their Bessarabian estates by the Russian occupation, which ultimately annexed the region as a [[Bessarabian Governorate]]; they settled in Iași as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Prince [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] appointed Alecu an ''[[Agha (title)|Aga]]'' of his citadel in [[Hârlău]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"/&gt; At around that time, he also became involved in the thriving business of inn-keeping, establishing his own taproom in [[Bârlad]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Proca, "Hanuri. Istoria evoluției de la han la hotel", in ''Academia Bârlădeană'', Vol. XXI, Issue 4 (57), Winter 2014, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman was advanced to ''[[Postelnic]]'' in 1818, and finally became the ''Ispravnic'' of Iași in 1819, under Prince [[Michael Soutzos]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, p. 119. See also Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; An 1819 map by Giuseppe Bayardi shows that he owned a mansion on Iași's Sârbească Street.&lt;ref&gt;Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; His estate grew to include parts of [[Zorleni|Popeni]] and [[Vinderei]], in [[Tutova County]], as well as several other townhouses in Iași. He also owned several hamlets populated by [[Romani people in Romania|Romanies]], which he kept as [[Slavery in Romania|boyar slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ꙟгрoпaрѣ лȢй Aвєл, 1818.png|thumb|280px|[[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s burial, as illustrated in the 1818 edition of ''Moartea lui Avel'']]
At this new stage, Beldiman blended [[Romanian nationalism]] with an interest in modern education, declaring himself a direct contributor to the "material progress of the Romanian people".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Eliade, pp. 336, 348&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Neagu Djuvara]], Beldiman closely resembles the Wallachian intellectuals of his era, specifically [[Naum Râmniceanu]], [[Dionisie Eclesiarhul]], and [[Zilot Românul]], in being virulently anti-Greek and anti-Phanariote.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Pompiliu Eliade]] sees the Beldimans and the [[Sturdza family|Sturdzas]] as affiliates of the "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", which favored independence from the Ottomans and sought direct protection from the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 231–235, 248, 335&lt;/ref&gt; However, Iorga also highlights the limits of Beldiman's nationalism: although he opted to stay in "Turkish Moldavia", he "never wrote as much as a verse, as much as a single line of prose" against Russian occupation in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1912), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, scholar [[Ovid Densusianu]] reads Beldiman as a Moldavian particularist, who was generally indifferent to the tribulations of Romanians in Wallachia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Philologist Andreea Giorgiana Marcu notes that, as a translator of Western literature, Beldiman was necessarily a participant in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He resonated most with [[Neoclassicism]], and especially with its "obviously moralizing" accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, pp. 119, 121, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, culture critic [[George Panu]] proposes that Beldiman and Conachi must have been closely familiarized with, and imitators of, [[Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna]].&lt;ref&gt;Panu, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 years, Beldiman arguably became the most prolific among Moldavia's contributors to Westernizing translations.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 309–310; Marcu, pp. 119, 121&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Densusianu, Beldiman translated plays that were never intended for actual stage production, since there was no Moldavian theater to speak of.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; His texts had to introduce theatrical terminology for which there was yet no equivalent: he proposed ''obraz'' ("cheek" or "face") for "character", and ''schini'' for "scene".&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade proposes that Beldiman was directly inspired to write for the stage by witnessing Moldavia's first first-ever theatrical experiment, produced in December 1816 by [[Gheorghe Asachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1817, Beldiman had completed his own version of [[Voltaire]]'s ''Oreste'', which was only published in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Lascu, pp. 94–95; Eliade, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; He soon signed contracts with the Wallachian publisher, [[Zaharia Carcalechi]], who was active in the literary circles of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Habsburg Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, Beldiman also put out ''Învățătură sau povățuire pentru facerea pâinii'' ("A Guide or Advisor to Bread-making"), ultimately based on a text by Christian Albert Rückert, but directly translated from the Greek version penned by Dimitrios Samurkasis (Dimitrie Samurcaș).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Beldiman completed a translation of [[Salomon Gessner]]'s ''Der Tod Abels'', from the French intermediary. It was published at [[Buda]] as ''Moartea lui Avel''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Densusianu, p. 27; Lascu, p. 94; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman followed up in 1820 with ''Istoria lui Numa Pompilie''. This was a translation of [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]]'s ''Numa Pompilius'', though Beldiman suppressed any mention of the real author.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55. See also Densusianu, p. 27; Eliade, pp. 336, 354–355, 416; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Its preface includes some of the earliest Romanian views on [[Translation studies|traductology]]: Beldiman complained about his struggles in adapting [[History of the Romanian language|early modern Romanian]] to render complex phrases in French.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 354–355; Marcu, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by linguist [[Gheorghe Ivănescu]], Beldiman followed [[Iacob Stamati]] and other Moldavians in adopting a [[Wallachian dialect|Wallachian spelling]] for some of his core vocabulary. ''Istoria'' consistently used ''giudecată'' ({{IPA-ro|dʒudekatə}}; "trial" or "judgement") for the Moldavianized ''judecată'' ([ʒudekatə]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Ivănescu]], ''Probleme capitale ale vechii române literare'', pp. 62, 122. Iași: [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Editura Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], 2012.  {{ISBN|978-973-703-770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman completed numerous other translations, without ever submitting them for print. Various scribes copied them by hand, and they enjoyed popularity in boyar circles. However, Beldiman discovered that the texts were being slowly altered in the process, and decided to create his own authorized copies.&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 121"&gt;Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; This process involved several younger scribes. One was Ioniță Sion, who took dictation from Beldiman in writing "all sorts of verse and stories"; he was not paid for the job, but was allowed to make and keep his own copies.&lt;ref name="Lascu, p. 101"&gt;Lascu, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; By 1813, Matei Gane of [[Vadu Moldovei|Ciumulești]] had already collected and transcribed by hand Beldiman's various works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Gane]], ''Pe aripa vremei'', p. 72. Bucharest: Tipografia Steaua, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman penned, but never printed, other renditions of tragedies and stories by [[Antoine François Prévost]] (with ''[[Manon Lescaut]]''), [[Sophie Ristaud Cottin|Madame Cottin]], [[Pietro Metastasio]], [[René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt]], [[Jean-François Regnard]], [[Louis d'Ussieux]], and various unknown authors.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Cardaș, p. x; Marcu, pp. 119, 121–122. See also Densusianu, pp. 27–28; Djuvara, pp. 309–310; Eliade, pp. 416–417; Lascu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he also finished translated the ''[[Iliad]]'', but this work, if it ever existed, remains lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cardaș, p. x; Lascu, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tragodiea Moldovei''===
The final stage of Beldiman's literary and political career was marked by the [[Greek War of Independence]], part of which was fought on Moldavian soil. In early 1821, the country was invaded by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]' Greek forces, comprising the [[Filiki Eteria]] and the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]. This occupation forced Beldiman out of Moldavia, and back into Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="Densusianu, p. 27"&gt;Densusianu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The events, which culminated in an Ottoman incursion and a Greek defeat in the [[Battle of Dragashani]], were narrated by Beldiman in his rhyming chronicle. It is most often called ''Tragodiea Moldovei'' ("Moldavia's Tragedy"), but is also known as ''Eterie sau jalnicele scene prilejuite în Moldova din resvrătirile grecilor, prin șeful lor Alexandru Ipsilanti venitu din Rusia la anul 1821'' ("The Eteria or Awful Scenes Occurring in Moldavia Because of the Rebellions by Greeks under Their Leader Alexander Ypsilantis, Who Came in from Russia in 1821"). According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], the work was unintentionally "buffoonish", reading like a "humorous rigmarole".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result ran at 4,260 lines of verse which, Călinescu argues, was of an "old-fashioned type" and "monotonous", similar to later works by [[Constantin Negruzzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 54, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlexanderYpsilantisPruth.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Alexander Ypsilantis]] crossing the [[Prut River]] into Moldavia; allegory by [[Peter von Hess]]]]
Scholar [[Gheorghe Cardaș]] views Beldiman as the final Moldavian representative of a "prolix, untalented" school of poets, which began in 1681 with the anonymous ''Chronological Poem of the Moldavian Rulers''.&lt;ref&gt;Cardaș, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Densusianu notes that Beldiman demanded from his readers a patience that he never repaid. He was "not a poet, but only a versifier, and as such one in a string of mediocre writers." Moreover, his genre of choice, the "rhyming chronicle", was "unrewarding" and "manically" over-detailed, though he remained overall superior to Zilot, his Wallachian contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, ''Tragodiea'' is a "long and tedious newspaper article, prosaic as no prose has ever been, amusing only because the author himself realizes that his work is so very difficult, and his ability so very limited."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade also finds that, being no longer disciplined by foreign grammar (as he was in his translations), Beldiman constructs incoherent phrases. His vocabulary is "flooded" with Greek, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]], or [[Old Church Slavonic in Romania|Slavonic]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 355; Marcu, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Vlad Georgescu]], Beldiman was still notable as the most erudite chronicler of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; As Călinescu writes, an "entertaining jolt" in the epic came wherever Beldiman described his contempt for various of his contemporaries: the "godless dog" [[Vasileios Karavias]] and the haughty but "so very cowardly" [[Stefan Bogoridi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Complex descriptions remain rare, as Beldiman often dismisses the Eterists and his other adversaries with just one epithet, sometimes bordering on the obscene.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; One line refers to a "Lividi Nicolaki, that base and ugly soul", who, according to Beldiman, had been appointed commander of Moldavia's Romanies by Ypsilantis' government. Researchers are unsure about whether this is a reference to [[Niccolò Livaditti]], a [[Imperial Free City of Trieste|Triestene]] painter.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, Corina Cimpoeșu, Marcelina Brîndușa Munteanu, ''Niccolo Livaditi și epoca sa (1832–1858). Artă și istorie'', p. 21. Iași: [[Palace of Culture (Iași)|Palace of Culture]], 2012.  {{ISBN|978-606-93119-6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other aspects of the narrative were also polemical, reflecting Beldiman's brand of conservatism. In one episode of his epic, Beldiman sides with the [[Turks in Romania|local Turks]], whom the Eterist invasion had decimated.&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 34"&gt;Xenopol, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his stanzas lambasts [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], leader of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|parallel uprising in Wallachia]]. As noted by Călinescu, Beldiman and Vladimirescu were both Romanian nationalists, but of different visions; the Moldavian poet described the Wallachian revolutionist as "deceitful", prone to demagoguery.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 32. See also Georgescu, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[A. D. Xenopol]] also notes that Beldiman was sarcastic in his treatment of the Moldavian republican boyars, whom he called ''[[Decemviri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration of Ottoman rule was rendered complete by the [[Battle of Sculeni|Eterist defeat at Sculeni]] in June 1821. Beldiman, having been appointed ''Vornic'',&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; made the return trip to Iași. In November, he purchased the townhouse owned by a fellow boyar, the Wallachian [[Iordache Filipescu]], in Păcurari neighborhood; it was here that he finished writing ''Tragodiea''.&lt;ref name="Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26"&gt;Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; His poem-chronicle purposefully refrained from documenting the entirety of [[Ioan Sturdza]]'s reign, which began in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 54; Densusianu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; One stanza circulates the notion that Sturdza was a "son of Moldavia", rather than a Phanariote, and expresses his belief that a "golden century" would follow.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vornic'' soon returned to championing his version of boyar nationalism: in ''Tragodiea'', he makes explicit references to the "[[national interest]]".&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 169, 182–184, 187, 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; From 1823, Beldiman preserved a copy of what he claimed to be Moldavia's [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulation]] to the Ottomans, outlining the ancient rights of its inhabitants. The text expanded on earlier forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 186; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13–14, 19–22, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he was more pro-Ottoman than Zilot and other chroniclers, being above all thankful that the Empire had defeated Ypsilantis.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
In reality, Beldiman was at odds with the new regime. As one of the more conservative boyars, he clashed with the monarch. In March 1824, with Dimachi and others, he authored a letter of protest against Prince Sturdza, which was addressed to his overlord, [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]].&lt;ref&gt;Pungă, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, he was briefly imprisoned for his disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Confined inside [[Tazlău Monastery]], he produced his final set of poems, ''Stihuri'' ("Verse"). These are patriotic in tone, but noticeably skeptical of nationalism, explaining that, even though the Phanariotes had lost power, bad customs survived through native boyars; unusually in his context, he sided with the lower classes against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines refer to the harsh conditions faced by travelers, noting that rainstorms had rendered infernal his trip to Tazlău.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Ionescu, "Podurile în România", in ''Natura. Revistă pentru Răspândirea Științei'', Issue 4/1936, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, the ''Stihuri'' resemble both Neoclassicism and early [[Romantic poetry]], introducing elements later found in works by [[Barbu Paris Mumuleanu]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 120"&gt;Marcu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman was ultimately released and made a discreet return to politics, living in relative seclusion for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Densusianu, p. 27"/&gt; His last published translation came out in 1824. It was a first volume of [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]]'s ''Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark'', taken from a French version by [[Paul Henri Mallet]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 121"/&gt; He died in January 1826, or at, earliest, December 1825&lt;ref name="Iacob, p. 299"&gt;Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;—according to fellow writer Dimitrie Pastiescul, he still held a pen in his hand when this occurred.&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"/&gt; Buried at his family's favorite church of [[Talpalari Church|Talpalari]],&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Beldiman left a large number of manuscripts, which were reportedly sold by the pound to a local collector.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dumitrache and Filip survived their brother's death, the former dying in 1831.&lt;ref name="Iacob, pp. 299–300"/&gt; Filip, better known under his monastic name "Filaret", was appointed [[Archdiocese of Roman and Bacău|Bishop of Roman]] and carateker of the [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Metropolis]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; In 1842, he served as administrator of Moldavia, filling in for Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]].&lt;ref&gt;Pungă, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

From his Romano marriage, Alecu had a daughter. Known as either Pulheria or Profira, she married into the [[Cantacuzino family]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Djuvara, p. 355; Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; She was famous for raising her husband's illegitimate son, the half-Romani Dincă, who was formally her house slave. Her refusal to manumit him, and his subsequent suicide, resulted in mass support for abolitionism.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 276–278&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's son, Vasile Beldiman, married a [[Mavrocordatos family|Mavrocordatos]].&lt;ref name="ndi306"&gt;Narcis Dorin Ion, "Istorie și genealogie. Convorbiri cu domnul Mihai Dim. Sturdza", in ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 980; Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; His only notable public office was that of Caretaker (''Epitrop'') of Moldavian schools.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; His wife Elena sold the Beldiman house in Păcurari to boyar [[Lupu Balș]]; it changed hands and served various functions until being demolished in 1966.&lt;ref name="Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26"/&gt;

Vasile died in 1853,&lt;ref name="ndi306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iacob, p. 299"/&gt; and was survived by a son, [[Alexandru Beldiman]], who was the head of [[Romanian Police]] and close friend of the Principalities' first ''[[Domnitor]]'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. In this capacity, he failed to prevent Cuza's toppling in 1866, and came to oppose the regime of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], founding the left-wing newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]''.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Cornești, still owned by this branch of the family, was passed to poet [[Dimitrie Anghel]], and later to the Mavrocordatos.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

A Iordachi Beldiman, sometimes described as Alecu's son,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; was in fact one of his nephews, born to Dumitrache Beldiman.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Iordachi married Catinca Dimachi, daughter of the writer. She was made famous by her affair with poet [[Alexandru Hrisoverghi]]; according to one account, Hrisoverghi died after jumping out a window in Iordachi's townhouse.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 93, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; Also a ''Vornic'', Iordachi was noted for commissioning a gallery of portraits of Moldavian Princes.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, "Chipurile domnitorului Alexandru Moruzi în portrete din secolul XIX", in ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United Principalities]] era, he became a leading figure in Iași's conservative circles, helping [[Iacob Negruzzi]] establish the political review ''Constituțiunea''.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's niece, Maria or Marghioala, was a locally famous philanthropist,&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; married to politician [[Scarlat Miclescu]]. Their son, Dimitrie S. Miclescu (1820–1896), participated in the [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|1848 revolutionary movement]], as well as being a published poet. He became a noted agitator on the far-left of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]] and renounced all claim to boyar privilege, including his family name.&lt;ref&gt;"Dumitru Scarlat Miclescu", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 270/1896, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman's translations continued to be read by young intellectuals in all Romanian-speaking areas: [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]], who went abroad to study in 1828, ordered copies of ''Oreste'' and ''Istoria lui Numa Pompilie'', "so as not to forget his language".&lt;ref&gt;Laurențiu Vlad, "Câteva date despre educația unui tânăr boier valah. Studiile lui Constantin N. Brăiloiu la Sibiu, Geneva și Paris în anii 1822–1832", in ''Țara Bârsei'', Issue 8, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Ioniță Sion's manuscripts were preserved by his son, the poet-memoirist [[Gheorghe Sion]].&lt;ref name="Lascu, p. 101"/&gt; For decades, ''Tragodiea'' circulated in 23 handwritten copies, two of which were respectively owned by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and [[Alexandru Odobescu]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 120"/&gt; In the 1840s, [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] set himself the task of printing Beldiman's writings and documents as part of an anthology.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 177; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Eterie sau jalnicele scene'', ''Tragodiea'' was eventually printed in 1861, at the expense of an Alecu Balica; it was reissued in 1875 as ''Tragedia Moldovei''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 980. See also Densusianu, p. 29; Marcu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]] was actively campaigning for Beldiman to be included into the Romanian literary canon,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; while philologist [[Alexandru Lambrior]] unsuccessfully proposed to set the Romanian literary standard exclusively on words used by Beldiman and Conachi.&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman's work was finally rediscovered in the 1890s. One of its promoters was the antiquarian [[George Ionescu-Gion]], who insisted that Beldiman was without philosophical merit, but a genuine patriot.&lt;ref&gt;Rodica Florea, "Reviste și scriitori în ultimele două decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 945. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The same belief was expressed in 1910 by Xenopol, according to whom Beldiman was not significant as a poet, but voiced the "national sentiment in all its freedom".&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 34"/&gt;

'''Alexander Hamilton''' (before 1688 – after 1733) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Captain (naval)|sea captain]], [[privateer]] and [[merchant]].

==Biography==
In his early years he travelled widely through [[Europe]], the [[Barbary coast]], the [[West Indies]], [[British India|India]] and [[South-east Asia]]. On his arrival in [[Bombay]] in 1688 he was briefly pressed into the employ of the [[British East India Company]] in a local war, and then set up as a private country trader, operating from [[Surat]]. He was appointed commander of the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]] in June 1717, in which post he suppressed [[piracy]].

The main extant source of information on Hamilton is his own book, ''[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.503139 A New Account of the East Indies]'' (1727). The term then covered a much wider geographic area than it does today - 'most of the countries and islands of commerce and navigation, between the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and the island of [[Japan]].' Illustrated with lively anecdotes, it provides a valuable insight into life in early modern [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Ballantyne, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12042 ‘Hamilton, Alexander (b. before 1688, d. in or after 1733)’], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''António Augusto Serra Campos Dias da Cunha''' (born 1933 in [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]) is a Portuguese [[businessman]].

Established in Portugal since age nine, he always remained connected to [[Mozambique]], where he posteriorly established many businesses and gave support to social institutions. A [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in [[Law]] from the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Lisbon]], he practiced various sports while a college student, alternating between [[association football|football]], [[team handball|handball]] and [[basketball]]. In [[rugby football|rugby]] he went to participate in the national championship of the 1st division.

He associated with the [[Sporting CP]] at invitation of Emídio Pinheiro, a former President of the General Assembly. Still before the [[Carnation Revolution]] he became a friend of [[José Roquette]] and, later, went with him to the Direction of the SCP. In August 2000, he assumed the Presidency of the club and of the Patrimony Managing Society of Sporting as the 45th [[List of Sporting CP presidents|president]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sporting.pt/English/Club/club_presidents.asp&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding José Roquette, who had transformed the club into a Sport Anonymous Society. Under his presidency started at the end of 2001 the works of the new [[Estádio José Alvalade]] and Sporting was national champion in soccer in the season 2001/2002. During his tenure he became notorious for his complaints of "the fault is the system's" often when the club suffered defeats that were not directly caused by its own. He resigned in 2005 in solidarity with manager [[José Peseiro]] and was succeeded by [[Filipe Soares Franco]].

Although not affiliated with any political party, Dias da Cunha has appeared in many moments connected to the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], having publicly supported the presidential candidacies of [[Mário Soares]] and [[Jorge Sampaio]].

'''Camalia Valdés''' (born October 14, 1972), is the President and CEO of [[Cerveceria India]], Inc., Puerto Rico's largest brewery.

==Early years==
Valdés was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Her grandfather was [[Alfonso Valdés Cobián]], who in 1937, together with his brothers, Sabino and Ramón Valdés founded Cerveceria India, Inc. (Indian Brewery) in the City of [[Mayagüez]]. Her grandfather, who was the chairman and president of the company, was a successful leader whose leadership converted the company into Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery and manufacture of canned and bottled soft drinks.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/14/obituaries/alfonso-valdes-cobian-dies-in-san-juan-at-98.html New York Times; Published: February 14, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; When her grandfather died in 1988, her grandmother Grace Valdes over the company.

As a child she would often visit the company's manufacturing plant, where she would spend most of her time. In 1994, she earned a degree in liberal arts with a minor in legal studies from [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Valdés continued her legal studies in the [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico]] and in 1998, earned her [[Doctor of Laws|Juris Doctor]] degree.&lt;ref name="CVB"&gt;[http://www.cbonlinepr.com/puerto_rico/business_economy/40under40/forty_camalia_valdes.pdf Camalia Valdez - Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319000000/http://www.cbonlinepr.com/puerto_rico/business_economy/40under40/forty_camalia_valdes.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cerveceria India==

Valdés practiced law for a short time before joining the company in the position of manager of operations. She implemented new production methods and was responsible for improving the manufacturing plants infrastructure.

In 2002, Valdés was named president of the company. Under her leadership, "Malta India", a malt beverage, became most sold in Puerto Rico and the sales of Medalla Light, one of the company's beer brands, increased. The company, which is Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery, is also the manufacture of canned and bottled soft drinks.&lt;ref name="CVB"/&gt;

Valdés plans to increase her company's hold on the local marketplace and to successfully export the company's product overseas. She oversaw the investment of $24 million in the expansion of the company's manufacturing facilities with the aim of increasing manufacturing production by 60%. With the renovations, which were finished in 2008, Cerverceria India is amongst the most technically advanced breweries in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="CVB"/&gt;

==Political controversy==
In 2008, a newspaper investigation claimed that Valdés and "[[Coca-Cola]] de Puerto Rico" President Alberto de la Cruz were allegedly involved in a scheme which included illegal donations made by the [[Coca-Cola]] de Puerto Rico and Cervecería India to the political campaign of then [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]] [[Luis Fortuño]] who was running for [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to the accusations, Fortuño and his wife, Lucé Vela, reported having received $90,000 from SDA Global as income on their 2004 income taxes. The income was allegedly paid by both companies for legal services which Fortuño's wife never provided and instead were secretly funneled as donations. Valdés denied the allegations and nothing came of the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=20651&amp;ct_id=1 Caribbean Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Camalia Valdés lives in San Juan with her husband Craig T. Hylwa. According to an interview with Dennis Costa Pacheco, Valdés sponsors projects in education that promote innovation and new ways of thinking.&lt;ref name="CVB"/&gt; She is a sponsor of "El Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico" (The Art Museum of Puerto Rico)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapr.org/El-Museo/Patrocinio.aspx El Museo-Patrocinio], (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Y. Huang''' (born 1955)&lt;ref name="next"/&gt;, is a [[Taiwan]]ese businessman. From [[Taoyuan, Taiwan]], Huang received a master's degree in Business Administration from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. He was the chairman and the CEO of TSRC Corp. He used to be a senior consultant to CTCI Group, a consultant of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], an analyst of [[Exxon|Exxon International]], and the chairman of the [[Taiwan Sugar Corporation]]. He is the founder and now chairman of Taiwan Circular Economy Network.&lt;ref name="today"/&gt;

Huang is especially active in non-profit foundations. As a founder of Taiwan Circular Economy Network (TCEN), Huang is dedicated to promoting Taiwan's economic transition toward Circular Economy. As a founder of Association of Food Waste Compost Promotion, Huang champions Circular Agriculture by advocating a clean and safe environment by producing fertilizers and bio-energy from local waste. Huang was on the boards of New Frontier Foundation, a public policy think tank and Hao-Ran Foundation, a leading philanthropic institution dedicated to harnessing human rights, protecting environment, supporting development of sustainable farming.&lt;ref name="agri"/&gt;

==Promoting the circular economy==
Huang founded Taiwan Circular Economy Network (TCEN), a privately held foundation, in 2015 and has been the chairman since. In addition to promoting the concepts of circular economy, he continues to introduce new business models to Taiwan. Due to the limited natural resources, he expects to move the society from the linear business model to the circular business model, with aims to bring new economic values and increase the jobs and employments.&lt;ref name="agri"/&gt; On September 30, 2015, TCEN has signed an agreement with the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office (NTIO), to help transform Taiwan into a more competitive resource-efficient economy.&lt;ref name="agri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coop"/&gt;

Starting from February 7, 2018, Huang has a column on circular economy published bi-weekly in the weekly magazine ''Business Today'' (今周刊) to promote circular economy in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

==As chairman of Taiwan Sugar Corporation==
On September 10, 2016, Huang was appointed as the chairman of [[Taiwan Sugar Corporation]].&lt;ref name="msntw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taisugar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agri"/&gt;
As soon as Huang received the position of the chairman of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, he started to promote the establishment of the first modernized Don-Hai-Feng Pig Farm in Pingtung with biogass facility producing green energy by using the pig wastes co-digested with agricultural wastes as well as making the water recycle-used as a circular resource, with the goals of zero waste, zero pollution, and zero accident. The ground-breaking of this project is on February 8th of 2018. The pig farm will be installed with the cooling pads with negative pressure.&lt;ref name="focus"/&gt;

==Other activities==
While Huang was the executive board director of the Federal Transportation, he was elected as the chairman of the World Youth and Student Travel Conference (WYSTC) in 2008, a trade event for the global youth, student and educational travel industry conducted by the WYSE Travel Confederation and the organisations which merged to form WYSE.&lt;ref name="wystc"/&gt;

'''Computer-aided dispatch''' ('''CAD'''), also called '''computer-assisted dispatch''', is a method of dispatching [[taxicab]]s, [[courier]]s, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or [[emergency service]]s assisted by computer. It can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a [[mobile data terminal]] (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a [[two-way radio]]. Some systems communicate using a two-way radio system's [[selective calling]] features. CAD systems may send text messages with call-for-service details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless telephony text services like [[Short message service|SMS]]. The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched. CAD provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher has an opportunity to handle calls-for-service as efficiently as possible.

CAD typically consists of a suite of [[software]] packages used to initiate public safety calls for service, dispatch, and maintain the status of responding resources in the field. It is generally used by emergency communications dispatchers, call-takers, and 911 operators in centralized, public-safety call centers, as well as by field personnel utilizing mobile data terminals (MDTs) or mobile data computers (MDCs).  

CAD systems consist of several modules that provide services at multiple levels in a dispatch center and in the field of public safety. These services include call input, call dispatching, call status maintenance, event notes, field unit status and tracking, and call resolution and disposition. CAD systems also include interfaces that permit the software to provide services to dispatchers, calltakers, and field personnel with respect to control and use of analog radio and telephone equipment, as well as logger-recorder functions.

==Methodology==
[[Image:CAD interconnect.png|thumb|right|300px|CAD systems may be interconnected with [[automatic vehicle location]] systems, [[mobile data terminal]]s, office telephones, and [[Selective calling|selective calling and push-to-talk ID]].]]Computer-assisted dispatch systems use one or more [[Server (computing)|server]]s located in a central dispatch office, which communicate with computer terminals in a communications center or with mobile data terminals installed in vehicles. There are a multitude of CAD programs that suit different department needs, but the fundamentals of each system are the same. They include:

* Log on/off times of police personnel (sworn/non-sworn)
* Generating and archiving incidents that begin with a phone call from a citizen or originate from personnel in the field
* Assigning field personnel to incidents
* Updating Incidents and logging those updates
* Generating case numbers for incidents that require an investigation
* Timestamping every action taken by the dispatcher at the terminal

In an ideal setting, a call is received by a call-taker and information about the call is inputted into the CAD template. Simply, location, reporting party and incident are the main fields that have to be populated by type-codes. For example, if there was a burglary in progress, the type-code for that incident could be "BURG"; when BURG is typed out, then the program will spell out "BURGLARY (in progress)". If the location was at the 1400 block of Madison, the type-code could be "14MAD." The reporting party information would be populated by the call-taker including last name, first name, call-back number, etc.

A typical CAD printout looks something like this based on the example above:

 -----------------------------------
 LOCATION - 1400 Madison
 RP       - Doe, John, 555-5555, 1404 Madison
 INCIDENT - BURGLARY (in progress)
 SYNOPSIS - "Caller reports a possible burglary in progress based on seeing individuals 
 inside the residence/Caller advises 2 persons inside the location and call advises 
 the current residents are on vacation."
 -----------------------------------

Again, granted as it can be seen that the fields are spelled out, the call-taker uses those abbreviations that are already predetermined in order to quickly gather and transmit the information.

The dispatcher then receives the call from the call-taker and is able dispatch the call to those available. The dispatcher's screen would show the available personnel that are dispatchable. A typical setting can be exemplified by this:

 -----------------------------------
 INCIDENT # - 110001
 LOCATION   - 1400 Madison
 RP         - Doe, John, 555-5555
 INCIDENT   - BURGLARY (In Progress)
 SYNOPSIS   - "Caller reports a possible burglary in progress based on seeing individuals 
 inside the residence/Caller advises 2 persons inside the location and call advises 
 the current residents are on vacation."
 UNITS      - 746 (Pri), 749 (Cov)
 -----------------------------------
 Units available      - (3)
 Units out of service - (2)
 
 745 - Avail.
 746 - Not Avail. Inc # 554121
 747 - Avail.
 748 - Avail.
 749 - Not Avail. Inc # 554122
 -----------------------------------  

Everything that is gathered, dispatched and disposed is usually stored in a central server in which the type codes reside, or possibly another server. All of these calls which have incident numbers attached to them can be recalled by an internal search engine.  For example, a request for a printout of all calls to Madison in the past hour could be gathered by querying the CAD program by location:

 Search by: Location
 LOCATION [         ]
 ---
 Result:
 
 (Now filled in)
   
 Search by: Location
 LOCATION [14MAD    ]
 ---
 Result: (1) Incidents

CAD can be used in a multitude of ways, whether it is for radio logs, call logs or statistical analysis.

==Consoles==
[[Image:TRANSIT cad.png|500px|thumb|right|A dispatch facility used by [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] RTD features a radio communication consoles and a GPS-based [[Automatic vehicle location|AVL]] system.

[[Image:moderne Leitstelle.jpg|thumb|Ambulance dispatch center in [[Austria]].]]
[[Image:moderne Leitstelle Arbeitsplatz.jpg|thumb|Console with CAD and voice switch]]

Typical of local government dispatching facilities, the Denver RTD's facility is one example of a transit dispatch center. Communications consoles are mounted in desk-style electronics racks. Features include multi-line telephones. Modern facilities usually include a variety of computing systems for operational and administrative purposes. 

Consoles serve as a human interface and connect to push-to-talk dispatch radio systems. Audio from all channels is processed through [[audio level compression]] circuits and is routed to two separate speakers identified as ''select'' and ''unselect''. Each has a volume control. The select channel or channels carry the highest priority communications. To prevent missed messages on critical channels, the select volume may be configured so it cannot be set to an inaudible level. Unselect channels may be used for special events, other agencies, or purposes that do not involve dispatch and may be inaudible. By pressing a button, any channel on the console can be toggled between select and unselect status. Each channel has an independent push-to-talk button, allowing the dispatcher to talk over one channel at a time. For broadcast messages, a single button transmits over all selected channels at the same time. A digital clock and an [[LED]] bar-graph or [[VU meter]] are included.  

Each channel has a label identifying it and indicator lights and buttons to control settings. A typical channel has a busy light, a call light, select light, select button, and a transmit button. The steady, red busy light indicates another dispatch position is transmitting on the channel. The flashing yellow call light indicates a field unit is talking on the channel. The call light usually blinks for several seconds after a transmission ends allowing a busy dispatcher to look up from a telephone call and determine which channel the last message came from.

Some console dispatch panels are actually a PC-based application. Such is the case of Zetron's Acom system and Avtec's Scout system. This allows for easy customization and modification of the dispatch key layout.

==Service levels and geographic information==

[[Geographic information system|Computerized mapping]], [[automatic vehicle location]], [[automatic number identification]] and [[Caller ID|caller-identification technology]] are often used to enhance the service by pinpointing the locations of both the client and the most suitable vehicle for serving the client.

Some CAD systems allow several sources of information to be combined. For example, adding automatic vehicle location (AVL) and geographic information (GIS) could improve service by getting units to a service call location faster. Ideally, CAD is connected to monitor vehicle locations provided by an AVL system. This information is used to suggest the closest vehicle to an event. How is the closest unit determined?

===Basic zone system===

The simplest system is a beat or zone map system. For example, in a community with four fire stations, a grid is overlaid on a community map. Each zone of the grid is identified with a progression of police beats, ambulance zones, transit zones, or fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;This would work for any system including taxis or parcel pick up.&lt;/ref&gt; One grid might be labeled: AB241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a fire call occurring inside this zone. The predefined order is created by persons with expertise in the service being provided, local geography, traffic, and patterns in calls for service. 

Since only basic GIS information is included, if AVL was available, it would simply display service vehicle locations on a map. The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map.

Where detailed geographic data are not available, units may be assigned based on the center of a district. To make the computing problem easier, the CAD system may use ''[[Centroid|centroids]]'' to evaluate service vehicle locations. Centroids are estimated center points within a zone. The system calculates a distance from a fire station or AVL location to a centroid point. The closest fire station, according to CAD system rules, would be assigned. Systems may use centroids that are not exactly centered in order to skew or weight system decisions. Staff based at a fire station that is physically closer by drawing a straight line on the map may be slower to reach a zone. This can occur because responding units must drive around freeways, lakes, or terrain obstructions in order to reach a zone. A centroid may be moved because 200-car freight trains often block a railroad crossing used to access a particular zone.

This is the cheapest system to develop because it requires the least detailed geographic information and the simplest calculations. Another problem occurs where several services use the same system. Police and transit, for example, may have different ideas about what boundaries define the ideal zone or how centroids should be weighted.

=== CAD using geocoding===

[[Geocoding]] is a [[translation]] system allowing addresses to be converted to X- and Y-coordinates. Someone placing a call for service has an address attached to a wired phone number or tells the dispatcher their address. For example, suppose the caller's address is ''123 Main Street''. 

The GIS or CAD system includes a look-up table. The table may identify odd-numbered addresses in the community as being on the north and east sides of streets. Addresses from 113 to 157 Main Street are identified as being along Main Street's center line between Broadway and Washington. 123 is estimated to be on the north side of Main Street somewhere closer to 113 than 157. This estimate produces a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], or a set of [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] coordinates. The coordinates are close enough to identify the closest service vehicle. This system may automatically append the name of the nearest cross-street or intersecting street.

Again, the system uses a straight-line distance to determine which service vehicle is closest to a call for service. If an AVL system is used, the CAD system will look through a list of most recent reported vehicle positions. Next, the positions are compared to the service vehicle status. The CAD system may identify several of the closest units that have a status of ''available''. The dispatcher makes an ideal choice from the CAD system shortlist.

This type of system is significantly more expensive than a zone system. The basic system may start with maps from the US Census Bureau or a county assessor's office. The quality of these maps may be good but will not be ideal for dispatching. There would normally be one or more persons on staff who would deal with data changes from new development, new streets, or data quality problems. The person would compile addresses and generate street centerlines in mapping software. Geocoding varies in accuracy depending on data sources and vendors. It normally takes years of work and planning before a system is implemented. Modern geocoded systems will often display service vehicle locations, the location of service calls, and the locations of callers on a map. This helps to disambiguate calls for service and reduces the likelihood of dispatching two reports of a single call for service as two separate calls.

Another problem comes from technologies using differing datums or coordinate systems. For example, suppose your AVL system uses degrees-decimal degrees format. The AVL display for a vehicle at the Heart Butte Post Office in Montana shows a latitude and longitude of 48.28333 N, -112.83583 W. The CAD system uses degrees-minutes-seconds format data and shows the same location as 481700N, 1125009W. How do you translate? This is sometimes a problem with neighboring CAD systems. Ideally, you should be able to send and receive calls to and from CAD systems in neighboring areas. What if the state or provincial government has standardized on a different coordinate system?

===Full GIS/AVL integration===

The most expensive and technically challenging systems fully utilize the capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) and automatic vehicle location (AVL). In these systems, the street centerlines are described as ''routable''. In addition to geocoding and accurate street centerlines, intersections have attributes or scores. Can a service vehicle turn left from eastbound Carnegie Street onto northbound Hooligan Boulevard? A scoring system is used to assess the difficulty of making the turn. At one end of the scoring system there might be an interchange where service vehicles had unrestricted access in making the turn. Perhaps both streets are one-way, making it relatively easy to turn from one onto another. In the middle scores, a left turn might be blocked occasionally by heavy traffic, a [[draw bridge]], or [[street cars]]. At the most difficult score, the two streets may cross but the lack of any interchange does not allow service vehicles to get from one to the other.

To calculate the closest service vehicles, the CAD system does a network analysis of the road system based on these routable street centerlines. It assesses the path from the service call to the AVL location of available vehicles. The system recommends the service vehicles with the shortest path. 

Routable street centerlines take into account differences between northbound and southbound lanes on a freeway or turnpike. For example, to reach a point in the southbound lanes of a turnpike, service vehicles may need to drive north to the next exit then return on the southbound side. The analysis of a routable street network takes this into account so long as the event location is accurately reported. Routable systems account for barriers like lakes by calculating the distance of the driven route rather than a straight-line distance. It is assumed the service vehicle driver knows the shortest path or that all drivers make similar numbers of wrong turns.

===Concentration===

CAD systems require support staff with special skills. This can lead to concentration of dispatch facilities, particularly where there is population growth or where automation is required to meet defined service objectives. 

In any system, concentration of facilities increases risks of outages or massive failures. In a system where the call traffic is so high that advanced technology is needed to handle routine levels of day-to-day calls, relatively minor failures can have major effects on service levels. For example, where everyone is used to the convenience of automatic vehicle location (AVL), an AVL outage can suddenly increase staff workloads. Suppose a failure causes a condition where CAD cannot recommend a closest unit. How will the dispatcher efficiently assess which unit to assign?

==Data exchange (EDI)==

In public safety systems, standards are under discussion to allow disparate systems to exchange call information. For example, a call taker at the county [[fire department]] receives a call for an auto accident inside a city limit. Evolving standards will allow CAD systems to send messages to one another for calls originating outside local jurisdiction. Some entities have arrangements that already support data exchange between systems, but standards aim to make these interconnections more common. Because of auditing trail and fail-safe needs, the problem is more complex than it sounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apcointl.org/about/datatransfer/index.html#Focus_Group_Three_DTC_FG3 Associated Public-Safety Communications Officers web site, Data Transfer Committee, Focus Group III.] The A.P.C.O. refers to this as Project 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of EDI applied to CAD is specific to the law enforcement community and should not be confused with Electronic Document Interchange (EDI) standards for eCommerce. Within law enforcement EDI is used as a buzzword to represent all electronic automated messaging. 

More mature efforts to interconnect CAD can be found in the standards developed for the Intelligent Transportation Initiatives program of Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.dot.gov/ Intelligent Transportation Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative sponsored the IEEE 1512 series of protocols for emergency management&lt;ref&gt;[http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc32/imwg/index.html IEEE Incident Management Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides sophisticated means to coordinate incidents across operations centers using CAD software.

Additional work is occurring under the [[National Information Exchange Model]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niem.gov NIEM.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; to link homeland security with CAD.  Also the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] international standards body has produced standards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=emergency OASIS EM TC and EDXL Emergency Data Exchange Language]&lt;/ref&gt; funded in part by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] and the disaster management e-gov initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egov.gov Egov.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; to communicate in emergencies.

Other interoperability technologies can bridge disparities between the data-format, software, and hardware that constitute various computer-aided dispatch systems in various jurisdictions. ''Middleware'', software and servers (data brokers), can translate and integrate various systems into a seamless automated dispatch system. One example of such middleware (provided by Utah-based FATPOT Technologies/CII)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatpot.com Fatpot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; exists in Orange County, Calif., where the Fire Authority has integrated different emergency service answering points into a seamless dispatching network. A similar project was completed for the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Project (SVRIP), and is part of the Dept. of Homeland Security's CADIP report.

[[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] use the [[ICEMS]] protocol for messaging between different CAD systems operated by various emergency services organisations.

==Part of business enterprise computing system==

In business use of CAD, the dispatch system may be a module or part of a larger enterprise computing system. Rather than having multiple infrastructures, being able to have a single infrastructure with many applications running on it is important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrievercommunications.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=45 Multiple Applications with Same Infrastructure] A Model for Applications, Sourced March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the high end of enterprise integration for CAD there is SOS. SOS or ''systems of systems'' is a methodology and a set of technology for linking distributed independent applications into one meta-system or system of systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[System of systems]] System of Systems&lt;/ref&gt; These methods were originally being used at DOD for command and control (C2) but have now been applied to dispatch in efforts like the Department of Transportation Intelligent Transportation System at the Transportation Management Centers&lt;ref&gt;[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/trans_mgmnt.htm Ops.fhwa.dot.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and other efforts involving DHS counterterrorism or fusion centers.  Some local jurisdictions have also integrated their dispatch systems using EAI (Electronic Application Integration) software.

==Recent developments==
[[Computer aided call handling]] (CACH) is built on the premise that effective call handling is the foundation for an efficient dispatch response.  By using structured call handling and a series of risk calculations, such systems can make objective dispatch recommendations based on information provided by the caller.

A '''concession''' or '''concession agreement''' is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-concession-agreement.htm#did-you-know What is a concession agreement?], wisegeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public services]] such as [[water supply]] may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out [[investment]] in a public utility (such as a [[water privatisation]]) for a given number of years. Other forms of contracts between public and private entities, namely [[lease contract]] and [[management contract]] (in the water sector often called by the French term ''affermage''), are closely related but differ from a concession in the rights of the operator and its remuneration. A lease gives a company the right to operate and maintain a public utility, but investment remains the responsibility of the public. Under a management contract the operator will collect the revenue only on behalf of the government and will in turn be paid an agreed fee.

A grant of land or property by a government may be in return for services or for a particular use, a right to undertake and profit by a specified activity, a lease for a particular purpose. A concession may include the right to use some existing [[infrastructure]] required to carry out a business (such as a water supply system in a city); in some cases, such as [[mining]], it may involve merely the transfer of exclusive or non-exclusive [[easement]]s.

In the private sector, the owner of a concession &amp;mdash; the ''concessionaire'' &amp;mdash; typically pays either a fixed sum or a percentage of revenue to the owner of the entity from which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/concessionagreement.asp Definition of concession agreement] investorpedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of concessions within another business are [[concession stand]]s within sporting venues and movie theaters and concessions in [[department stores]] operated by other [[retailer]]s. Short term concessions may be granted as promotional space for periods as short as one day.

Depending on what the law that is related to a sector states, concession can either allow the authority to retain or keep ownership of the assets, turning over to the concessionaire and reverting the ownership back to an authority once the duration of their concession ended, or both the authority and concessionaire own the facilities.

==Early history==
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=34,36|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other examples of concessions, see ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' and [[History of rail transport in the United States|United States railroad policy]].

==European Union regulation==
Within the [[European Union]], the granting of concessions by public bodies is subject to regulation. Works concessions have been subject to award rules for some time as Directive 2004/18/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council]] on [[Government procurement in the European Union|public procurement]] applied to works concessions, and the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest has been subject to the principles of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. However, the European Parliament and the European Council issued a further Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0023&amp;from=EN Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament of the Council on the award of concession contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 February 2014 which required EU member states to introduce national legislation covering the award of concession contracts in excess of EUR 5,186,000 awarded on or after 18 April 2016.

In the UK, the threshold for concession contracts is £4,104,394.

[[File:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|'''Finance Min. [[Charlie McCreevy]]''' Reduced Irish corporate tax from 32% to 12.5% in the 1999 Finance Act, and whose 1997 Tax and Consolidation Act, laid the framework for Ireland's [[BEPS]] tax tools, the world's largest.&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;]]

'''Ireland's Corporate Tax System''' is a central component of Ireland's economy.  In 2016–17, foreign firms paid 80% of Irish corporate tax, employed 25% of the Irish labour force (paid 50% of Irish salary tax), and created 57% of Irish OECD non-farm value-add.  U.S.–controlled firms represent almost all foreign firms in Ireland and in 2017 were 25 of the top 50 Irish firms, and 70% of the revenue of the top 50 Irish firms ({{slink|#Low tax economy}}).  By 2018, Ireland had received the most U.S. {{slink|#Corporate tax inversions}} in history, and Apple was over one–fifth of Irish GDP. Academics rank Ireland as the largest [[tax haven]]; larger than the Caribbean tax haven system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/ireland-named-as-world-s-biggest-tax-haven-8tx2ngcgj|title=Ireland named as world’s biggest tax haven|publisher=The Times U.K.|date=14 June 2018|quote=Research conducted by academics at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen estimated that foreign multinationals moved €90 billion of profits to Ireland in 2015 — more than all Caribbean countries combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple logo black.svg|thumb|'''[[Apple Inc.|Apple (Ireland)]]''' Ireland's largest company, and over one-fifth of Irish GDP, whose [[Investigation of Apple's transfer pricing arrangements with Ireland|2016 EU €13 billion fine]] on their [[Double Irish]] BEPS scheme is the largest tax fine in history.&lt;ref name="taxf"/&gt;]]

Ireland's "headline" corporation tax rate is 12.5%, however, foreign multinationals pay an {{slink|#Effective tax rate (ETR)}} of under 4% on global profits "shifted" to Ireland, via Ireland's global network of bilateral [[tax treaties]].  These lower effective tax rates are achieved by a complex set of Irish [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tools which handle the largest BEPS flows in the world (e.g. the '''[[Double Irish]]''' as used by Google and Facebook, the '''[[double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]]''' as used by Microsoft and Allergan, and '''[[double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]]''' as used by Accenture, and by Apple post Q1 2015).&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;

Ireland's main {{slink|#Multinational tax schemes}} use "[[intellectual property]]" ("IP") accounting to affect the [[BEPS]] movement, which is why almost all foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the industries with substantial IP, namely technology and life sciences.  Multinationals from jurisdictions with "territorial tax" systems (i.e. almost all OECD countries), make little use of tax havens, thus, almost most foreign multinationals in Ireland date from periods when their home tax system was a "worldwide tax" system (e.g. UK pre–2009, and U.S. pre–2018); and is why there are no non–U.S./non–UK multinationals in Ireland's top 50 firms.

[[File:Ireland Trade Good Discrepancy (1995-2017).png|thumb|'''[[Apple Inc.|Apple (Ireland)]]''' The Q1 2015 restructuring of Apple's non-U.S. IP to Ireland ([[leprechaun economics]]), is the largest [[BEPS]] action in history.&lt;br&gt;[[Brad Setser]] &amp; Cole Frank ([[Council on Foreign Relations|CoFR]]).&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt;]]

As with all [[tax havens]], Ireland's GDP is artificially inflated by BEPS accounting flows.  This distortion escalated in Q1 2015 when Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history, on-shoring $300 billion of non–U.S. IP to Ireland (called "[[leprechaun economics]]").  It forced the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to abandon GDP in 2017, and replace with [[modified gross national income]] (GNI*), which removes part, but not all, of the distortions by BEPS tools.  Irish GDP was 162% of Irish GNI* in 2017.{{efn|name="gnigdp"|In contrast, EU–28 2017 GDP was 100% of EU–28 2017 GNI).&lt;ref name="eurostat2"/&gt;}} 

[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Figure 3 Network of ownership flows between countries.jpg|thumb|'''[[Corporate tax haven]]''': Ireland is ranked as one of the largest global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFCs]] in terms of connections to tax havens,&lt;ref name="xx1"/&gt; the largest global [[Tax haven#Tax haven lists|Tax Haven]] in terms of quantum of profits shielded,&lt;ref name="gbz"/&gt; and the 3rd-largest global [[Offshore financial centre#Shadow banking|Shadow Banking OFC]].&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt;]]

Ireland's corporation tax regime is integrated with Ireland's [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] tax schemes (e.g. [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPVs]] and [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIFs]]), which offer traditional [[tax haven]]-type tools to give confidential routes out of the Irish corporate tax system to Ireland's favoured [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFC]], Luxembourg, which is 50% of all outbound Irish FDI.&lt;ref name="luxx"/&gt;  This functionality has made Ireland one of the largest global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]], and the third largest global [[Offshore financial centre#Shadow banking|Shadow Banking OFC]].&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt; Irish privacy and data protection laws hide Irish tax tools from public scrutiny.  There is evidence Ireland behaves like a "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Captured state|captured state]]", fostering tax avoidance schemes.  Ireland is labelled a {{slink|#Corporate tax haven}}.

As {{slink|#Countermeasures to Ireland}}, the U.S. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA) moves the U.S to a "territorial tax" system.  The TJCA's GILTI–FDII–BEAT tax regime has seen U.S. IP–heavy multinationals (e.g. Pfizer), forecast 2019 effective tax rates that are similar to those of prior U.S. [[#Corporate tax inversions|tax inversions]] to Ireland (e.g.  Medtronic).  Ireland's corporate tax regime is also threatened by the EU's desire to introduce EU–wide anti-BEPS tool regimes (e.g. the 2020 Digital Services Tax, and the [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]).

{{See also|#Historical rates (1994–2018)}}

{{As of | November 2018}}, there are two rates of corporation tax ("CT") in the Republic of Ireland:&lt;ref name="ida1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/invest-in-ireland/ireland-corporate-tax|title=Corporate Tax regime in Ireland|publisher=[[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ida2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/IDAIreland/media/docs/publications/Taxation_2016.pdf|title=Corporate Taxation in Ireland 2016|publisher=[[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/corporation-tax-for-companies/corporation-tax/index.aspx|title=Irish Corporation Tax Portal|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*a 12.5% ''headline rate''{{efn|name="ETR"|In ''[[#ETR|Effective Tax Rates]]'' it is shown that Ireland's true CT tax rate for foreign multinationals is between 0% to 3% depending on what particular Irish BEPS tools are used. ''[[#ETR|Effective Tax Rates]]'' also shows that the ''aggregate'' CT tax rate in Ireland is between 2% and 4.5% depending on various assumptions.}} for '''trading income''' (or active businesses income in the Irish tax code); ''trading'' relates to conducting a business, not ''investment trading'';
*a 25.0% ''headline rate''{{efn|Ireland offers specific Central Bank of Ireland–regulated SPVs that foreign investors in passive Irish income can use avoid the 25% rate (and all other Irish taxes and duties), on Irish assets.  The main vehicles are the Irish [[QIAIF]] and the Irish [[Section 110 SPV]].  Public tax scandals in Ireland in 2016, revealed because Irish Section 110 SPVs have to file Irish public accounts, led to the Central Bank of Ireland to introduce the [[L–QIAIF]] vehicle to replace the Section 110 SPV for foreign investors who want to avoid the 25% passive income tax in a confidential manner.  QIAIFs and L–QIAIFs do not have to file Irish public accounts; instead filing confidential accounts with the Central Bank of Ireland which are protected under the ''Central Bank Secrecy Act'' of 1942.&lt;ref name="cba"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/central-bank-secrecy-law-will-limit-public-disclosure-of-key-documents-1.2079188|title=Powerful Central Bank secrecy laws limit public disclosure of key documents|date=January 2016|publisher=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} for '''non-trading income''' (or also called '''passive income''' in the Irish tax code); covering investment income (e.g. income from buying and selling assets), rental income from real estate, net profits from foreign trades, and income from certain land dealings and income from oil, gas and mineral exploitations in Ireland.

===Key aspects===
[[File:OECD 2018 Corporate Tax Rates.png|thumb|2018 ''headline'' corporate tax rates for all 35 OECD members (pre and post the 2017 U.S [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/us-corporate-income-tax-more-competitive/|title=The United States’ Corporate Income Tax Rate is Now More in Line with Those Levied by Other Major Nations|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=12 February 2018|author=Kyle Pomerleau}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{As of | November 2018}}, the key attributes that tax experts note regarding the Irish corporate tax system are as follows:&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BTC"/&gt;

* Low headline rate.  At 12.5%, Ireland has one of the lowest ''headline''{{efn|name="ETR"}} [[tax rates in Europe]] (Hungary 9% and Bulgaria 10% are lower); OECD average is 24.9%.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-the-world-2017/|title=Lowest and Highest Global Global Corporate Tax Rates|author=Kari Jahnsen|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Transparent.  Many of Ireland's corporation tax tools are OECD–whitelisted,&lt;ref name="CC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-awarded-high-oecd-rating-on-tax-transparency-1.3194255|title=Ireland awarded high OECD rating on tax transparency|publisher=Irish Times|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland has one of the lowest '''secrecy scores''' in the 2018 [[Financial Secrecy Index|FSI rankings]].&lt;ref name="CC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/we-have-no-problem-with-irish-tax-system-oecd-36566931.html|title='We have no problem with Irish tax system' - OECD|publisher=Irish Times|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ireland-does-not-engage-in-harmful-tax-competition-says-european-commission-1.2895658?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fireland-does-not-engage-in-harmful-tax-competition-says-european-commission-1.2895658| title=Ireland does not engage in “harmful tax competition” says European Commission| publisher=Irish Times|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Worldwide tax". Ireland is one of 6 remaining countries that use a "worldwide tax" system (Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico).&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/worldwide-taxation-very-rare/|title=Worldwide Taxation is Very Rare|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* No "thin capitalisation".  Ireland has no [[thin capitalisation]] rules, which means that Irish corporates can be financed with 100% debt, and 0% equity.&lt;ref name="du"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilloneustace.com/download/1/Publications/Tax/Holding%20Companies%20in%20Ireland.pdf|title=Holding Companies in Ireland|publisher=Dillon Eustace Law Partners (Dublin)|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Double Irish]] residency. Before 2015, Irish CT was based where a company was "managed and controlled" versus registered; the "[[Double Irish]]" ends in 2020.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* [[Double Irish arrangement#Single malt|Single Malt]] residency. Post closure of the Double Irish to new entrants in 2015, it can be recreated by wordings in selective tax treaties (e.g. Malta and UAE).&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* Extensive treaties. {{As of| March 2018}}, Ireland has bilateral tax treaties with 73 countries (the 74th, Ghana, is pending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tax-agreements/double-taxation-treaties/index.aspx?page=u|title=Double Irish Taxation Treaties|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;

* Holding company regime. Built for [[#Corporate tax inversions|tax inversions]], it gives Irish–based holding companies tax relief on withholding taxes, foreign dividends and CGT.&lt;ref name="BTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btconsulting.ie/page17/files/UK%20PLC%20Inversion.pdf|title=Inversion of UK plcs to Ireland|publisher=BT Consulting|date=2009|quote= However, in recent times, it is Ireland’s treatment of profits made by foreign subsidiaries of Irish resident companies that has been attracting attention and encouraging, in particular, UK firms to move their holding companies to Ireland and become tax resident there in order to reduce their tax burden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* [[Intellectual property]] regime.  Built for the BEPS tools of U.S. technology and life sciences firms, recognises a wide range of [[Intellectual capital|intellectual assets]] that can be charged against Irish tax; the [[CAIA arrangement]].&lt;ref name="acox2"/&gt;

* Knowledge Development Box. Ireland created the first OECD–compliant KDB in 2016 to support its IP–based BEPS tools.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;

===Structure of Irish taxation===
{{Main article|Taxation in the Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Distribution of Irish Exchequer Tax (2000 to 2017).png|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues.&lt;ref name="dof10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/annual-taxation-report.pdf|title=ANNUAL TAXATION REPORT |publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]|quote=Figure A.1: share of tax revenue 2000-2017, per cent|date=January 2018|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each year, the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]] is required to produce a report on ''Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure'' for the coming year.  The table below, is extracted from the "Tax Revenues" section of the report for the prior-year (e.g. the 2017 column is from the 2018 report), by which time the "Tax Revenues" for that year are largely known (although still subject to further revision in later years).  

[[File:Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues to GDP and GNI.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues as % of GDP / GNI*.&lt;ref name="dof10"/&gt;]]

The "Tax Revenues" quoted are ''Exchequer Tax Revenues'', and do not include ''Appropriations-in-Aid'' ("A–in–A") items, the largest being Social Security (or PRSI) which for 2015 was €10.2 billion, and other smaller items.  Irish Personal Income tax, and the two main Irish consumption taxes of VAT and Excise, have consistently been circa 80% of the total Irish Exchequer Tax Revenue, with the balance being Corporate tax.

===Transition in 1987===

[[File:Impact of Ireland Corporation Tax Regime on Ireland's Economy.jpg|thumb|Effect of Ireland's Corporate Tax system on Ireland's relative GNI-per-capita to the EU average&lt;ref name="shaxson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2015/11/11/how-ireland-became-an-offshore-financial-centre/|title=How Ireland became a tax haven and offshore financial centre|publisher=[[Nicholas Shaxson]], [[Tax Justice Network]]|date=11 November 2015|quote=The simple popular story is that Ireland used its 12.5 percent low corporate tax rate, and tax loopholes, to attract foreign multinational corporations, and built the so-called “Celtic Tiger” Irish economic boom on the back of that, helping Ireland become the single largest location outside the US for the declared pre-tax profits of U.S. firms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ireland's economic model was transformed from a predominantly agricultural-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, when the EU agreed to waive EU State-aid rules to allow Ireland's '''special rate''' of 10% for manufacturing (created in 1980–81 with the EU's agreement),&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt; to be extended to the [[special economic zone]] called the [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") in Dublin city centre in 1987.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his3"/&gt;  The transformation was accelerated when Ireland's standard corporate tax rate was reduced from 40% to 12.5% (phased in from 1996–2003), in response to the EU's 1996–1998 decision to withdraw the State-aid waiver.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;  The passing of the ''1997 Taxes and Consolidated Acts'' laid the legal foundations for the [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools used by U.S. multinationals in Ireland (e.g. the [[Double Irish]], the [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] and the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPV]]), to achieve an effective Irish CT rate, or ''[[#ETR|ETR]]'', of 0–3%.{{efn|name="ETR"}}

While low CT rates (and evern lower [[#ETR|effective tax rates]]), are a central part of Irish tax policy, non–CT ''[[Taxation in the Republic of Ireland]]'' is closer to EU–28 and OECD averages.{{efn|However, only when Irish [[Modified gross national income]] (or GNI*) is used for comparision, rather than Irish GDP which is artificially inflated and distorted by BEPS flows.

[[File:OECD Hierarchy of Taxes.png|thumb|Recreation of the OECD "Hierarchy of Taxes" used by Ireland.&lt;ref name="tsg2"/&gt;]]

In June 2018, international tax academics confirmed that Ireland was the largest global [[tax haven]], exceeding the combined flows of the entire Caribbean tax haven system.&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;  As international tax academics have shown, being a leading corporate tax haven has been a prosperous economy strategy for Ireland.&lt;ref name="mich"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/39181/921.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Tax Havens Flourish|author=[[James R.

Ireland's main foreign multinationals are from periods when their home jurisdiction had a "worldwide tax" system (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''), and since the UK switched to a "territorial tax" system in 2009–12, Ireland has been almost exclusively a U.S. corporate–[[tax haven]] (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]'').&lt;ref name="hines2016"/&gt;  In October 2014, the ''[[The Guardian]]'' quoted the Irish lead singer of ''[[U2]]'', ''[[Bono]]'' as saying that "his country’s tax policies have "brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known"".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/bono-tax-laws-bring-ireland-prosperity-apple-google-u2|title=Bono: controversial tax laws have brought Ireland the only prosperity it’s ever known|date=12 October 2014|author=Rupert Neate|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|quote=In an interview with the Observer, the Irish singer says his country’s tax policies have “brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known”.  Bono said: “We are a tiny little country, we don’t have scale, and our version of scale is to be innovative and to be clever, and tax competitiveness has brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known. “That’s how we got these companies here … We don’t have natural resources, we have to be able to attract people.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2016, award-winning Irish writer, [[Fintan O'Toole]] labeled Ireland's focus on being a U.S. corporate tax haven as the core economic model, as Ireland's OBI, (or "One Big Idea").&lt;ref name="fot1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-us-taxpayers-growing-tired-of-ireland-s-one-big-idea-1.2615065|title=US taxpayers growing tired of Ireland’s one big idea|author=[[Fintan O'Toole]]|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=16 April 2016|quote=The losses to the US budget from corporate tax avoidance are now out of control.

U.S.–controlled multinationals, either legally based in the U.S. or legally based in Ireland (e.g. tax inversions), dominate Ireland's economy.  In June 2018, the ''American Chamber of Commerce (Ireland)'' estimated the value of U.S. investment in Ireland was €334 billion, which compared to 2017 Irish [[GNI*]] [[Modified gross national income#Irish GDP versus Modified GNI (2009–2017)|of €181.2 billion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/denouncing-ireland-as-a-tax-haven-is-as-dated-as-calling-it-homophobic-because-of-our-past-37032219.html|title=Denouncing Ireland as a tax haven is as dated as calling it homophobic because of our past|publisher=Irish Independent|date=21 June 2018|quote=The total value of US business investment in Ireland - ranging from data centres to the world's most advanced manufacturing facilities - stands at $387bn (€334bn) - this is more than the combined US investment in South America, Africa and the Middle East, and more than the BRIC countries combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, [[Eurostat]] used 2015 data to show the ''gross operating surplus'' of foreign companies in Ireland was almost exclusively from U.S. companies, with the UK was a distant second, and little other foreign firm activity (see graphic).  Not only did U.S. companies rank ahead of Irish companies, but a material quantum of the ''gross operating surplus'' attributed to Irish companies, is from U.S. tax inversion such as [[Medtronic]], [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] and [[Allergan]], who are in effect, U.S.–controlled multinationals, and have little attachment to Ireland.

In 2016–2017, foreign multinationals, being entirely U.S.–controlled:

===Multinational features===

The main features regarding foreign multinationals in Ireland are:

* '''They are almost exclusively U.S.'''  U.S.–controlled multinationals are 25 of the top 50 firms in Ireland, and 70% of top 50 firm revenue (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''). This includes U.S. multinationals that are legally headquartered in Ireland (e.g. [[Medtronic]]), but who are run from the U.S. (e.g. all senior executives and the main offices are in the U.S.).&lt;ref name="ita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/article.php?id=2116085|title=Most of Ireland’s biggest companies aren’t Irish at all | publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/companies|title=2017: Ireland's Top 1,000 Companies | publisher=[[Irish Times]]| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The are from countries with "worldwide tax" systems'''.  Tax academics show that firms from "territorial tax" systems (over 95% of all countries),{{efn|name="territorial"|"Territorial tax" systems have the flexibility to apply much lower tax rates on foreign sourced income to incentivise companies to maintain their headquarters at home (e.g. Germany applies a 5% tax on foreign profits).&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="her"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Territorial Tax System Would Create Jobs and Raise Wages for U.S. Workers|url = https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/territorial-tax-system-would-create-jobs-and-raise-wages-us-workers|publisher = The Heritage Foundation|date = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the 2017 U.S. ''[[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]'', the U.S. was one of 7 remaining jurisdictions (e.g. Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico and the U.S.), to operate a "worldwide tax" system which applied a fixed single high rate of 35% tax on all worldwide income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13205.pdf|title=Territorial vs. Worldwide Corporate Taxation: Implications for Developing Countries|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=2013|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} make little use of [[tax havens]].&lt;ref name="hines2016"&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|author1=[[James R.

* '''They are mostly technology and life sciences.'''  To use Ireland's main BEPS tools, a multinational needs to have [[intellectual property]] (or "IP"),&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; which is then converted into [[intellectual capital]] and [[royalty payment]] plans, which ''shift profits'' from high–tax locations to Ireland.

===Multinational job focus===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Employment tax}}

Ireland's corporate BEPS tools emphasise job creation (either of Irish employees or of foreign employees to Ireland).  To use Irish BEPS tools, and their [[#ETR|ETR]]s of 0–3%,{{efn|name="ETR"}} the multinational must meet conditions on the [[intellectual property]] ("IP") they will be using as part of their Irish BEPS tool.  This is outlined in the Irish Finance Acts particular to each scheme, but in summary, the multinational must:&lt;ref name="cap1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intangible Assets Scheme under Section 291A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 |url = https://www.revenue.ie/ga/tax-professionals/historic-material/tax-briefing/2010/tax-briefing-issue-09-2010.pdf|publisher=[[Irish Revenue Commissioners]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-02-05.pdf|title=Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Part 9 / Chapter2)|publisher=[[Irish Revenue Commissioners]]|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prove they are carrying out a "relevant trade" on the IP in Ireland (i.e. Ireland is not just an "empty shell" through which IP passes en route to another tax haven);
* Prove the level of Irish employment doing the "relevant activities" on the IP is consistent with the Irish tax relief being claimed (the ratio has never been disclosed);{{efn|There are fewer cases of U.S. technology multinationals conducting genuine software programming origination in Ireland.  The "high-value" Irish jobs tend to be "[[language localisation]]" work (e.g. converting software into different languages) or "sales and marketing".  These are sufficient to meet the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]] criteria for a "relevant trade" and "relevant activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/ireland-s-top-tech-companies-who-pays-the-most-1.2526778|title=Google UK employees paid double their Irish equivalent|publisher=Irish Times|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appleq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/apple-tax-profits-ireland-cork|title=Apple's multi-billion dollar, low-tax profit hub: Knocknaheeny, Ireland|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Show that the average wages of the Irish employees are consistent with such a "relevant trade" (i.e. must be "high-value" jobs earning +€60,000–€90,000 per annum);{{efn|In March 2018, [[IDA Ireland]] disclosed that foreign multinationals paid €17.9 billion in wage on 210,443 Irish staff, or €85k per employee ("high-value" jobs) in 2016.&lt;ref name="IDA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Put this into an approved "business plan" (agreed with Revenue Commissioners and other State bodies, such as IDA Ireland), for the term of the tax relief scheme;
* Agree to suffer "clawbacks" of the Irish tax relief granted (i.e. pay the full 12.5% level), if they leave before the end plan (5 years for schemes started after February 2013)&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;

The percentage of Irish wage-to-profits has never been disclosed, however, commentators imply the Irish wage-roll needs to be circa 2–3% of gross Irish profits:

*  Apple employed 6,000 people in 2014, and at say €100,000 cost per employee gives a €600 million wage-roll on 2014 Irish profits of €25 billion (see table below),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-eight-facts-you-may-not-know-about-the-apple-irish-plant-36409796.html|title=Revealed Eight facts you may not know about the Apple Irish plant|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appleq"/&gt; or 2.4%
*  Google employed 2,763 people in 2014, and at say €100,000 cost per employee gives a €276 million wage roll on Google 2014 Irish profits of €12 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Irish_finance_news/articleDetail.php?Does-Google-Ireland-have-6-000-employees-in-Ireland-649|title=Does Google Ireland have 6,000 employees in Ireland?|publisher=FinFacts|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 2.3%

To the extent that the Irish jobs are performing real functions (e.g. the function is not replicated elsewhere in the Group), the cost is not a "employment tax", however, at worst case, the U.S. multinational should incur an aggregate effective Irish corporation tax of 2–6% (actual Irish BEPS tool tax of 0–3%,{{efn|name="ETR"}} plus Irish employment costs of 2–3%).  Therefore, as shown in {{slink|#Yearly returns (2001–2017)}}, while Irish CT has consistently been between 10 and 15% of Total Irish Tax, the additional employment contribution made by U.S. multinationals in Ireland, has led to strong growth in overall Irish Total Taxes.

===Key features===

====Intellectual property====
{{see also|Corporate haven#IP–based BEPS tools}}

[[File:GIPC Intellectual Property 2018 (Patents Sub-Category).png|thumb|2018 GIPC League Table: ''Patents'' Sub-Category.&lt;ref name="gipc1"/&gt;]]

Ireland's main BEPS tools use [[intellectual property]] (IP) to effect the ''profit shift'' from the higher-tax locations to Ireland, via [[royalty payment]] schemes.  To avoid incurring Irish corporation tax on these ''shifted profits'', the BEPS tools either send-on the profits to traditional tax havens (with explicit 0% CT rates) via royalty payment schemes (e.g. the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools), or use intangible capital allowances schemes to write-off the profits against Irish tax (e.g. the CAIA BEPS tool).&lt;ref name="zew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13078.pdf|title=Profit Shifting and "Aggressive" Tax Planning by Multinational Firms|publisher=[[Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung|Centre for European Economic Research]], (ZEW)|author1=Clemens Fuest|author2=Christoph Spengel|author3=Katharina Finke|author4=Jost Heckemeyer|author5=Hannah Nusser|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tilburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=143915| title=Intellectual Property Tax Planning in the light of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  | publisher=University of Tilburg | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the reason why most U.S. multinationals in Ireland are from the two largest IP–industries, namely technology companies and life sciences;&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wipo"/&gt; or, are specific companies with valuable industrial patents such as Ingersoll-Rand and Eaton Corporation.&lt;ref name="fordam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ireland describes its IP–based BEPS tools as being part of its "knowledge economy"; however, U.S. tax academics describe IP as "the leading tax-avoidance vehicle in the world".&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | page=4|title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | publisher=UCLA Law Review | date=2015 | quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax avoidance vehicle in the world today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bnrbeurs.nl/2017/02/22/the-corporate-tax-avoidance-toolbox/| title=The Corporate Tax Avoidance Toolbox|publisher=B&amp;R Beurs|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its small size, Ireland ranks 6th in the 2018 U.S. [[Global Intellectual Property Center]] (GIPC) league table of the top 50 global centres for IP–leglislation, and 4th in the important ''Patents'' sub-category (see graphic opposite).&lt;ref name="gipc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=U.S. Chamber International IP Index, 6th Edition, 2018|publisher=[[Global Intellectual Property Center]]|date=February 2018|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ireland's most important BEPS tools are all IP–based, Ireland has other BEPS tools including Transfer Pricing–based BEPS tools (e.g. [[contract manufacturing]]), and Debt–based BEPS tools (e.g. the Irish [[Section 110 SPV]], and the Irish [[L-QIAIF]]).

===="Worldwide Tax" systems====

Ireland's IP–based BEPS tools have only attracted material operations from multinationals whose home jurisdiction had a "worldwide tax" system; namely, the U.K pre–2009, and the U.S. pre–2018 (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]'').  Ireland has not attracted material technology or life sciences multinationals (outside of a specific plant, under its TP–based ''Contract Manufacturing'' BEPS tool), whose home jurisdiction operates a "territorial tax" system.  {{As of|November 2018}}, there are only 6 remaining jurisdictions in the world who operate a "worldwide tax" system, of which Ireland is one (e.g. Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico).{{efn|name="territorial"}}

In 2016, U.S. tax academic, [[James R. Hines Jr.]] showed firms from "territorial tax" systems make little use of corporate–[[tax havens]], as their tax code applied lower rates to foreign-sourced profits.&lt;ref name="hines2016"/&gt;  Hines, with German tax academics, showed the German tax code charged a CT rate of 5% to the foreign profits of German multinationals.&lt;ref name="hines2016"/&gt;  Hines was one of the most-cited sources when the U.S. [[Council of Economic Advisors]] advocated switching the U.S. tax code to a "territorial system" in the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].&lt;ref name="CRS2"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Tax%20Reform%20and%20Wages.pdf|publisher=[[Council of Economic Advisors]]|title=TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 Corporate Tax Reform and Wages: Theory and Evidence|quote=[In the Whitehouse advocating for the TCJA] Applying [[James R.

In 2014, the U.S [[Tax Foundation]], reported on how the UK had effectively stopped UK corporates [[#UK inversions|inverting to Ireland]], by switching the UK corporate tax-code to a "territorial system" over 2009-2012.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uktax1Quote"/&gt;  By 2014, the UK ''[[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]]'' reported that most of the UK multinationals that had inverted to Ireland had either returned to the UK (e.g., [[WPP plc]], [[United Busines Media plc]], [[Henderson Group plc]]), or were about to be acquired by U.S. multinationals as part of a U.S. corporate tax inversion to Ireland (e.g. [[Shire plc]]).{{efn|name="shire"|Shire's proposed 2014 corporate tax inversion with U.S. pharmaceutical [[AbbVie Inc.]] failed due to the 2016 Obama Administration anti-inversion rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/08/adderall-shire-takeover-takeda-virgin-money|title=Adderall maker Shire agrees to £46bn takeover by Takeda|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 March 2018|author=Julia Kollewe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, Shire agreed to a lower $64 billion bid from Japanese pharmaceutical [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], who confirmed they would not be executing a tax inversion to Ireland (Japan's ''headline'' corporate tax rate is 35%), which was attributed to the fact that Japan, like the UK, switched to a "territorial tax" system in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shire-m-a-takeda-pharma-deal-exclusiv/shire-willing-to-back-64-billion-takeda-bid-market-signals-doubts-idUSKBN1HV2P4|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=26 April 2018|title=Shire willing to back $64 billion Takeda bid, market signals doubts|author=Ben Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="HMRC" /&gt;

====Single Malt====
{{Main article|Single malt arrangement}}

In an October 2013 interview, [[PwC]] tax partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]] ("architect" of the Double Irish, see above), said that: "the days of the Double Irish tax scheme are numbered".&lt;ref name="fear20"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Days of 'Double Irish' tax scheme are numbered, says PwC's O'Rourke|url = https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/days-of-double-irish-tax-scheme-are-numbered-says-pwcs-orourke-29709354.html|quote=However, Mr O'Rourke, who is also a cousin of the late Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, told Bloomberg that changes in Ireland and across the globe on tax was inevitable.

====Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets====
{{Main article|CAIA arrangement}}

In June 2009, the Irish State established the ''Commission on Taxation'', to review Ireland's tax regime, and included [[Feargal O'Rourke]] ("architect" of the Double Irish, see above).&lt;ref name="fear20"/&gt; In September 2009, the Commission recommended that the Irish State provide [[capital allowance]]s for the acquisition of [[intangible assets]], creating the ''[[CAIA arrangement|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]]'' (CAIA) BEPS tool.&lt;ref name="cot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/1447| title=Commission on Taxation report 2009|date=September 2009| publisher=UCD Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1017830.shtml| title=Commission on Taxation Report Ireland 2009: Proposed property tax, a carbon tax, and domestic water charges as part of overhaul of Irish tax system|date=7 September 2009| publisher=FinFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools enable Ireland to act as a ''confidential'' "[[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFC]]" for rerouting untaxed profits to places like Bermuda (e.g. it must be ''confidential'' as higher-tax locations would not sign full tax treaties with locations like Bermuda), the CAIA BEPS tool, enables Ireland to act as the "[[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFC]]" (e.g. the terminus for untaxed profits, like Bermuda).

CAIA uses the accepted tax concept of providing [[capital allowance]]s for the purchase of physical assets.{{efn|Most tax codes in developed countries have [[capital allowance]] programs that give tax relief on capital expenditure that is amortised over the life of the physical asset on which the capital was invested in.}}  However, Ireland turns it into a BEPS tool by providing the allowances for the purchase of ''[[intangible assets]]'', and particularly ''[[intellectual property]]'' assets; and critically, where the owner of the intangible assets is a "connected party" (e.g. a Group subsidiary, often located in a tax haven); and has valued the assets for the inter-Group transaction using an Irish [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] accounting firm. 

CAIA ''capitalises'' the tax shield of the Double Irish, and thus materially increases the distortion of the Irish national accounts.  This was shown in July 2016 when the Irish CEO had to restate Irish 2015 GDP by 34.4% due to Apple's Q1 2015 "[[leprechaun economics]]" restructure into a CAIA BEPS tool.&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|author=Jesse Drucker|author2=Simon Bowers|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2018 report by the EU Parliament's [[European United Left-Nordic Green Left|GUE–NGL]] body showed that Apple doubled the Irish corporate tax shield of its CAIA BEPS tool by financing the acquisition of the IP via Jersey (the report called the CAIA BEPS tool, the ''[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]'').&lt;ref name="emmaclancy"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.taxjustice.net/2018/06/25/new-report-is-apple-paying-less-than-1-tax-in-the-eu/|title=New Report on Apple's New Irish Tax Structure|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|author=Naomi Fowler|date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emma"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://src.bna.com/zNy|title=Apple's Irish Tax Deals|publisher=[[European United Left-Nordic Green Left]] EU Parliament|author1=Martin Brehm Christensen|author2=Emma Clancy|date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Double Irish and Single Malt have an ETR of less than 1%, the ETR of the CAIA BEPS tool ranges from 0% to 3% depending on the date on which the CAIA tool was started (see [[#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]]).{{efn|name="cap"}}&lt;ref name="coxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maples"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mhc.ie/latest/e-zines/world-ip-day-2014/P1|title=World IP Day: IRELAND'S 2.5% IP Tax Rate (Section 4.1.1)|publisher=Mason Hayes and Curran (Law Firm)|date=April 2013|quote=When combined with other features of Ireland’s IP tax regime, an effective rate as low as 2.5% can be achieved on IP related income}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knowledge Development Box====

Ireland created the first OECD–compliant '''Knowledge Development Box''' ("KDB"), in the 2015 ''Finance Act'', to further support it's [[intellectual property]] [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] toolkit.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/business/budget/budget-2016-do-you-know-what-the-knowledge-box-is-31576795.html|title=Do you know what the Knowledge Box is?|publisher=Irish Indepdendant|date=9 October 2015|author=Michael Cogley|quote=The initial announcement of the KDB came after the closure of the ‘double Irish’ tax loophole and while he does not see it as a knee-jerk reaction Ken Hardy, tax partner at KPMG believes it is an attempt to keep Ireland’s tax scheme as competitive as possible.  However, other European countries, including Germany, have warned that these incentives should only be used as a reward for R&amp;D investment and not as a tax avoidance to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KDB behaves like a [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|CAIA]] BEPS scheme with a cap of 50% (i.e. similar to getting 50%–relief against capitalised IP, for a net effective Irish tax rate of 6.25%). As with the CAIA BEPS scheme, the KDB is limited to specific "qualifying assets", however, unlike CAIA tool, these are quite narrowly defined by the 2015 ''Finance Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-29/29-03-01.pdf|title=Revenue Guidance Notes for Knowledge Development Box|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bdo.ie/en-gb/insights/tax/knowledge-development-box/knowledge-development-box-(kdb)|title=Guidelines Knowledge Development Box|publisher=BDO Ireland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The Irish KDB was created with tight conditions to ensure OECD compliance and thus meets the OECD's "modified Nexus standard" for IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-action-5-agreement-on-modified-nexus-approach-for-ip-regimes.pdf|title=Action 5 Agreement on Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes|publisher=OECD|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has drawn criticism from Irish tax advisory firms who feel that its use is limited to pharmaceutical (who have the most "Nexus" compliant patents/processes), and some niche sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/tax/articles/knowledge-development-box-ireland.html|title=Knowledge Development Box Improvements Needed|publisher=Deloitte Ireland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/ie/en/home/insights/2016/04/kdb-best-in-class.html|title=Knowledge Development Box: Best in Class?|publisher=KPMG Ireland|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected these conditions will be relaxed over time through refinements of the 2015 ''Finance Act''; a route taken by other Irish [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS]] tools:

* [[Double Irish]] – the unusual definition of tax residence was embedded in the 1997 ''Taxes and Consolidation Act'' (TCA), and expanded in 1999-2003 ''Finance Acts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-02/02-02-03.pdf|title=Guidance on Tax Residence Irish Revenue|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double Irish arrangement#Single malt|Single Malt]] – takes the Double Irish tax-residence concept around "management and control", and worded directly into specific bilateral tax treaties (Malta, UAE).&lt;ref name="ca"/&gt;
* [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] – introduced in the 1997 TCA but expanded in the 2009 ''Finance Act'',&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt; and made tax-free in the 2015 ''Finance Act'' for Apple.{{efn|name="cap"}}&lt;ref name="app1"/&gt;
* [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPVs]] – created in the 1997 TCA with strong anti-avoidance controls, which were eroded in 2003, 2008, 2011 ''Finance Acts'' (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110]] article).
* [[L–QIAIFs]] – [[QIAIF]]s were introduced in 2013 with the new EU [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011|AIFMD]] regulations, but expanded in 2018 into a full [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tool]].

Irish tax-law firms expect the Irish KDB terms will be brought into alignment with the CAIA BEPS tool terms in the future.&lt;ref name="KDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.matheson.com/images/uploads/documents/KDB_Matheson.pdf|title=Knowledge Development Box Public Consultation and Observations|publisher=Matheson|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 110 SPV====
{{main article|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}

[[File:Stephen Donnelly 2016.jpg|thumb|'''[[Stephen Donnelly|Stephen Donnelly TD]]''' Estimated U.S. funds would avoid €20 billion in Irish taxes from 2016–2026 on circa €40 billion of Irish investments (2012–2016), by using Section 110 SPVs.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephendonnelly.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Closing-Down-Section-110-for-Vulture-Funds.pdf | title=WHY LETTING SECTION 110 SPVS OPERATE IN THE IRISH DOMESTIC ECONOMY WILL DAMAGE OUR TAX BASE AND OUR REPUTATION AS A ‘LOW-TAX’ ECONOMY | publisher=Stephen Donnelly (Dail Submission)|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle''' ("SPV") is an Irish [[tax resident]] company, which qualifies under Section 110 of the 1997 ''Irish Taxes Consolidation Act'' (“TCA”), by virtue of restricting itself to only holding "qualifying assets", for a special tax regime that enables the SPV to attain full tax neutrality (i.e. the SPV pays no Irish corporate taxes).  It is a major Irish [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS]] tool.  

Section 110 was created to help [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") legal and accounting firms compete for the administration of global [[securitisation]] deals.

These [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|abuses]] were discovered because Section 110 SPVs must file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].  In 2018 [[Central Bank of Ireland]] overhauled the little-used [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF|L–QIAIF]] vehicle, so that is now offers the same tax benefits on Irish assets held via debt as the Section 110 SPV, but without having to file Irish public accounts.

The Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIF]] regime is exempt from all Irish taxes and duties (including VAT and withholding tax), and apart from the VCC wrapper, do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].  This has made [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIF]] an important "backdoor" out of the Irish corporate tax system.  The most favoured destination is to [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] Luxembourg, which receives 50% of all outbound Irish [[foreign direct investment]] ("FDI).&lt;ref name="luxx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/06/28/Ireland-Selected-Issues-46027|page=20|quote=Figure 3.

When the Section 110 SPV Irish domestic tax avoidance [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|scandals]] surfaced in late 2016, it was due to Irish financial journalists and [[Dail Eireann]] representatives scrutinising the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] public accounts of U.S. distressed firms.  In November 2016 the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] began to overhaul the [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L-QIAIF]] regime.  In early 2018, the Central Bank upgraded the [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L-QIAIF]] regime so that it could replicate the Section 110 SPV (e.g. closed end debt structures), but without needing to file public [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] accounts.  In June 2018, the Central Bank announced that €55 billion of U.S. distressed debt assets had transferred out of Section 110 SPVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/tax-free-funds-once-favoured-by-vultures-fall-55bn-1.3546101|title=Tax-free funds once favoured by ‘vultures’ fall €55bn: Regulator attributes decline to the decision of funds to exit their so-called ‘section 110 status’|publisher=Irish Times|date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that the Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L–QIAIF]] will replace the Irish Section 110 SPV as Ireland's main [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tool]] for U.S. multinationals in Ireland.

The ability of foreign institutions to use QIAIFs (and particularly the ICAV wrapper) to avoid all Irish taxes on Irish assets has been blamed for the bubble in Dublin commercial property (and, by implication, the Dublin housing crisis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/tax-breaks-for-commercial-property-will-fuel-bubble-35189754.html| title=Tax breaks for commercial property will fuel bubble| quote=They'll do this by making commercial property investment, mainly by large foreign landlords, entirely tax free.

===TP–based BEPS tools===

Ireland's [[transfer pricing]] ("TP") based BEPS tools are mostly related to [[contract manufacturing]].  By refusing to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive (and invoking exemptions on reporting holding company structures until 2022), Ireland enables their TP and IP–based BEPS tools to structure as "unlimited liability companies" (ULCs) which do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].&lt;ref name="acc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2018/06/25/new-report-is-apple-paying-less-than-1-tax-in-the-eu/|title=New report: is Apple paying less than 1% tax in the EU?|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=28 June 2018|quote=The use of private "unlimited liability company" (ULC) status, which exempts companies from filing financial reports publicly. The fact that Apple, Google, and many others continue to keep their Irish financial information secret is due to a failure by the Irish government to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive, which would require full public financial statements, until 2017, and even then retaining an exemption from financial reporting for certain holding companies until 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2018/07/04/irelands-playing-games-in-the-last-chance-saloon-of-tax-justice/|title=Ireland's playing games in the last chance saloon of tax justice|publisher=[[Richard Murphy (tax campaigner)|Richard Murphy]]|date=4 July 2018|quote=Local subsidiaries of multinationals must always be required to file their accounts on public record, which is not the case at present. Ireland is not just a tax haven at present, it is also a corporate secrecy jurisdiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of this, many Irish IP–based BEPS tools are so large that tax academics have been able to separate out their scale from filed group accounts (e.g. work of [[Gabriel Zucman]]).  However, Irish TP–based BEPS tools are smaller, and therefore harder to pick out from a listed multinational's group accounts.  In addition, the Irish State, to help obfuscate the activities of the larger and more important IP–based BEPS tools, sometimes present their data as ''manufacturing'' data, and blended in with TP–based BEPS data; the example of how the Irish State [[Leprechaun economics#Obfuscation of source|obfuscated]] Apple's Q1 2015 CAIA BEPS tool, by crediting the 2015 [[leprechaun economics]] GDP growth rate to contract manufacturing and aircraft leasing activities is a notable case.  It is generally regarded that Ireland's main TP–based BEPS tool users are the life sciences manufacturers.

=={{anchor|ETR}}Effective tax rate (ETR)==

===Background===

The ''headline'' tax rate is the rate of taxation that is applied to the profits that a tax-code deems to be taxable after deductions.  The ''effective'' tax rate is the rate of taxation implied by the actual quantum of tax paid versus profits before all deductions are applied.  The gap between the Irish corporate ''headline'' rate of 12.5%, and the much lower Irish corporate ''effective'' rate of 2–4%, is a source of controversy:  

{{quote|Many of the multinationals gathered at the Four Seasons [in Dublin, Ireland] that day pay far less than 12.5 percent tax, their accounts show.

The Irish State asserts Ireland's ETR similar to the Irish ''headline'' CT rate of 12.5%.&lt;ref name="cnbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/11/irish-pm-counters-corporate-tax-rate-claims-.html|title=Irish PM counters corporate tax rate claims|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important issue as Ireland's BEPS tools, the core of Ireland's {{slink|#Low tax economy}}, rely on having a global network of full bilateral tax treaties that accept Ireland's BEPS tools; major economies do not sign full bilateral tax treaties with known tax havens (e.g. Bermuda or Jersey).&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2013/11/06/if-ireland-is-not-a-tax-haven-what-is-it/#79ff76d37746|title=If Ireland Is Not A Tax Haven, What Is It?|publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]]||author=Martin Sullivan|date=November 2014|quote=They cannot have their regional headquarters located in a jurisdiction that--whether fairly or unfairly--has obtained a reputation for less-than-aboveboard business dealings.

In 2014, Ireland refused to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive, and invoked exemptions on reporting holding company structures until 2022, so that multinationals can register as Irish "unlimited liability companies" (ULCs), which do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].&lt;ref name="acc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acc2"/&gt;  However, as most foreign multinationals in Ireland are major U.S. listed companies (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''), tax academics have been able to estimate their Irish ETR from U.S. filings.  In addition, the 2014–2016 EU investigation into Apple, Ireland's largest company, produced detail on Apple's Irish ETR from 2004–2014.

In February 1994, the most cited academic in tax haven research,&lt;ref name="respec"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?form=extended&amp;wm=wrd&amp;dt=range&amp;ul=&amp;q=tax+haven&amp;cmd=Search%21&amp;wf=4BFF&amp;s=C&amp;db=&amp;de=|title=IDEAS/RePEc Database|quote=Tax Havens by Most Cited}}&lt;/ref&gt; American tax economist [[James R. Hines Jr.]], published the most cited academic paper on tax havens,&lt;ref name="respec"/&gt; titled: "Fiscal Paradise: Foreign Tax Havens and American Business"; which estimated in Appendix IV that Ireland's ''aggregate'' effective corporate rate (ETR) was 4%.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; 

In October 2013, Bloomberg commissioned a ''Special Investigation'' into the tax affairs of U.S. multinationals in Ireland, which estimated that the effective tax rate of all U.S. multinationals in Ireland had fallen to 3% by 2010.&lt;ref name="bberg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/infographics/u-s-profits-in-ireland-pile-up.html|title=Ireland: Where Profits Pile Up, Helping Multinationals Keep Taxes Low|publisher=Bloomberg News|quote=Meanwhile, the tax rate reported by those Irish subsidiaries of U.S. companies plummeted to 3% from 9% by 2010|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report featured research into the "architect" of the Double Irish BEPS tool, PWC tax partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]], who Bloomberg noted was regarded as a "hero" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="fr1"/&gt;

In February 2014, [[Trinity College, Dublin]] Professor of Finance, Dr. Jim Stewart, author of studies into Ireland's tax systems,&lt;ref name="jimst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jimstew"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tasc.ie/download/pdf/apple_tax_case.pdf|title=Apple Tax Case and the Implications for Ireland|page=19|author=Professor Jim Stewart|publisher=[[Trinity College, Dublin]]|quote=It is important to note that the most attractive aspect of [corporate] tax incentives offered by Ireland is not the [headline 12.5%] tax rate but the tax regime|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the U.S. [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] data filed by U.S. multinationals on their global operations, to estimate that the effective tax rate of U.S. multinationals in Ireland for 2011 was 2.2% to 3.8% (depending on assumptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/corporate-tax-calculations-1.1689233?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fcorporate-tax-calculations-1.1689233|quote=A study by Dr Jim Stewart, associate professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, suggests that in 2011 the subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals in Ireland paid an effective tax rate of 2.2 per cent. |title=Effective Corporate Tax calculations: 2.2%|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/multinationals-escape-tax-due-to-exceptional-rules-study-claims-1.1784447|title=Multinationals escape tax due to ‘exceptional’ rules, study claims|publisher=Irish Times|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the ''[[Tax Justice Network]]'', in their ''Ireland Country Report'' from the 2013 [[Financial Secrecy Index]], said the Irish State's claims that the effective tax rate was 12.5% were "misleading", and that Ireland's corporate ETR was between 2.5% to 4.5%, depending on the various assumptions used.&lt;ref name="tjn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/Archive2013/Country%20Reports/Ireland.pdf|title=TAX JUSTICE NETWORK: Ireland Financial Secrecy Index Country Report 2014|quote=Misleadingly, studies cited by the Irish Times and other outlets suggest that the effective tax rate is close to the headline 12.5 percent rate – but this is a fictional result based on a theoretical 'standard firm with 60 employees' and no exports: it is entirely inapplicable to transnationals.

In November 2017, Irish economist [[David McWilliams (economist)|David McWilliams]] writing in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' quoted that the U.S. BEA statistics implied that U.S. multinationals in Ireland paid an effective tax rate of 3.27% on Irish registered pre-tax income of $106,789 million in 2013, and 3.38% on Irish registered pre-tax income of $108,971 million in 2014, due to "a myriad of loopholes to avoid even our own low rates of tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/david-mcwilliams-a-new-economic-plan-for-ireland-1.3294430|title=A new economic plan for Ireland|date=18 November 2017|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=[[David McWilliams (economist)|David McWilliams]]|quote=Our corporation tax rate is 12.5 per cent, so they should be paying about €12 billion a year in tax.

As discussed above, because Ireland refused to ratify the 2013 EU Accounting Directive, many of these multinationals have switched to "unlimited liability companies" in Ireland, which do not file accounts; thus the information is only available in a few cases.  However, where U.S. multinationals have disclosed Irish financials, they all imply an Irish ETR of less than 1 percent.{{efn|Note that the accounts referenced below are from U.S. multinationals in Ireland who were at the time of filing, [[Double Irish arrangement#Multinationals who used Irish BEPS tools|known to be using]] the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools; they thus reflect the ETR of these specific Irish BEPS tools.}}

===Marketing brochures===

Irish BEPS tools are not overtly marketed as brochures showing near-zero effective tax rates would damage Ireland's ability to sign and operate bilateral tax treaties (i.e. higher-tax countries do not sign full treaties with known tax havens).{{efn|name="treaty"|In September 2018, Ireland had a global network of 73 bilateral tax treaties, and a 74th with Ghana awaiting ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tax-agreements/double-taxation-treaties/index.aspx|title=Revenue: Double Taxation Treaties|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, in the Irish financial crisis, some Irish tax law firms in the [[Irish Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] produced CAIA brochures openly marketing that its ETR was 2.5%.{{efn|name="cap"|When the Irish State applied a cap of 80% on the total amount of Irish intangible capital allowances that can be used against taxable profits in any year, it gave an Irish effective tax rate (ETR) of 2.5% for the CAIA BEPS tool, being the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5% multiplied by 20%. Therefore, the ETR of the CAIA is often described as being 0–2.5%, depending on the Irish State rules regarding caps at the date the CAIA scheme was started. During Apple's restructure into an Irish CAIA BEPS tool in Q1 2015, the cap was temporarily lifted to 100% (e.g. the ETR was 0%).&lt;ref name="app1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fcliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383|title=Change in tax treatment of intellectual property and subsequent and reversal hard to fathom|author=Cliff Taylor|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="maples"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acox2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ireland as a Location for Your Intellectual Property Trading Company|url = http://www.arthurcox.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Arthur-Cox-Ireland-as-a-location-for-your-IP-Trading-Company-April-20152.pdf|publisher=Arthur Cox Law|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coxx"/&gt;

===Apple investigations===
{{Main article|EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland}}

Apple is Ireland's largest company, with Irish 2017 revenues that exceed the combined Irish 2017 revenues of the next 5 largest Irish companies added together.  Apple has been in Ireland since at least December 1980, when it opened its first Irish plant in Holyhill, in Cork.&lt;ref name="DUHIGG"/&gt;  Apple's tax strategies with Irish BEPS tools had long been under suspicion by tax academics and investigative journalists.&lt;ref name="rotten apple"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08853908.2017.1356250|title=The Rotten Apple: Tax Avoidance in Ireland|journal=The International Trade Journal|volume=32|pages=150|date=2 August 2017|publisher=The International Trade Journal|doi=10.1080/08853908.2017.1356250|last1=Barrera|first1=Rita|last2=Bustamante|first2=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apple"/&gt;

In May 2013, Apple's Irish tax practices were questioned by a U.S. bipartisan investigation of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation]].&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/media/subcommittee-to-examine-offshore-profit-shifting-and-tax-avoidance-by-apple-inc|title=Majority Media {{!}} Media {{!}}  Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hsgac.senate.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation aimed to examine whether Apple used [[Offshore financial centre|offshore structures]], in conjunction with arrangements, to shift profits from the U.S. to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/05/21/apples-profit-shifting-claims-were-in-humpty-dumpty-territory-here/#71b220cc50c2|title=Apple's Profit Shifting Claims: We're In Humpty Dumpty Territory Here|last=Worstall|first=Tim|date=21 May 2013|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Carl Levin]] and [[John McCain]] drew light on what they referred to as a special tax arrangement between Apple and Ireland which allowed Apple to pay a [[Corporate tax|corporate tax rate]] of less than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0531/453905-ambassador-us-tax/|title=US Senator repeats Irish 'tax haven' claim|last=|first=|date=31 May 2013|work=|newspaper=RTE.ie|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/142660268/Subcommittee-Memo-on-Offshore-Profit-Shifting-Apple|title=Offshore Profit Shifting and the U.S. Tax Code - Part 2 (Apple Inc.)|author1=Senator Carl Levin|author2=Senator John McCain|publisher=US Senate|quote=A number of studies show that multinational corporations are moving "mobile" income out of the United States into low or no tax jurisdictions, including tax havens such as Ireland, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands.|page=3| date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-ambassador-letter-us-senate-corporate-tax-932838-May2013/|title=Senators insists Ireland IS a tax haven, despite ambassador's letter: Carl Levin and John McCain have dismissed the Irish ambassador's account of Ireland's corporate tax system.|publisher=thejournal.ie|quote=Senators LEVIN and McCAIN: Most reasonable people would agree that negotiating special tax arrangements that allow companies to pay little or no income tax meets a common-sense definition of a tax haven.| date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-tax/ireland-rejects-u-s-senator-claims-as-tax-spat-rumbles-on-idUSBRE94U0VU20130531|title=Ireland rejects U.S. senator claims as tax spat rumbles on|publisher=Reuters|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigation labelled Ireland as the "holy grail of tax avoidance".&lt;ref name="holygrail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/the-holy-grail-of-tax-avoidance-schemes-was-made-in-the-us-1.1878617|title=The 'Holy Grail of tax avoidance schemes' was made in the US|publisher=Irish Times|quote=|date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-is-apples-holy-grail-of-tax-avoidance-918345-May2013/|title=Ireland is Apple's 'Holy Grail of tax avoidance': The firm pays just two per cent tax on profits in Ireland but has denied using any "tax gimmicks".|publisher=journal.ie|quote=|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the EU Commission launched an investigation into Apple's tax practices in Ireland for the period 2004–2014, whose summary findings were published on 30 August 2016 in a 4–page [[press release]];&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  with a 130–page report, including partially redacted information on Apple's Irish business (e.g. profits, employees, Board minutes etc.), published on 30 August 2016.&lt;ref name="eu1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cliff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-s-irish-company-structure-key-to-eu-tax-finding-1.2775684|title=Apple’s Irish company structure key to EU tax finding|last=Taylor|first=Cliff|date=2 September 2016|work=|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=14 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner [[Margrethe Vestager]] stated: "In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005 per cent in 2014".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Irish State rebuttals===

In February 2014, as a result of Bloomberg's ''Special Investigation'' and Trinity College Professor Dr. Jim Stewart's ETR calculations (see above), the "architect" of Ireland's Double Irish BEPS tool, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]], went on ''[[RTE Radio]]'' to state that: "there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon", in the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/multinationals-paid-2-2-per-cent-tax-1310050-Feb2014/|title=Multinational companies paid just 2.2 per cent tax in 2011 - report|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=15 February 2014|author=Paul Hosford|quote=[Dr. Stewart] criticised the report’s use of a single company for a host of countries across the world, telling RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the PWC report was based on a “fictitious or hypothetical” company, adding:  You can’t say we have an effective tax rate of 11.9 per cent. Fergal O’Rourke from PWC, however, defended his company’s findings, saying that Stewart was counting companies incorporated in Ireland, but that had never operated here. “There’s a hole the size of the Grand Canyon in the data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1027229.shtml|title=Corporate Tax 2014: Feargal O'Rourke's Irish tax fairytales and "meaningless" US data|publisher=Finfacts|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Rourke also referenced the PricewaterhouseCoopers/World Bank survey that Ireland's ETR was circa 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9b4fd34-ca3f-11e3-8a31-00144feabdc0|title=Tax avoidance: The Irish inversion|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=29 April 2014|author1=Vanessa Houlder|author2=Vincent Boland|author3=James Politi|quote=Call it the ceramic flower pot dilemma. The headline rate of Irish corporation tax is 12.5 per cent, and calculations by PwC and the World Bank show the effective rate of tax levied on foreign company profits in Ireland is about 11.9 per cent. Yet a recent study by Jim Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin, shows some US multinational subsidiaries operating in Ireland paid an effective rate of tax of just 2.2 per cent on their Irish activities in 2011. Prof Stewart argued that, in order for PwC and the World Bank to compare tax rates across the world, they created a hypothetical company that does not engage in tax planning, and was “small, domestically owned, has no imports or exports and produces and sells ceramic flower pots”. Such a company bears no resemblance to the US multinationals that operate in Ireland, ranging from big pharma (Pfizer, Alexion) to big tech (Intel, Google, Apple, Facebook).}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="pwcrates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/Technical_Paper_Effective_Rates_Corporation_Tax_Ireland.pdf|title=Effective Corporate Tax in Ireland: April 2014|publisher=Department of Finance|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cantillon-transparency-the-first-victim-in-tax-debate-1.1695254|title=Cantillon: Transparency the first victim in tax debate|publisher=Irish Times|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the Irish [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]], gathered a panel of Irish experts (but no international experts) to estimate Irish corporate ETR for the Committee on Finance Public Expenditure.&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;  The results, summarised on Section 2 (page 13) of the report, showed all of the Irish experts, with the exception of Dr. Jim Stewart, agreed with Feargal O'Rourke and PricewaterhouseCoopers:

==Corporate tax inversions==
{{see also|Tax inversion}}

===Background===

An Irish '''[[corporate tax inversion]]''' is a strategy in which a foreign multinational acquires or merges with an Irish–based company, and then shifts its legal place of incorporation to Ireland to avail of Ireland's favourable corporate tax regime; however, the multinational's majority ownership, ''effective headquarters'' and executive management stay in its home jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/what-are-tax-inversions-1.2598741|title=What are tax inversions?|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=5 April 2016|quote=Inversions are in essence, a financial exercise which allow companies to lower their tax bills by acquiring a legal address abroad.

Almost all tax inversions to Ireland have come from the U.S., and to a lesser degree, the UK (see below); the first U.S. tax inversions to Ireland were [[Ingersoll Rand]] and [[Accenture]] 2009,&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt; and as of November 2018, Ireland was also the destination for the largest U.S. corporate tax inversion in history, namely the $81 billion merger of [[Medtronic]] and [[Covidien]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="medtronic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/slideshow/14222919/1/as-treasury-moves-to-bring-back-inversions-here-are-seven-of-the-biggest-recent-deals.html|title=As Treasury Moves to Bring Back Inversions, Here are 7 of the Biggest Recent Deals|author=Emily Stewart|date=22 July 2017|publisher=TheStreet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. tax code's anti-avoidance rules prohibit a U.S. company simply creating a new "legal" headquarters in Ireland while its main business is in the US (known as a "self-inversion").&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;  Up until April 2016, the U.S. tax code would only consider the inverted company as foreign (i.e. outside the U.S. tax-code), where the inversion was part of an acquisition, and the Irish target was at least 20% of the value of the combined group; although the Irish target had to be over 40% of the combined group for the inversion to be fully considered as outside of the U.S. tax-code.&lt;ref name="rules2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbesinversion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2014/09/10/the-tax-inversion-rush-in-one-handy-graphic/#4b2eac18bf02|title=The Tax Inversion Rush: One Handy Graphic|publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]]|author=Janet Novack|date=10 September 2014|quote=The U.S. company is in black, as is the share of the merged company its current shareholders will own; it must be less than 80% for the tax trick to work under the current law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inverted, the U.S. company can use Irish [[#Multinational tax schemes|multinational BEPS strategies]] to achieve an [[#ETR|effective tax rate]] well below the Irish headline rate of 12.5% on non–U.S. income, and also reduce U.S. taxes on U.S. income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Bloomberg Special TAX INVERSION|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2014, ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'' quoted research that estimated a U.S. inversion to Ireland reduced the U.S. multinational's ''aggregate'' tax rate from above 30% to well below 20%.&lt;ref name="forbesinversion"/&gt;

In July 2015, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Ireland's lower ETR made U.S. multinationals who inverted to Ireland highly acquisitive of other U.S. firms (i.e. they could afford to pay more to acquire U.S. competitors to re-domicile them to Ireland), and listed the post-inversion acquisitions of Activis/Allergan, Endo, Mallinckrodt and Horizon.&lt;ref name="wsjinversions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/horizon-pharma-at-the-nexus-of-taxes-and-deals-1436296946|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|author=Liz Hoffman|date=7 July 2015|quote=Horizon and other inverted companies are using their new, lower tax rates to turbocharge corporate takeovers.

Moreover, unlike the U.S., Ireland and most other countries, only tax profits earned in-country, giving companies the freedom and incentive to shift income to still-lower-tax jurisdictions.|title=The Tax Inversion Wave Keeps Rolling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Irish [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] (CSO) warned that tax inversions to Ireland artificially inflated Ireland's GDP data (e.g. without providing any Irish tax revenue).

{{See also|Double Irish#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act}}
In April 2016, the Obama administration announced new tax rules to increase the threshold for a U.S. corporate tax inversion to be considered a "foreign company", and thus escape U.S. taxation.  The new rules were directly designed to block the proposed $160 billion merger of U.S.–based Pfizer and Irish–based Allergan, which would have been the largest corporate tax inversion in history.&lt;ref name="rules1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/69f01f50-fbbc-11e5-8f41-df5bda8beb40|title=Collapse of $160bn Pfizer and Allergan merger shocks corporate US|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=6 April 2015|author1=Barney Jopson|author2=David Crow|author3=James Fontanella-Khan|author4=Arash Massoudi|quote=The collapse of Pfizer’s $160bn merger with Allergan on Wednesday brought the total value of abandoned deals this year to its highest since the eve of the financial crisis and sent shockwaves through corporate America.

That’s led companies to keep their inversions below 60%—and prompted the government to propose rules halting various techniques for doing so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Trump administration's U.S. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] (TCJA) overhauled the U.S. tax-code and replicated many of the changes the UK made to their tax-code in 2009–2012 to successfully combat inversions (see below).&lt;ref name="uktax1Quote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inversion perversion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21608751-restricting-companies-moving-abroad-no-substitute-corporate-tax-reform-how-stop|title=How to stop the inversion perversion|work=[[The Economist]]|date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the TCJA moved the U.S to a hybrid–"territorial tax" system,{{efn|name="hybrid"|The TCJA's GILTI tax regime, which acts like an international [[alternative minimum tax]] for IP–heavy U.S. multinationals, has led some to qualify the new U.S. TCJA system as a hybrid–"territorial" system.&lt;ref name="tf1"/&gt;}} reduced the headline rate from 35% to 21% and introduced a new GILTI–FDII–BEAT regime designed to remove incentives for U.S. multinationals to execute corporate tax inversions to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://taxfoundation.org/inversions-new-tax-law/|title=Inversions under the new TCJA tax law|publisher=Tax Foundation|author=Kyle Pomerleau|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://taxfoundation.org/treatment-foreign-profits-tax-cuts-jobs-act/|title=A Hybrid Approach: The Treatment of Foreign Profits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|author=Kyle Pomerleau|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | November 2018}}, there have been no further U.S. corporate tax inversions to Ireland since the 2016–2017 rule changes by the Obama, and the Trump administrations.

Apple's Q1 2015 [[leprechaun economics]] re-structure of their Irish BEPS tool, is considered by some economists to be a quasi–inversion.&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brads"/&gt;  Whereas Apple did not relocate its corporate headquarters to Ireland like Pfizer tried to do with Allergan, Apple was able to use the [[CAIA arrangement|CAIA BEPS]] tool to legally re-locate $300 billion of IP, equivalent to all of Apple's non–U.S. business, to Ireland.  While the Obama administration blocked the proposed $160 billion Pfizer–Allergan tax inversion to Ireland in 2016 (see above), Apple completed a much larger transaction in Q1 2015, that remained unknown until January 2018.&lt;ref name="cof2"/&gt;  In July 2018, the Irish ''[[Sunday Business Post]]'' reported that Microsoft was planning a similar IP–based quasi–inversion to Ireland, as Apple executed in 2015.&lt;ref name="em"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.businesspost.ie/news/irish-microsoft-firm-worth-100bn-ahead-merger-419721|title=Irish Microsoft firm worth $100bn ahead of merger|publisher=[[The Sunday Business Post]]|author=Ian Guider|date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK inversions===

Ireland's largest law firm, ''Authur Cox'',{{efn|name="law"}} records the move of ''[[Experian plc]]'' to Ireland in 2006, as the first UK corporate tax inversion to Ireland.&lt;ref name="arthurcox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurcox.com/practice_area/corporate-and-ma/inversions-corporate-migrations-demergers-spin-offs/|title=Inversions, Corporate Migrations and Demergers/Spin-Offs|publisher=Authur Cox|access-date=18 November 2018|quote=We are always innovating and coming up with new ways for our clients to achieve their commercial objectives. In the last number of years we have advised on: [...] the first UK inversion to Ireland (Experian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experian was formed in 2006 from the de-merger of UK conglomerate GUS plc, but most of Experian's business was U.S. based (e.g. it had a limited connection to the UK).&lt;ref name="experian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2944305/Ireland-has-the-edge-says-expansive-GUS.html|title=Ireland has the edge, says expansive GUS|date=26 July 2006|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Melanie Feisst|quote=GUS's demerger document reveals Experian's corporate HQ will be in Dublin, its holding company incorporated in Jersey and that it will be tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2009, several UK multinationals "re-domiciled" to Ireland: [[WPP plc]], [[United Busines Media plc]], [[Henderson Group plc]], [[Shire plc]] and [[Charter International|Charter (Engineering) plc]].&lt;ref name="uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-uk-reversed-tide-corporate-tax-inversions/#_ftn4|title=Tax Reform in the UK Reversed the Tide of Corporate Tax Inversions|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|author=William McBride|date=14 October 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the U.S. tax-code, the UK tax-code did not require the inversion to be executed by way of an acquisition of an Irish–based corporate who was at least 20% of the merged group.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;  However, in 2009, the UK Labour government switched to a "territorial tax" system, and over 2009 to 2012, the UK Conservative government introduced a number of other corporate tax reforms including reduction of the UK headline CT rate to 20%, creation of new BEPS tools (e.g. a ''[[patent box]]''), and re-structure of "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC) rules.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uktax1Quote"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://taxfoundation.org/united-kingdom-s-experience-inversions/|title=The United Kingdom's Experience with Inversions|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=5 April 2016|access-date=2018-11-15|author=Kyle Pomerleau|quote=The solution that they came up with was to move to a territorial tax system.

The UK corporate tax reforms not only reversed many of Irish tax inversions but in 2014, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that "In U.S. tax inversion Deals, U.K. is now a winner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-inversion-tax-deals-u-k-is-a-winner-1406551914|title=In U.S. tax inversion Deals, U.K. is now a winner|author=Tom Fairless|author2=Shayndi Raice|quote="Right now, it's safe to say that the U.K. is the preferred country of destination for inverted companies, given the favourable tax regime and the non-tax attractions of the U.K.," said Mr. Willens, a former managing director at Lehman Brothers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|November 2018}}, the UK had received the 3rd–largest number of U.S. corporate tax inversions in history, only ranking behind Ireland and Bermuda in popularity (see above).

{{As of | November 2018}}, there have been no further UK corporate tax inversions to Ireland since the 2009–2012 rule changes by the Labour, and the Conservative governments.

===Other inversions===

Ireland's largest law firm, ''Authur Cox'',{{efn|name="law"}} records the move of ''[[Pentair]]'' to Ireland in 2014, as the first Swiss corporate tax inversion to Ireland.&lt;ref name="arthurcox"/&gt;  However, Pentair was a U.S.–controlled firm that had previously inverted to Switzerland, and moved to Ireland (without a corporate acquisition), in 2014 to make it more attractive to a larger U.S. corporate tax inversion, which [[Emerson Electric]] attempted in 2016, however the change in the U.S. tax-code (see above), meant that Emmerson decided to abandon the inversion, and instead purchased a division of called ''Pentair Valves'' for $3.15 billion; the renaming Pentair group re-domiciled to the UK in 2018.&lt;ref name="pentair"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irishtimes.com/business/manufacturing/irish-based-industrial-firm-pentair-in-3-15bn-deal-1.2761694|title=Irish-based industrial firm Pentair in $3.15bn deal|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Joe Breannan|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | November 2018}}, outside of U.S. and UK inversions to Ireland, there have been no other recorded corporate tax inversions to Ireland from other jurisdictions.

==Corporate tax haven==

===Ireland as a tax haven===
{{main article|Ireland as a tax haven|Tax haven#Tax haven lists}}

Ireland is labelled a both a [[corporate tax haven]], due to its BEPS tools (e.g. Double Irish, Single Malt and CAIA), and a traditional [[tax haven]], due to [[QIAIF]]s.  The topic is covered in more detail in [[Ireland as a tax haven]], however, the main facts regarding Ireland's [[corporate tax haven]] status are:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|Ireland is noted as a tax haven on all academic tax haven lists (Hines 1994 2007 2010, Dharmapala 2006 2010, and [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman]] 2015 2018), all main non-governmental tax haven lists ([[Tax Justice Network]], [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy|ITEP]], [[Oxfam]]), and several U.S. Congressional (2008 2015) and Senate (2013) investigations;
|As well as appearing on all established [[Corporate haven#Corporate tax haven lists|Corporate tax haven lists]], Ireland also ranks prominently on all "[[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|proxy tests]]" including [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|distorted GDP-per-capita]];
|Noted tax haven academic [[Gabriel Zucman]] (et alia) estimated in June 2018 that Ireland is the largest global [[corporate tax haven]], and larger than the aggregate Caribbean tax haven system, and that Ireland's aggregate effective tax rate on foreign corporates is 4%;&lt;ref name="gbz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/missingprofits/|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|quote=Appendix Table 2: Tax Havens|page=31|author1=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|author2=Thomas Torslov|author3=Ludvig Wier|publisher=University of Berkley|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=Such profit shifting leads to a total annual revenue loss of $200 billion globally|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zux"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=New Gabriel Zucman study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Mark Paul|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|CORPNET (University of Amsterdam) identify Ireland as one of the five leading global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFCs]] who are at the nexus of corporate tax avoidance, and who traditional tax havens (e.g. Caribbean tax havens) increasingly rely on to source corporate tax avoidance flows;&lt;ref name="xx1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Javier Garcia-Bernardo|author2=Jan Fichtner|author3=Frank W.

|Tax haven investigators identify Ireland as showing signs of behaving like a '''[[Ireland as a tax haven#Captured state|captured state]]''' willing to foster and protect tax avoidance strategies, and using complex data protection and privacy laws (e.g. no public [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] accounts) to function as a tax haven while still maintaining OECD-compliance and transparency;
}}

Ireland does not appear on the 2017 [[Ireland as a tax haven#OECD 1998 definition|OECD list of tax havens]]; only Trinidad and Tobago is on the 2017 OECD list, and no OECD member has ever been listed.  Ireland does not appear on the 2017 [[Ireland as a tax haven#EU tax haven lists|EU list of 17 tax havens]], or the EU's list of 47 "greylist" tax havens; again, no EU-28 country has ever been listed by the EU.

During 2009–2012, both the Labour Government and the Conservative Government, overhauled the UK corporate tax code, switching from a "worldwide tax" system to a "territorial tax" system.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt; By 2014, the UK ''[[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]]'' reported most of the UK firms that inverted to Ireland had returned to the UK (e.g., WPP plc, United Business Media plc, Henderson plc), or were about to be acquired by U.S. multinationals as part of a U.S. tax inversion (e.g. Shire plc{{efn|name="shire"}}).&lt;ref name="HMRC"/&gt;  

{{As of |November 2018}}, since the UK overhauled its tax code, there have been no inversions of UK firms to Ireland; of the 3 main UK–controlled firms in Ireland (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''):

* [[Shire plc]] – the UK pharmaceutical inverted to Ireland in 2009, but did not return to the UK post the 2009–2012 UK tax reforms due to acquisition interest by U.S. pharmaceutical firms attempting to use Shire plc to execute a U.S. tax inversion to Ireland; however, the Obama administration's changes to the U.S. tax code in 2016 stopped further U.S. interest in Shire plc, and in 2018, it accepted a lower bid from Japanese pharmaceutical multinational [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], who will not be using Shire plc to invert to Ireland.{{efn|name="shire"}}
* [[Experian plc]] – the first UK corporate tax inversion to Ireland in 2016, however almost all of Experian's business is U.S.–based, so it is unlikely to return to the UK.{{efn|name="experian"|Ireland's largest law firm, ''Authur Cox'', records the move of ''[[Experian plc]]'' to Ireland in 2006, as the first UK corporate tax inversion to Ireland.&lt;ref name="arthurcox"/&gt;  Experian was formed in 2006 from the de-merger of UK conglomerate GUS plc, but most of Experian's business was U.S. based (e.g it had a limited remaining connection to the UK).&lt;ref name="experian"/&gt;}}

In April 2018, the EU Commission's [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] rules forced Facebook to move 1.5 billion of the 1.9 billion Facebook accounts hosted in Ireland ( 79% of the 2.4 billion total global Facebook accounts), back to the U.S.&lt;ref name="fbk9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/facebook-to-put-1-5bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-eu-gdpr-privacy-law-1.3466837|title=Facebook to put 1.5bn users out of reach of new EU GDPR privacy law| publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The April 2018 Irish High Court ruling in the [[Max Schrems]] EU data-protection case could make Ireland even less attractive to Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/sh2/PA-ref.pdf|title=Irish High Court sends Facebook’s EU-US data transfers before CJEU|publisher=[[Max Schrems]]| date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====US countermeasures (2016–2018)====
{{see also|Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act}}

The U.S. has had a contradictory approach to Ireland's CT system.  U.S. investigations, from the first U.S. IRS study in 1981,{{efn|name="gordon1"}}&lt;ref name="gordon2"/&gt; up to and including 2013 U.S. McCain–Levin Senate investigations into Apple's tax structures, label Ireland as a "tax haven" for U.S. multinationals.&lt;ref name="psi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psi3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holygrail"/&gt;  However, it was the EU and not the U.S., that forced Ireland to close its Double Irish BEPS tool in 2015.&lt;ref name="roy1"/&gt;  While the Obama administration supported the McCain–Levin findings on Apple, it came to Apple's defense in 2016 when the EU Commission fined Apple €13 billion for taxes avoided over 2004–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. accuses EU of grabbing tax revenues with Apple decision|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-taxavoidance-usa-idUSKCN1161UC|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contradiction is chronicled in "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Political compromises|political compromises]]".  The source of the contradiction is ascribed to the findings of U.S. tax academic, [[James R. Hines Jr.]]; Hines is the most cited author on tax haven research, and his important [[James R. Hines Jr.#Tax haven research|1994 Hines–Rice paper]] was one of the first to use the term'' "[[BEPS|profit shifting]]"''.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt; The 1994 Hines–Rice paper showed that ''low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8b8cb98-c956-11de-b551-00144feabdc0|title=Tax havens benefits spelt out|publisher=[[The Financial Times]]|date=4 November 2009|quote=The study said "a large body of economic research over the last 15 years" contradicted the popular view that offshore centres erode tax collections, divert economic activity and otherwise burden nearby high-tax countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hines' insight that the [[Tax haven#U.S. as the largest beneficiary|U.S. is the largest beneficiary from tax havens]] was confirmed by others,&lt;ref name="dryng"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00346.x|title=Using Financial Accounting Data to Examine the Effect of Foreign Operations Located in Tax Havens and Other Countries on U.S. Multinational Firms' Tax Rates|author1=Scott Dyreng|author2=Bradley P.

This result suggests that in some cases, tax haven operations may increase U.S. tax collections at the expense of foreign country tax collections.|journal=[[Journal of Accounting Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dictated U.S. policy towards tax havens, including the 1996 "[[Entity classification election|check-the-box]]"{{efn|name="check"|Before 1996, the United States, like other high-income countries, had anti-avoidance rules—known as “controlled foreign corporations” provisions—designed to immediately tax in the United States some foreign income (such as royalties and interest) conducive of profit shifting.

This move is called “checking the box” because that is all

However, by 2014 Ireland had become the leading destination for U.S. [[#Corporate tax inversions|corporate tax inversions]], and in 2016, the Obama administration decided to move against Ireland's CT system by amending the U.S. tax-code to block the proposed $160 billion Pfizer–Allergan Irish corporate tax inversion, which would have been the largest tax inversion in history.

The most serious threat to Ireland's CT system, and Ireland's economic model came in December 2017 with the passing of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] (TCJA) by the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/12/breaking-down-the-new-u-s-corporate-tax-law|title=Breaking Down the New U.S. Corporate Tax Law|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|author=[[Mihir A.

===Sustainability of system===

The above post–2009 UK, EU and U.S. countermeasures against Ireland's corporate tax system, and by extension Ireland's economic model, have been a cause of concern in Ireland, and even the "architect" of Ireland's BEPS tools, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner, [[Feargal O'Rourke]], has warned on the sustainability of Irish CT revenues.&lt;ref name="fearg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/frothiness-of-corporate-tax-revenues-risk-to-economy-says-pwc-chief-1.3471704|title=‘Frothiness’ of corporate tax revenues risk to economy, says PwC chief|date=24 April 2018|publisher=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Irish Government publilshed a study on the sustainability of its corporate tax system by [[University College Cork]] economist Seamus Coffey.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;  Coffey reported that Irish CT revenues were sustainable to 2020,&lt;ref name="seas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/strong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fstrong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290|title=Strong corporate tax receipts ‘sustainable’ until 2020| publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=12 September 2017|author=Eoin Burke-Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but caveated that given the concentration of CT revenues to a handful of U.S. multinationals, a shock to Ireland's CT revenues is "inevitalbe".&lt;ref name="cf1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ireland-in-line-for-shock-over-business-tax-q9zpc2d3b|title=Ireland in line for shock over business tax|date=17 May 2018|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|author=Peter O'Dwyer|quote=Ireland is putting “all its eggs in one basket” through its growing reliance on international multinationals, and a shock to corporation tax receipts is unavoidable, a leading economist has warned.

In Q2 2018, an IMF country report on Ireland, while noting the significant exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. corporates, concluded that the TCJA may not be as effective as Washington expects in countering Ireland as a U.S. corporate tax haven. In writing its report, the IMF conducted confidential anonymous interviews with Irish corporate tax experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2018/cr18195.ashx|title=IRELAND SELECTED ISSUES Section E: The U.S. Tax Reform|pages=27–33|publisher=IMF|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in June 2018, the former IMF mission-chief for Ireland [[Ashoka Mody]], who oversaw Ireland's bailout during the 2009–22012 Irish financial crisis, warned that in relation to TCJA:

[[File:Irish Corporation Tax Rates (1974 to 2016).png|thumb|Irish corporate tax rates (1974 to 2016). Source: [[Revenue Commissioners|Revenue]].&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;]]
The following are the historical rates of Irish corporation tax since 1994.&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;

A '''special rate''' of 10% for companies in manufacturing (and the [[Shannon Free Zone]]), was introduced in 1980–81 (with EU State-aid approval), and extended to the financial services in the [[International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC) zone in 1987 (with EU State-aid approval); due to EU decision to withdraw EU State-aid approval in 1996–1998,&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt; the special rate was phased-out and ended on 31 December 2003 for new schemes, with expiry for all existing IFSC schemes in 2005, and all existing manufacturing schemes by 2010.  To counter the EU's decision to withdraw State-aid approval for Ireland's special rate,  the Irish State reduced the Irish ''standard rate'' of corporation tax from 40% in 1995, to 12.5% by 2003; splitting the standard rate into trading and non-trading rates in 2000.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120125054/http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/incentives/tax-incentives-investors-ireland.html | title=10% rate of Corporation Tax for Manufacturing Enterprises | publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]] | access-date=17 November 2018 | quote=A 10% rate of corporation tax is applied to income from the sale of goods manufactured by a company in the State. These include both goods which are normally considered manufactured, and also goods and services specifically designated by the legislation as qualifying for the relief (especially computer services).  A general 12.5% rate for trading profits will apply from 1 January 2003. Existing operations which are eligible for the 10% rate will retain entitlement to this rate until the end of the year 2010 in the case of manufacturing.  New projects established after 22 July 1998 in manufacturing will be eligible for the 10% rate in respect of their activities until 31 December 2002, after which they will then be subject to the 12.5% rate. A maximum of 77 IDA grant-aided projects per year will qualify.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;

==History of system==

Ireland's corporate tax code has gone through distinct phases of development, from building a separate dentify from the British system, to most distinctively, post the creation of the Irish [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") in 1987, becoming a "low tax" knowlegdge based (i.e. focus intgangible assets) multinational economy.&lt;ref name="eandy"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/EY_Historical_Dev_International_Context_Irish_%20Corporation_Tax.pdf|title= The historical development and international context of the Irish corporate tax system (Ernst &amp; Young).|publisher=Department of Finance|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has not been without controversy and complaint from both Ireland's EU partners,&lt;ref name="aa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-corporate-tax-rate-davos-stealing-3817678-Jan2018/| title='That's a joke', 'stealing': Ireland's low corporate tax rate criticised at Davos| publisher=thejournal.ie|date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/several-of-ireland-s-top-companies-pay-as-little-as-1-in-tax-1.3238360?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fseveral-of-ireland-s-top-companies-pay-as-little-as-1-in-tax-1.3238360| title=Several of Ireland’s top companies pay as little as 1% in tax| publisher=Irish Times|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/luxembourg-blasts-rate-of-corporation-tax-in-ireland-467927.html| title=Luxembourg PM blasts Ireland's low corporate tax Rate| publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also from the US (whose multinationals, for specific reasons, comprise almost all of the major foreign multinationals in Ireland).&lt;ref name="aa4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/joseph-stiglitz-cheating-ireland-muddled-europe-1.2776981?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fjoseph-stiglitz-cheating-ireland-muddled-europe-1.2776981| title=Joseph Stiglitz: ‘Cheating’ Ireland, muddled Europe|publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence under Cumann na nGaedheal===
It was only with the acceptance of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] by both the [[Dáil]] and [[British House of Commons]] in 1922 that the mechanisms of a truly independent state begin to emerge in the [[Irish Free State]]. In keeping with many other decisions of the newly independent state the [[Irish Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and later the Free State government continued with the same practices and policies of the iriash administration with regard to corporate taxation.

This continuation meant that the British system of "corporate profits taxation" ("CPT") in addition to [[income tax]] on the profits of firms was kept. The CPT was a relatively new innovation in the United Kingdom and had only been introduced in the years after [[World War I]], and was widely believed at the time to have been a temporary measure. However, the system of firms being taxed firstly through income taxed and then through the CPT was to remain until the late seventies and the introduction of Corporation Tax, which combined the income and corporation profits tax in one.

During the years of [[W. T. Cosgrave]]'s governments, the principal aim with regard to fiscal policy was to reduce expenditure and follow that with similar reductions in taxation. This policy of tax reduction did not extend to the rate of the CPT, but companies did benefit from two particular measures of the Cosgrave government. Firstly, and probably the achievement of which the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] administration was most proud, was the reduction by 50% in the rate of income tax from 6 shillings in the pound to 3 shillings. While this measure benefited all income earners, be they private individuals or incorporated companies, a number of adjustments in the Finance Acts, culminating in 1928, increased the allowance on which firms were not subject to taxation under the CPT. This allowance was increased from £500, the rate at the time of independence, to £10,000 in 1928. This measure was in part to compensate Irish firms for the continuation of the CPT after it has been abolished in the United Kingdom.

A measure which marked the last years of the Cumann na nGaedheal government, and one that was out of kilter with their general free trade policy, but which came primarily as a result of [[Fianna Fáil]] pressure over the 'protection' of Irish industry, was the introduction of a higher rate of CPT for foreign firms. This measure survived until 1948, when the [[Government of the 13th Dáil|Inter-Party government]] rescinded it, as many countries with which the government was attempting to come to double taxation treaties viewed it as discriminatory.

===Fianna Fáil under Éamon de Valera===

The near twenty years of Fianna Fáíl government between from 1931 to 1948, cannot be said to have been a time where much effort was expended on changing or analysing the taxation system of corporations. Indeed, only one policy sticks out during those year of Fianna Fáil rule; being the continued reduction in the level of the allowance on which firms were to be exempt from taxation under the CPT, from £10,000 when Cumman na nGaehael left office, to £5,000 in 1932 and finally to £2,500 in 1941. The impact of this can be seen in the increasing importance of CPT as a percentage of government revenue, rising from and less than 1% of tax revenue in the first decade of the Free State to 3.64% in the decade 1942–43 to 1951–52. This increase in revenue from the CPT was due to more firms being in the tax net, as well as the reduction in allowances. The increased tax net can be seen from the fact that between 1932–33 and 1938–39, the number of firms paying CPT increased by over 33%. One other aspect of the Fianna Fáil government which bears all the fingerprints of [[Seán Lemass]], was the 1946 decision to allow mining companies to write off all capital expenditure against tax over five years.

===Seán Lemass and an Irish tax system===

The period between after the late 1950s and up to the mid-1970s can be viewed as a period of radical change in the evolution of the Irish Corporate Taxations system. The increasing realisation of the government that Ireland would be entering into an age of increasing free trade encouraged a number of reforms of the tax system. By the mid-1970s, a number of amendments, additions and changes had been made to the CPT, these included fifteen-year tax holidays for exporting firms, the decision by the government to allow full depreciation in 1971 and in 1973, and the Section 34 of the Finance Act, which allowed total tax relief in respect of royalties and other income from licenses patented in Ireland.

This period from c.1956 to c.1975, is probably the most influential on the evolution of the Irish corporate tax system and marked the development of an 'Irish' corporate tax system, rather than continuing with a version of the British model.

This period saw the creation of Corporation Tax, which combined the Capital Gains, Income and Corporation Profits Tax that firms previously had to pay. Future changes to the corporate tax system, such as the measures implemented by various governments over the last twenty years can be seen as a continuation of the policies of this period. The introduction in 1981 of the 10% tax on manufacturing was simply the easiest way to adjust to the demands of the EEC to abolish the export relief, which the EEC viewed as discriminatory. With the accession to the EEC, the advantages of this policy became increasingly obvious to both the Irish government and to foreign multi-nationals; by 1982 over 80% of companies who located in Ireland cited the taxation policy as the primary reason they did so.

===Charles Haughey low-tax economy (1987–2009)===
{{related article|International Financial Services Centre#History}}
{{related article|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}
The Irish [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") was created in Dubin in 1987 by Taoiseach [[Charles Haughey]] with an EU approved 10% [[special economic zone]] corporate tax rate for global financial firms within its 11-hectare site.  The creation of the IFSC is often considered the birth of the [[Celtic Tiger]] and the driver of its first phase of growth in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="his3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance-magazine.com/display_article.php?i=2300&amp;pi=142|title=Dermot Desmond on the IFSC past and future|publisher=Finance Dublin|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="his4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance-magazine.com/display_article.php?i=2304&amp;pi=142|title=Milestones of the IFSC|publisher=Finance Dublin|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to EU pressure to phase out the 10% IFSC rate by the end 2005, the overall Irish corporation tax was reduced to 12.5% on trading income, from 32%, effectively turning the entire Irish country into an IFSC.&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt; This gave the second boost to the [[Celtic Tiger]] from 2000 up until the Irish economic crisis in 2009.&lt;ref name="his1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/EY_Historical_Dev_International_Context_Irish_%20Corporation_Tax.pdf | title= History of the Irish Corporate Tax System | publisher=Ernst and Young|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/finance/Report---Global-Corporate-Taxation-Final.pdf | title=Report on Ireland’s Relationship with Global Corporate Taxation Architecture | publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]| date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 Budget (in December 1997) Finance Minister, [[Charlie McCreevy]]&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt; introduced the legislation for a new regime of corporation tax that led to the introduction of the 12.5% rate of corporation tax for trading income from 1 January 2003.  The legislation was contained in section 71 of the Finance Act 1999 and provided for a phased introduction of the 12.5% rate from 32% for the financial year 1998 to 12.5% commencing from 1 January 2003.  A higher rate of corporation tax of 25% was introduced for [[passive income]], income from a foreign trade and some development and mining activities.  Manufacturing relief, effectively a 10% rate of corporation tax, was ended on 31 December 2002.  For companies that were claiming this relief before 23 July 1998, it would still be available until 31 January 2010.  The 10% rate for IFSC activities ended on 31 December 2005 and after this date, these companies moved to the 12.5% rate provided their trade qualified as an Irish trading activity.

The additional passing of the important Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (“TCA”) by [[Charlie McCreevy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/39/enacted/en/html|title=Taxes and Consolidation Act 1997|publisher=Irish Government|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundation for the new vehicles and structures that would become used by IFSC law and accounting firms to help global multinationals use Ireland as a platform to avoid non-US taxes (and even the 12.5% Irish corporate tax rate).  These vehicles would become famous as the [[Double Irish]], [[Double Irish#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]] and the [[Double Irish#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] tax arrangements.  The Act also created the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)| Irish Section 110 SPV]], which would make the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] the largest securitisation location in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-is-top-eurozone-jurisdiction-for-secretive-spvs-36047198.html|title=Ireland is top Eurozone jurisdiction for SPVs|publisher=Irish Independent|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post crisis zero-tax economy (2009–2018)===
{{related article|Leprechaun economics}}

{{related article|EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland}}

The Irish financial crises created unprecedented forces in the Economy.  Irish banks, the largest domestic corporate taxpayers, faced insolvency, while Irish public and private debt-to-GDP metrics approached the highest levels in the OECD.  The Irish Government needed foreign capital to re-balance their overleveraged economy.  Directly, and indirectly, they amended many Irish corporate tax structures from 2009-2015 to effectively make them "zero-tax" structures for foreign multinationals and foreign investors. The US [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] ("BEA") "effective" Irish CT rate, fell to 2.5%.&lt;ref name="ct2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwx"/&gt;

They materially expanded the [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] scheme in the 2009 Finance Act.  This would encourage US multinationals to locate [[intellectual property]] assets in Ireland (as opposed to the Caribbean, as per the [[double Irish]] scheme), which would albeit artificially, raise Irish economic statistics to improve Ireland's "headline" Debt-to-GDP metric.  They also indirectly, allowed US distressed debt funds to use the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Irish Section 110 SPV]] to enable them to avoid Irish taxes on the circa €100bn of domestic Irish assets they bought from NAMA (and other financial institutions) from 2012-2016.

While these [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] schemes were successful in capital, they had downsides.  US multinational tax schemes lead to large distortions in Irish GNI/GNP/GDP statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Apple "onshored" their ASI subsidiary in January 2015, it caused Irish GDP to rise 26.3% in one quarter ("[[leprechaun economics]]").  Foreign multinationals were now 80% of corporate taxes, and concentrated in a smaller group.&lt;ref name="ct1"/&gt;  In response, the Government introduced "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]" (or GNI*) in 2017, which was circa 40% below 2017 Irish GDP, and a paired back of some BEPS schemes to improve corporation tax sustainability.&lt;ref name="coffey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;

Ireland's [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] tax strategy led it to become labelled as one of the top 5 global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|conduit OFCs]], and has come under attack from the US&lt;ref name="aa4"/&gt; and the EU (Apple's largest tax fine in history).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - State aid: Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13 billion|last=|first=|date=30 August 2016|website=europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under pressure from the EU,&lt;ref name="roy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Ireland closed down the [[double Irish]] in 2015, which was described as the largest tax avoidance scheme in history.  However, Ireland replaced it with the new [[Double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|single malt]] system,&lt;ref name="sm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm2"/&gt; and an expanded [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances]] scheme.  More targeted responses have come in the form of the US 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] (esp. FDII and GILTI rates), and the EU's 2018 impending Digital Services Tax.

==Main highlights of his presidency at Telefónica==

In September 2005, he received the Global Spanish Entrepreneur award in New York, by the Spain-US Chamber of Commerce. This distinction is an acknowledgement for his job as president of Telefónica, leading the firm to entry into the Dow Jones Global Titans 50 index. In fact, Telefónica is the first Spanish company -and one of the very few in Europe to be part of that index, made of the world's 50 most successful, global and largest companies.

In April 2008, he was named president of the Social Council of the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/485479/04/08/Economia-Alierta-nuevo-presidente-del-Consejo-Social-de-la-UNED-y-Mrius-Rubiralta-responsable-de-Universidades.html “Economía.- Alierta, nuevo presidente del Consejo Social de la UNED y Màrius Rubiralta responsable de Universidades,”] elEconomista.es (18/04/2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish main open university, with over 100,000 students.

In September 2009 he led one of the main global strategic alliances, putting together Telefónica with Chinese firm China Unicom[1]. Both companies agreed to invest in each other an amount of a billion dollars. The most important part of the cooperation agreement involves research, development and innovation, as well as sharing information on knowledge management and new technologies. This alliance allowed Telefónica to strengthen its position as market leader. It also expanded its client base to over 550 million world-wide, including the clients of its Chinese partner.

In 2009 he was awarded the Tiepolo prize.&lt;ref&gt;http://documenta.elmundo.orbyt.es/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1/ Alierta recibe el Premio Tiepolo (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|it5iPm8h7BI|video del Premio Tiépolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This award is given by the Madrid-Italy Chamber of Commerce and acknowledges the role of Telefónica as one of the leading Spanish global companies.

Also in 2009, the business association Aragón Exterior (Aragonex) acknowledged him as one of the main Aragonese businessmen with a global reach.

In June 2010, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Council of the Americas in New York, for his contribution to the growth and development in Latin America. He was the first Spaniard, and the first non-American citizen, to be awarded by the institution. The award is presented to those who work for the progress and advancement of the continent &lt;ref&gt;http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-economia-empresas-alierta-telefonica-primer-espanol-galardonado-medalla-oro-americas-society-20100610073036.html Alierta (Telefónica), primer español galardonado con la medalla de oro de la Americas Society&lt;/ref&gt; (source: Europa Press)&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|l1_ssnRfLQ0|Alierta galardonado con la medalla de oro de la Americas Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; (source:EFE)

He became, as well, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and member of the Nomination Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expansion.com/2010/09/27/empresas/1285602570.html?a=0353ae0c3c88b0de154da1c9dc016be9&amp;t=1285673358/Alierta "Alierta estará en el consejo de la empresa resultante de la fusión entre Iberia y BA,"] Expansión.com (28/09/2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 the German Chamber of Commerce for Spain awarded César Alierta with the Hispanic-German Prize to Business Excellence, for having succeeded in placing the company among the world's telecommunication industry leaders, with a very prominent presence in Germany through O2, a subsidiary of Telefonica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premioshispanoalemanes.es/es/ Winners of the IV Hispanic-German Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2012, Alierta was awarded the Heraldo Price 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticiasbancarias.com/general/17/09/2012/cesar-alierta-recibe-premio-heraldo-2012/23674.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, César Alierta was awarded the Excellence of Business Management by the IX Aragon's Business Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticiasbancarias.com/general/23/11/2012/cesar-alierta-recibe-premio-a-la-excelencia-en-la-gestion-empresarial/27793.html/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2013, Alierta was included among the twelve most prominent Spaniards in 2012 by the Spanish magazine "Tiempo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zaragozaonline.com/201301036103/Cesar-Alierta-entre-los-12-espanoles-mas-destacados-de-2012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217024443/http://www.zaragozaonline.com/201301036103/Cesar-Alierta-entre-los-12-espanoles-mas-destacados-de-2012 |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alierta's vision on Communications==
Declarations to the press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitb.com/videos/noticias/tecnologia/detalle/349899/alierta-telefonica-advierte-buscadores-internet-tendran-pagar/]&lt;/ref&gt; had been very controversial in Spain, as he suggests charging content providers, application developers and even search engines. Textual declarations include: "we do everything and they (developers, content providers, search engines...) only have the algorithms", "we've opened an opportunity for clever people to generate applications using our communication channels... and we are lucky to own millions of customers that can use them. We will charge for that", "Cloud computing means that the intelligence is in the net. And the net is ours".

==Problems with Justice==
According to The Wall Street Journal: "A Spanish court found that César Alierta, chairman of Telefónica SA, enriched himself through insider trading before he joined the telecom company, but it acquitted him on the ground that the statute of limitations had run out".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Catan &amp; Jason Sinclair, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124783933177858101 "Telefónica Chief Gets Mixed Verdict in Trading Case,"] The Wall Street Journal (July 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Answers.com: "The charges stemmed from 1997, when Alierta and his wife had formed an investment company that they later sold to their nephew. The investment company purchased a large number of Tabacalera shares immediately preceding the purchase of Havatampa and the subsequent rise in tobacco prices, both of which led to an increase in the value of Tabacalera shares. In early 1998 the investment company sold these shares at a great profit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/c-sar-alierta-izuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NederlandscheBank.jpg|thumb|Headquarters in [[Amsterdam]]]]

'''De Nederlandsche Bank''' (DNB) is the [[central bank]] of the [[Netherlands]]. It is part of the [[European System of Central Banks]] ([[ESCB]]). De Nederlandsche Bank is a [[public limited company]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: [[naamloze vennootschap]]) whose every day policy is overseen by the Governing Board. Being an NV, DNB has a [[Supervisory board|Supervisory Board]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Raad van Commissarissen). In addition, there is an advisory body called the Bank [[Council]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Bankraad). As a public entity the DNB has a function as both part of the European System of Central Banks ([[European System of Central Banks|ESCB]]) and an independent public body ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: zelfstandig bestuursorgaan).

As a part of the ESCB, DNB is co-responsible for the determination and implementation of the monetary policy for the Euro area, besides being a link in the [[International monetary systems|international payment system]]. As an independent public body, DNB exercises prudential supervision of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-04/europe-s-central-banks-begin-boosting-price-transparency-for-qe|title=Europe's Central Banks Begin Boosting QE Price Transparency|last=toddwhitebloomb|first=Todd White|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 2 May 1998, the European heads of state or government decided that the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would begin on 1 January 1999 with eleven Member States of the European Union (EU), the Netherlands included. As from 1 June 1998, the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank N.V., forms part of the [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB). On the same day, the new Bank Act (of 1998) came into force. Nearly 185 years into its existence, the Nederlandsche Bank has entered a new phase.

==Tasks of De Nederlandsche Bank==
Under the 1998 Bank Act – replacing that of 1948 – the Bank has the following tasks:

* Within the framework of the ESCB, the Bank shall contribute to the definition and implementation of monetary policy within the European Community (EC). The Bank has the objective to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to this objective, the Bank shall support the general economic policy in the EC.
* The Bank shall hold and manage the official foreign reserves, and shall conduct foreign-exchange operations.
* The Bank shall collect statistical data and produce statistics.
* The Bank shall promote the smooth operation of payment systems; it shall take care of the banknote circulation.
* The Bank shall supervise banks, investment institutions and exchange offices.
* The Bank may, subject to permission by Royal Decree, perform other tasks in the public interest. The European Central Bank (ECB) may also ask the Bank to perform extra tasks.

The first two tasks – also known as the ESCB tasks – ensue entirely from the Maastricht Treaty. Decisions in these areas are taken at the European level by the ECB Governing Council, on which the President of the Nederlandsche Bank has a seat. Promoting the smooth operation of payment systems has both a European and a national dimension. The statistical task is also partly ESCB-related and partly a national concern. The DNB is responsible for international macro-economic statistical analysis for countries outside the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Asif|date=2010-07-02|title=Analysis of the Mission Statement of the Commercial Banks of Bangladesh|ssrn=1633225|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two tasks will not be transferred to ESCB level at the start of EMU. Here the Nederlandsche Bank remains fully in control. However, in a Europe where economies are becoming increasingly interlocked, many banking supervisory rules are drawn up at the international level. DNB serves as the banker's bank to general Dutch banks.

One of the government appointed members of the [[Social-Economic Council]] is always a representative of DNB.

The '''downtown core of [[St. Catharines]]''', [[Ontario]], Canada is defined by the city as the area between [[Ontario Highway 406|Highway 406]] on the west and south, Geneva Street on the east until it reaches St. Paul Street then Niagara Street north until it meets Welland Avenue.

It an historical area of the city, as well as a significant cultural and entertainment destination, playing host to several bars and restaurants along St. Paul and James Streets, and the popular Niagara Grape &amp; Wine Festival and Grand Parade in September. Various retail and commercial businesses, are found throughout the core, as well as government, financial and law offices. Since 2015, the neighbourhood is home to the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, a campus of [[Brock University]].

==History==
Intersecting [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] trails, at the confluence of Dick's Creek and 12 Mile Creek, laid the foundation of the [[downtown]] streets as they appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2017/10/27/herod-the-heart-of-st-catharines|accessdate=28 October 2017 |title=Yesterday and Today: The heart of St. Catharines |publisher=St. Catharines Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them remains the largest and most historically significant of the city, St. Paul Street. Construction of the first and second Welland Canals behind St. Paul Street quickly elevated the area into a prosperous hub for commerce and industry in the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]].

==Revitalization==
[[File:St. Catharines courthouse.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Old Courthouse, at the corner of James and King streets]]
Like many downtowns in [[North America]], the area experienced significant decline as [[shopping malls]] and [[Power center (retail)|power centre]]s in the [[suburbs]] took over as major shopping destinations. Citizens of St. Catharines often complained of the lack of parking and inconveniences associated with one-way streets in the core. Today, the downtown is experiencing a modest turnaround thanks to public and private investment in the areas surrounding St. Paul and James Streets, as well as the former Lower Level Parking Lot.

On April 3, 2006, [[St. Catharines City Council]] voted in favour of returning two-way traffic to the downtown core, at an anticipated cost of $2 million. At the time, two-way traffic was promoted as one way of making the downtown streets safer, slowing down traffic and boosting business. By October 2009, most of the conversion work was completed. The addition of two-way traffic, especially to St. Paul Street, played a role in the Ontario Wine Council's decision to modify the [[Niagara Wine Route]] to pass through downtown St. Catharines in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismstcatharines.ca/news/details/wine-route-has-arrived-in-downtown-st-catharines |accessdate=18 June 2014 |title=Wine Route Has Arrived in Downtown St. Catharines |publisher=St. Catharines Economic Development and Tourism Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2006 the Province of Ontario released a Growth Plan under the ''Places to Grow Act, 2005'', of which was born the [[Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://placestogrow.ca/images/pdfs/ggh2017/en/growth%20plan%20%282017%29.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2017 |title=Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe 2017 |publisher=Province of Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the plan, Downtown St. Catharines is identified as one of 22 Urban Growth Centres for the province, given a growth target of 150 residents and jobs combined per hectare by 2031.
[[File:Canada Hair Cloth building St Catharines 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Canada Hair Cloth building, before conversion for university use]]
Since the Places to Grown Act, municipal and regional governments have invested heavily in infrastructure projects in the downtown core. A detailed inspection and analysis of the Burgoyne Bridge in 2010 revealed the need for a new span over [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. Construction on the new signature bridge, which features a steel truss-arch, began in 2014 with an estimated budget of $91.35 million, and was completed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2015/05/07/task-force-created-to-look-into-burgoyne-bridge-replacement |accessdate=7 May 2015 |title=Task Force Created to Look Into Burgoyne Bridge Replacement |publisher=Canoe Sun Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearby Lower Level Parking Lot, construction began in 2013 on the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, a new campus of [[Brock University]]. Completed in 2015, the school operates alongside the [[FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre]], a municipal cultural project, built on adjacent lands.

==Historical sites==
The downtown's extensive history left an impressive showplace of [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] sites in the core. Architectural landmarks reveal the stories behind St. Catharines varying roles as the former seat of Lincoln County, a popular [[destination spa|health-spa]] destination, and the premiere retail centre for Niagara. 
[[File:St. Catharines Ontario Street arch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Architecture on Ontario St.]]
*St. Catharines Armoury - A recognized Federal Heritage building, listed #1991 on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/beefp-fhbro/FHB_Rech_Search_e.asp Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel]] - A national historic site, played an important role during the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] era and frequented by [[Harriet Tubman]], the famed conductor of the [[Underground Railroad]].
*City Hall - Built on the site of the previous [[City Hall]], this building was officially opened in August 1937 at the corner of Church and James Streets. Designed by local architect Robert Macbeth, the structure was originally built to accommodate all city departments, including a police station and jail in the basement. In 1963, the building was extensively renovated, however, most of the significant elements found inside, such as the main entryway, its marble floors, ornate ceiling and wide sweeping staircase, were left intact.
*Farmers' Market - One of the oldest farmers' markets in [[Ontario]], dating back to the early 1860s.  It continues to operate every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, as it did over a century ago. [[File:St. Catharines Montebello Park.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Montebello Park]]
*The Grand Opera House (1877–1998) - With seating for 1200, the facility opened to much fanfare as a centre for musical production on Ontario Street.  Over the years it housed an orchestra and featured numerous concerts and vaudeville shows.  After a fire ravaged the building's facade and most of its interior, there was some public interest in restoring what was left of the auditorium, but the city and some professionals concluded that renovations would be much too costly and the site was levelled. The site is used today as a parking lot.
*The Canada Hair Cloth Company Ltd (1882–2007) - An industrial factory for over a century, the building closed in 2007 and is now home to Brock University's Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts.
*The Russell Hotel - a noted hotel and tavern built in 1843 by Samuel Stinson at the corner of St. Paul and James streets. The building was destroyed by fire and the site currently sits empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2016/07/22/yesterday-and-today-the-russell-hotel|title=YESTERDAY AND TODAY: The Russell Hotel |author=Dennis Gannon |publisher=St. Catharines Standard |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mansion House - Thought to have been constructed in the early 19th century by [[William Hamilton Merritt]], it is the oldest tavern in St. Catharines and the oldest continually licensed bar in [[Canada]].[[File:Welland House Hotel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The former Welland House]]
*[[Montebello Park]] - Designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1887, who went on to create [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]. A commemorative rose garden with over 1,300 bushes in 25 varieties is the city's largest rose collection and features an ornamental fountain. The focal point of the park is a band shell and pavilion built in 1888. The park is designated under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.
*Old Courthouse - Built in 1848-49, the Old [[Courthouse]] was the centre of political, cultural and social life in St. Catharines. Designed by renowned architect [[Kivas Tully]], it was hailed as a great architectural achievement. The existing building soon became too small and an addition was added in 1863-65.  Today, the building is home to Carousel Players, an independent theatre group, and recently underwent an extensive restoration.
*[[Welland House Hotel]] - One of the few surviving symbols of the city's extensive health spa history.  Today the building is home to a student residence and [[CFBU]], [[Brock University]]'s [[campus radio]] station.

===Heritage corridor===

The St. Catharines Economic and Tourism Services department, with support from the [[Ministry of Tourism and Recreation (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Tourism]], launched the Heritage Corridor Project in 2004.  The goal of the project is to draw tourists off the Niagara Wine Route into St. Catharines' downtown and other historically significant areas.

===Transportation===

The downtown core of St. Catharines is served by the [[St. Catharines Transit]] on numerous routes. The central bus terminal is located downtown. The terminal also has charter buses taking you to numerous cities around the region including Welland &amp; Thorold, as well as Greyhound buses towards Toronto.

==Early life==
Bardha was born in the southern village of [[Radanj]] in [[Kolonjë District]], [[Albania]]. Having escaped from the strict Albanian communist regime in 1953, after one of his brothers was jailed for political reasons, he settled in [[Detroit]] and went into the restaurant business. He eventually became the owner of 18 [[McDonald's]] fast-food franchises, which grossed over $25 million a year.&lt;ref name="mcdonalds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=614|title=Golden Arches to Rise in Tiranë|date=29 September 1995|accessdate=5 July 2010|quote=Bardha, the owner of McDonald's restaurants in the Detroit area, wants to see the Golden Arches tower over Tiranë as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2015}} Bardha, with congressman [[William Broomfield]] and others, contributed to the saving of arrested political activist [[Pjeter Ivezaj]] in [[Montenegro]] and was the reason the US threatened Yugoslavias favored nation status if Ivezaj was not released. Congressman Broomfield and Bardha testified before a congressional human rights committee regarding human rights abuses in Serbia against ethnic Albanians. Bardha  has a lifetime as a human rights activist and has met with eight of U.S. Presidents for the Albanian/Kosovo  cause. President [[Nixon]] assured him in his own handwriting after a meeting that he will refuse the [[Northern Epirus|Greek ambitions]] in Albania at any cost. Bardha also met with President [[Bill Clinton]] before the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing]] of [[Serbia]] by [[NATO]] and was assured that [[Kosovo]] will be freed from Serbian oppression.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">The '''Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services''' (Spanish: ''Autoridad Federal de Servicios de Comunicación Audiovisual'', AFSCA) was an agency of the [[government of Argentina]] with the power to regulate television and radio services. It began activities on December 10, 2009, two months after the passage of the [[Law 26,522 of Audiovisual Communications Services]] (Ley de Medios), and replaced the Federal Broadcasting Committee (Comité Federal de Radiodifusión, COMFER).

Its former director was [[Martín Sabbatella]].

==Composition==
The AFSCA was led by a seven-member board, consisting of the following:

*1 president and 1 director named by the [[President of Argentina|president]].
*3 directors nominated by parliamentary committee, each representing one of the top three parliamentary blocs.
*2 directors nominated by the Federal Council for Audiovisual Communication; one of these had to be an academic in the fields of information sciences, communications or journalism from a national university.

==History==
The first predecessor to AFSCA was CONART, the National Radio and Television Commission, which came into being in 1957 under the government of [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]].

===Federal Broadcasting Committee===
The Federal Broadcasting Committee (Comité Federal de Radiodifusión, COMFER) was formed with the National Telecommunications Law (Law 19,798), passed in 1972 during the ''de facto'' presidency of [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]].

When the National Broadcasting Law (Law 22,285) was passed in 1980 during the military government of [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], COMFER retained its status as regulator. From 1980 until 2009, COMFER was run by various managers and directors, each of them named by the president. Law 22,285 specified a governing board consisting of representatives from the army, navy and air force, the secretaries of public information and communications, and representatives of the trade associations for radio and television.

===AFSCA===
AFSCA was formed in 2009 after the passage of Law 26,522. It had the power to award television licenses, regulate programming and sanction violators with fines.

On September 17, 2012, President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] tapped [[Martín Sabbatella]], a former member of the Chamber of Deputies and one-time [[intendant]] of [[Morón, Buenos Aires]], to head up the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Télam|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/38219/|date=2012-09-17|accessdate=2015-05-26|title=El Ejecutivo propuso a Martín Sabbatella como candidato al directorio de la Afsca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114547/http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/38219/|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabbatella took the post on October 1.

In December 2015, new president [[Mauricio Macri]] placed AFSCA under the direction of the Ministry of Communications and combined it with AFTIC, the Federal Authority for Information and Communications Technologies. The combined agency is run by [[Miguel De Godoy]], former secretary for media in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=La Nación|first=José|last=Crettaz|date=2015-12-20|accessdate=2015-12-20|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1855857-el-gobierno-reformula-la-afsca-y-modifica-la-ley-de-medios|title=El Gobierno reformula la Afsca y modifica la ley de medios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillermo Wiese de Osma''' (1927 in [[Paris]] – April 27, 1999 in [[Lima, Peru]]) was a [[Peru]]vian businessman and lawyer. He was the son of Augusto N. Wiese Eslava and Virginia de Osma Porras, who had another 4 children (Clotilde, Silvia, Mary Virginia and Philip Augustus). He was married to Delfina Miró Quesada Cornejo and was the father of 5 daughters (Marina, Virginia, Delphine, Diana and Veronica Wiese Miró Quesada).

==Education and career==
Guillermo Wiese de Osma studied law at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]]. With longstanding ties to banking, in 1952 he took on a job in the prominent Wiese Bank, founded by his father in 1943. He became director the following year, Vice Chairman in 1957 and Chairman in 1971.

Because of his experience, Wiese was appointed Director of the [[Central Reserve Bank of Peru]] between August 1962 and December 1966&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/docs/Publicaciones/Memoria/Memoria-BCRP-1965.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and also the [[Bladex]]. He was also the alternate governor of [[Felaban]] and representative of the [[Association of Banks in the Confiep]].

When the private bank began experiencing difficult times he managed to keep it afloat under private property. He was then named Honorary President of the Board of Wiese Bank, President of Business and Real Estate of Wiese Financial Investments, and Vice president of A &amp; F Wiese and Wiese Representations. He is remembered for his firmness within the Wiese bank for not being driven out by the police who were carrying out [[Alan García|Alan Garcia]]'s mandate for the nationalization of banks.

==Death and legacy==
Wiese died of a painful illness on Tuesday, April 27, 1999 in Lima, where his remains laid in wait at the Church of the Virgen del Pilar, [[San Isidro District, Lima|San Isidro]] and was buried in the Park Cemetery Campo Fe, Huachipa, built on what was the Wiese de Osma and Checa Solari Ranch.

His social work was tied to the city of [[Chișinău]], where he was also a civil servant and merchant. A member of the Moldavian Republic's legislature (''[[Sfatul Țării]]'') in 1918, he returned to prominence during World War II, designated by the antisemitic regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] as President of the Chișinău ''[[Judenrat]]'', effectively answering for the Chișinău Ghetto. He was unable to prevent his constituents' deportation and indiscriminate killing in [[Transnistria Governorate]], but was spared their fate until May 20, 1942. He committed suicide the following day; his wife attempted the same, but was rescued and her life was spared.

==Biography==
Landau was active in [[Bessarabia]], a province of the [[Russian Empire]] to 1917. He became politically prominent in 1918, when Bessarabia became the quasi-independent "Moldavian Democratic Republic", with Chișinău as its capital. Aged 40 at the time, he was integrated into the Republic's civil service,&lt;ref name="chuc157"&gt;[[Charles Upson Clark]], ''Bessarabia. Russia and Roumania on the Black Sea'', p. 157. New York City: [[Dodd, Mead and Company]], 1927.  {{OCLC|1539999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also taking a seat in the ''Sfatul Țării'' legislature. However, he was absent from ''Sfatul'' during the debates of {{OldStyleDateNY|April 9|March 27}}, 1918, at the end of which Bessarabia [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|united with Romania]].&lt;ref name="chuc157"/&gt; Subsequently, Landau integrated into the Jewish and Gentile life of [[Greater Romania]]. A shopkeeper in Chișinău by 1929, he also served on the board of ''Cultura și Munca'' ("Culture and Labor", the ''[[Kehilla (modern)|kehilla]]''), under [[Yehuda Leib Tsirelson]].&lt;ref&gt;"Anunțuri judiciare de interes particular", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', January 30, 1929, p. 944&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]] also note that he was a "popular social activist".&lt;ref name="ie&amp;vs100"&gt;Ehrenburg &amp; Grossman, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, June 1940, almost a year into World War II, the [[Soviet Union]] staged its [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupation of Bessarabia]]. This was received as a shock in Romania, where a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-aligned regime took over, with [[Ion Antonescu]] at its helm. Over the following months, the regime, which inherited and enforced [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] passed in the late 1930s, constructed a conspiracy theory, blaming Jews for the Soviet occupation and for alleged acts of terror.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were immediately disproved by community leaders such as [[Horia Carp]] and [[Wilhelm Filderman]], but, as historian [[Dennis Deletant]] writes, "these details [...] had little impact on the officers and men of the [[Romanian army]] of 1940. The whole anti-Semitic argument rested on a total denial of these facts."&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to Landau's later testimony, his fellow Chișinău Jews, and possibly some of his relatives, were actually deported to the [[Gulag]] under Soviet rule.&lt;ref name="pash59–60"&gt;Shapiro, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 1941, Romania joined in Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|surprise attack on the Soviet Union]], and retook Bessarabia. The Jews of Chișinău were trapped under a military occupation, and had to move into a Ghetto, delineated in the late days of July. On August 1 the Ghetto Committee was created by the Romanians. It had Landau as its president, with Avraham Șapira and E. Bittman assisting him,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; and 19 other intellectuals serving as regular members.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Landau personally obtained that he be allowed to open a bakery and a hospital (the latter of which was staffed by the Army), and negotiated the conditions of forced labor by the Jewish captives. The situation soon deteriorated, with food becoming scarce and some 15&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; or 30&lt;ref name="ie&amp;vs100"/&gt; people dying each day within the Ghetto. The hospital was also dismantled, with the Army taking back its donations for reasons of "military expediency".&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenburg &amp; Grossman, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; By August, Jewish labor squadrons were randomly murdered by the soldiers. In one such incident, Captain Radu Ionescu ordered his machine-gun company to fire randomly at Jewish workers.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 149; Shapiro, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, the authorities began carrying out a plan for the mass deportation of Chișinău Jews into [[Transnistria Governorate]], where other Jews were already being massacred or left to die (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]''). With the other Ghetto leaders, Landau addressed an appeal to [[Constantin Vasiliu]], the [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Gendarmerie]] commander, attesting that his community was loyal to Romania, and had suffered under Soviet rule, while noting that the mass of the designated deportees were frail people.&lt;ref name="pash59–60"/&gt; The letter's minimal request was a postponement of the transports to spring, when the Jews could "more easily adapt" to a new home. As noted by historian Paul A. Shapiro, Landau and the others most likely knew that "death of the deportees" was the desired outcome of Vasiliu's project: "Their appeal for postponement would have made no sense, however, if they had betrayed awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal was bluntly rejected by Vasiliu, while Șapira tried in vain to obtain a postponement from Antonescu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 60, 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, as panic engulfed the Ghetto, Landau also addressed a telegram to Antonescu, asking him "very submissively" to "grant pity on [the Chișinău Jews]".&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 59, 166&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, deportations continued at a steady pace. According to Landau's wife Sara, eighteen of her own relatives were deported on the last train from Chișinău, and did not survive deportation, being either shot of dying from [[typhus]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was intensely petitioned by relatives of the deportees, answering them that he knew nothing "about where they were sent".&lt;ref name="pash102"/&gt;

On October 22, Antonescu gave an order excepting baptized Jews and former ''Sfatul'' deputies from being deported—thereby allowing the Landaus to remain in Chișinău.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 74–75, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian regime revoked that order March 30, 1942, when Antonescu instigated the "cleansing of the terrain". This meant the deportation of the 425 Jews remaining in Bessarabia (257 of whom were in the Ghetto, including paraplegics and mental patients).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having saved 23,800 [[Romanian leu|lei]] for bribes,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; the Landaus could not buy protection. On May 20, as the order came for their evacuation, they decided to commit suicide together by [[morphine]] overdose. A search party team found the couple still breathing, sending them to hospital. Sara was rescued and, interned, narrowly avoided deportation; Guttman died in intensive care, on the morning of May 21.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 85, 125&lt;/ref&gt; His death remains one of many forced suicide cases in the closing Ghetto—9 others are mentioned by name in Ehrenburg and Grossman.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenburg &amp; Grossman, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Landau's presence was tolerated in Chișinău for the next year, as the orders for deportation were no longer enforced, and, in mid-1943, ceased altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|resumption of Soviet control]] in 1944, she gave testimony on the Ghetto's plight and the deaths in her own family to Soviet investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 73, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">'''In-mould labelling''' is the use of paper or plastic [[label]]s during the manufacturing of containers by [[blow molding]], [[injection molding]], or [[thermoforming]] processes. The label serves as the integral part of the final [[Product (business)|product]], which is then delivered as  pre-decorated item.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoff A.|title=Design and Technology of Packaging Decoration for the Consumer Market|publisher=CRC Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-0506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the decoration process with the [[Molding (process)|moulding process]] cuts the total cost, but can increase the manufacturing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Packaging User's Handbook|author=Frank Albert Paine, Institute of Packaging|publisher= Springer|year= 1991|isbn=075140151X|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was first developed by [[Owens-Illinois]] in cooperation with [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] to supply pre-labelled bottles that could be filled on the product filling line. This was first applied to [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] shampoo bottles.&lt;ref name="Giles" /&gt;

==Principles==
In-mould labelling (IML) was initially designed for blow molding, though developments using injection molding or thermoforming with reel-fed systems have increased the efficiency of the labelling process. The original concept involves coating the reverse side of the label with a heat seal layer, followed by a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] material in which heat resistant ink is applied to. A heat resistant coating of [[lacquer]] is then applied.&lt;ref name="Giles" /&gt; This process eliminates the need to flame treat the bottles prior to labelling in order to achieve adequate adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beswick|first=R. Hd|author2=D. J. Dunn|title=Plastics in Packaging: Western Europe and North America|publisher=Rapra Technology|date=2002|isbn=978-1-85957-329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, paper was used as the label substrate to which the heat reactive adhesive was applied.  In more recent times polyolefin substrates have been employed, such as Polyart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polyart.com/en/applications/tags-and-labels/iml-labels|title=IML Labels (in-mold labelling)|accessdate=December 15, 2017|publisher=Polyart}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Arjobex Synthetic Papers. This creates the advantage that scrap polyethylene and polypropylene bottles produced in the molding process can be recycled, without the need for label removal prior to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packageprinting.com/article/synthetic-papers-films-in-mold-label-iml-applications-packaging-bottles-containers-47779/#.WTEam_muiJ4.email|last=Polischuk|first=Tom|title=Be Bold|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=June 5, 2017|publisher=packagePRINTING}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Labelling===
There are several techniques for conducting the in-mould labelling process. [[Vacuum]] and [[compressed air]] can be used to handle the labels, also [[static electricity]] can be used. Electrostatic charging electrodes charge a label while it is being transferred to the moulding machine, so that when the label is placed on the tool and released by the labelling robot, it will wrap itself onto the tool. Most robot systems for placement of labels are not required for specific moulding machines and can be used with up to date presses with fast clamping systems.&lt;ref name="Giles2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoff A.|author2=David R. Bain|title=Technology of Plastics Packaging for the Consumer Market|publisher=CRC Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-0508-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labels may be [[paper]] or a similar material to the moulded product. [[Polypropylene]] or [[polystyrene]] is commonly used as label material, with a thickness of 15 to 40 micrometres. Cavitated label material is also used. This is a sandwich material, having a spongy layer bonded between two very thin solid layers. An advantage of cavitated film is better conformance to small-[[radius]] curves on a product. [[Laminate]]d film can be used to decorate products, yielding high wear-resistance. This type of film has the printed surface protected by a second layer of film, with a thickness of 30 or 40 micrometres. Products using this type of label might include picnic-ware, mouse-mats, or internal automotive components.

==Use==
In-mould labelling is  a popular method of decorating injection molded parts for consumer electronics and for [[plastic bottle]]s. Notebook computer and cellphone manufacturers are adopting IML technology for greater wear resistance than spray painting or pad-printing. IML can provide greater decorating options than other methods. Multi-color screen printed and offset lithography printed graphics are used to produce products with higher quality graphics than available with other decorating methods.  Most applications in this area use second surface graphics. The decoration is printed on the back side of a clear substrate, typically [[polycarbonate]] or [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] 0.125mm to 0.375mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic-labels.com/in-mould-labelling.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041145/http://www.ic-labels.com/in-mould-labelling.html|archivedate=December 2, 2008|title=In Mould Labelling can achieve cost reductions together with outstanding quality of decoration|publisher=IC-labels Ltd. |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection plastic is on the ink side of the film. This encapsulates the decoration between the film layer and the injected plastic resulting in a decoration that can't be abraded during use. Vision systems can check for accurate label positioning, and can validate label correctness.

      <comment>Added newest IOE winner from Get Yer Phil 500</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9797">'''Index of Effluency''' (or IOE) is the top prize awarded in the [[24 Hours of LeMons]] automotive racing series. General criteria to win this award is a car that is too unreliable to be driven effectively on the streets yet manages to complete a decent number of laps on the race track. IOE can be awarded to a vehicle that was deemed unreliable from the factory (e.g. [[Volkswagen]] [[Karmann Ghia]]) or a more reliable car with an unwise engine transplant (e.g. [[Ford Thunderbird (fourth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] with a [[BMW M21|BMW diesel engine]]).

== Prize ==

The Index of Effluency title comes with a trophy. Prior to 2010, the trophy varied in design and was often made from recycled automotive parts. Beginning in 2010, the IOE trophy was made from heavy gauge metal and is of a racer running from an inverted car. The base of the trophy is a steel silhouette of a lemon, the series' logo. Laminated to the base is a printed label of the race name and year.

Along with the fame comes a cash prize, generally paid in the form of a standard, bank issued check written by race organizer John "Jay" Lamm but occasionally paid, as is the winner on laps, in [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickels]]. When local banks do not have enough coins in stock to pay the winner on laps, checks are drawn, but usually on a medium that makes a winner's bank deposit an embarrassing experience (i.e. a toilet seat&lt;ref name="toilet seat checks"&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20100531-LeMons-racers-are-driven-to-grin-9642.ece Dallas Morning News], referenced 2-12-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, IOE winners are frequently spared this layer of ridicule.
[[Image:IoE trophy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|IoE Trophy]]

The amount of the IOE prize has changed over the years.  In 2008 and 2009, the prize was $500.  In 2010, in order to raise the significance of the Index of Effluency over that of winning the race outright (completing the most number of laps), the IOE prize was raised to $1501, one dollar more than the then-current race-winning prize of $1500. As the prize awards for winning the race outright and/or winning different race classes have changed over time, the IOE prize has continued to be set at one dollar more than the next-highest prize amount, to emphasize the IOE's status as the highest award in LeMons.

The '''International Star Registry''' ('''ISR''') is an organization founded in 1979, which sells the right to unofficially name stars. 
Products and services are often marketed as [[gift]]s or [[memorial]]s.

==History==
International Star Registry of Illinois started in 1979 by John and Phyllis Mosele. The company claims to have named about 2 million stars since its formation and published these names in a series of books. It has been organizing their business of naming stars for people for decades. The present owner of the company is Rocky Mosele, one of John and Phyllis Mosele’s twelve children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaching For The Stars|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-28/features/9303185804_1_international-star-registry-star-registry-canadian-operation|accessdate=3 May 2017|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has published nine large volumes of the copyrighted book named ''Your Place in the Cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LC Online Catalog - Item Information (Full Record)|url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=11068&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=1&amp;bibId=953913|website=catalog.loc.gov|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Products and services are often marketed as [[gift]]s or [[memorial]]s. Packages sold by the company include framed and unframed [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s, personalized [[jewelry]], [[plush toy]]s, and [[pet rock]]s identifying "naming" of a [[star]] as described in the book.&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starregistry.com/catalog/|title=Product Catalog|publisher=International Star Registry|accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming services are limited to an entry in the book and carries no scientific or official authenticity according to professional astronomers as well as the company's list of frequently asked questions.&lt;ref name=Bob&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYmvvYSs6Y8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=international+star+registry+toronto#PPA160,M1 Strange Universe: The Weird and Wild Science of Everyday Life--on Earth and Beyond], Bob Berman, [[Times Books]]; 1st edition (January 6, 2004) {{ISBN|0-8050-7328-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;ISR FAQ, [http://www.starregistry.com/faq.cfm FAQ] from ''International Star Registry''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite journal|last = Di Justo|first = Patrick|authorlink  = Patrick Di Justo|title = Buy a Star, But It's Not Yours|journal = [[Wired Magazine]]|url = https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/12/49345|accessdate = 7 October 2009|quote=&lt;br&gt;Robert Naeye, editor of ''[[Mercury (magazine)|Mercury Magazine]]'', a publication of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]], puts it in no uncertain terms:&lt;br&gt;"The star names sold by the [https://starregistry.com/ International Star Registry] are not recognized by any professional astronomical organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plait&gt;{{cite book|title=Bad Astronomy|author=Philip C.

In 1998 the International Star Registry was issued a violation by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs for deceptive advertising for claiming "official" naming rights and have since discontinued this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plait|first1=Phil|title=International Hollywood Star Registry|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/02/18/international_hollywood_star_registry.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=7 March 2017|date=18 February 2012|authorlink=Phil Plait}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1930s to 1960, when he left Cuba to go into [[exile]], Lobo was considered the single most powerful sugar broker in the world.  At the time of the start of the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, Lobo's fortune was estimated at close to $200 million.  His assets then included 14 [[sugar mill]]s, over 30,000 acres of land, a bank, an [[insurance company]], and offices in [[Havana]], [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], and [[Manila]].  

Lobo was born in Venezuela to a father of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Jewish descent and a Catholic mother, and grew up in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. As a young man he studied in the [[United States]].  He subsequently married into an old Cuban aristocratic family, the Montalvo family.  Eventually he inherited his father's trading business and turned it into the world's largest sugar trading firm.  A renowned art connoisseur, Lobo also acquired the largest collection of Napoleonic [[memorabilia]] outside [[France]] (the collection is housed today in Havana in the former home of [[Orestes Ferrara]], at the Museo Napoleonico).  Lobo died in Madrid on January 30th, 1983, and is buried at the [[Almudena Cathedral]] next to [[Spain]]'s [[Palacio Real]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Manuel "Manda" Cadwallader Elizalde Jr.''' (November 8, 1936 - May 2, 1997) was a Filipino businessman. He was most known for claiming to discover a '[[Stone-Age]]' tribe called the [[Tasadays]] which was later exposed as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/tasaday|title=The Stone Age tribe that never was {{!}} 31 years of amnesia|last=Bolando|first=By AJ|website=newslab.philstar.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Elizalde was born in [[Manila]] on November 8, 1936 to [[Manolo Elizalde|Manuel "Manolo" Elizalde Sr.]] and Mary Cadwallader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/13/archives/tribesmens-mentor.html|title=Tribesmen's Mentor|first=|last=|work=The New York Times|date=13 August 1970|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to María del Carmen Marti and the couple had three children, Miguel, Manuel III, María del Carmen ("Mia"). The couple later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/scresolutions/resolutions/2002/january/149567.php|title=[G.R. No. 149567.January 28, 2002] NATAS-YA ENTERPRISES, INC., vs. INTESTATE ESTATE OF ELIZALDE, JR.|first=|last=|work=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|date=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasaday hoax==
In June 1971, Elizalde claimed discovery to a primitive tribe untouched by civilization, who lived in caves and survived by hunting and gathering. The "[[Tasadays]]" were found in a forest in [[South Cotabato]], [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Benjamin|date=2000|title="NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC", PANAMIN AND THE STONE-AGE TRIBE|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=77–88|jstor=29790625}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained traction in international media, some complimenting him as "a visionary idealist who cared more about the hard-pressed national minorities than about his family fortune".  However, all visits from foreign media and scholars were supervised by the [[PANAMIN|Presidential Assistance on National Minorities (PANAMIN)]] which was led by Elizalde himself. Independent anthropologists were prohibited to enter the Tasaday reservation area, thus at the time there was no scholarly paper published on the Tasaday. It was only after the Marcos downfall that a Swiss journalist, Oswald Iten, entered the area and found the so-called Paleolithic tribe dressed in T-shirts and living in huts. Many other local and foreign anthropologists decried Elizalde's claims, calling it an elaborate hoax.

==Other controversies==
Elizalde was regarded as a [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|crony]] of former President and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Ricardo.|first=Manapat,|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=9719128704|location=New York|oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his brother Fred J. Elizalde became involved in many businesses such as mining, abaca farming, sugar centrals, tin plate manufacturing, paints, foods, distillery, real estate, rural banking, and agri-business. They both came into conflict with many of his laborers due to exploitation of sugar workers, refusing to pay livable wages and bonuses, and oppression of cultural minorities. Elizalde was the chief executive of several steel companies, which were favored and accommodated by the Marcos regime in funding, and guarantee of lucrative markets. He monopolized sales of tin plates, and raised prices at will, which rippled in the market with price increases. In one instance, Elizalde raised the price for tin plates by 17% in 1980, and threatened to increase it with another 7.5% unless the government continued to charge tax on imported raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Ricardo.|first=Manapat,|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=9719128704|location=New York|oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Elizalde died on May 3, 1997. His family did not disclose the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/08/world/manuel-elizalde-60-dies-defender-of-primitive-tribe.html|title=Manuel Elizalde, 60, Dies; Defender of Primitive Tribe|last=Jr|first=Robert McG Thomas|date=1997-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Águila SA''''', (''El Águila'' for short{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}), called in English the '''Mexican Eagle Oil Company''' or '''Mexican Eagle Petroleum Corporation''', was a Mexican oil company in the 20th century.

==History==
[[File:1st Viscount Cowdray.jpg|thumb|Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray]]
Sir [[Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray|Weetman Pearson]], [[Baronet|Bart.]] ([[Viscount Cowdray]] from 1910) founded the company in 1909 to develop his investments in the [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican oil fields]].

Pearson's interests in Mexico had begun in 1889 when he won a contract from the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] for his civil engineering company, S. Pearson and Sons Ltd, to build the Gran Canal in [[Mexico City]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|pp=6, 7}} This was followed by contracts in 1895 to build a [[Veracruz, Veracruz#The port|harbour at Veracruz]] and in 1896 to build the [[Ferrocarril Transistmico|Tehuantepec Railway]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} Pearson diversified into mining, landholding, transport and electrical utilities around Veracruz.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} He and the engineer [[Frederick Stark Pearson|F.S. Pearson]] (no relation) founded the Mexico Power and Light Company, which provided Mexico City's first public electricity supply.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}} Pearson's businesses and government contracts put him in a favourable position with members of the Díaz dictatorship.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=8}}

Oil production in Mexico was begun in 1901 by a US oil investor, [[Henry Clay Pierce]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=11}} He was quickly followed by a rival, [[Edward L. Doheny]], in the same year.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=11}} Pearson's land surveys in the vicinities of Pedregal and San Cristóbal for the route of the Tehuantepec Railway had reported oil seepage from the ground, so in April 1901 he ordered his manager in Mexico to secure prospecting options on ''"...all land for miles around"''.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=12}} Pearson built a refinery, pipelines and port facilities to handle the oil in 1905–06, but his company didn't make a major oil strike until 1908.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=13}} In the same year one of Pearson's oil strikes caught fire and burned out of control for eight weeks, destroying the entire [[oil field]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=13}}

In 1909 Pearson founded the ''Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila SA'' ("Mexican Eagle Oil Company") in Mexico to take over S. Pearson and Sons' oil interests.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=15}} This followed Pearson's creation of Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd. in the UK in 1908 to manage all of S. Pearson and Sons' investments outside the oil industry.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=16}} Pearson's prospecting continued without success until 27 December 1910, when a well on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast between Veracruz and [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]] struck oil that flowed at a rate of 100,000 [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels]] per day.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}} This single well turned the fortunes of Pearson's oil business. Within a few years he was one of Mexico's two major oil magnates, the other being Doheny.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}} Other oil companies from the USA and Europe had entered the Mexican oil industry but Doheny and Pearson's companies remained pre-eminent until after the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}}

In 1911 the [[Mexican revolution]] overthrew the Díaz dictatorship that had favoured Pearson, ending the civil engineering contracts for which he had first become involved in Mexico.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=25}} However, Pearson had exclusive rights to prospect for oil in several Mexican states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Thayer |title=The Petroleum Industry of Mexico |publisher=[[San José State University]] |url= http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/pemex1.htm |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1914 the company {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}} of prospecting rights, {{convert|175|mi|abbr=off}} of pipeline, two refineries (the second being newly built at Tampico) and storage for seven million barrels of oil.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=14}}

By June 1913 Mexican Eagle was the largest company in the Pearson group, with net assets valued at £6.8 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} However, in December 1918 Pearson claimed in a letter to the UK [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]], that Mexican Eagle was worth £8 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} Mexican Eagle was the largest contributor to the Pearson group's valuation in 1913 of £17 million, which made it the seventh largest business in the UK and among the 30 largest businesses in the World.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=19}} By 1919 the Pearson group was worth £29.6 million, of which in June of that year Mexican Eagle made up £13.4 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=19}} To what extent this represents a growth in value must be considered against the degree of inflation that took place in the First World War.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=20}} However, in 1919 the Pearson group's share value was £79.1 million, of which Mexican Eagle made up £62.6 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=22}} This made Mexican Eagle roughly the equal of [[Burmah Oil]] and far bigger than the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] or Shell Transport and Trading.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=23}}

In 1911 Pearson declined an offer from the [[Texaco|Texas Oil Company]] offered to buy his oil interests.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} In 1912 and 1913 he declined buyout bids from [[Royal Dutch Shell]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} and in 1913 and 1916 he declined bids from [[Esso|Standard Oil of New Jersey]].{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} By 1916 Pearson was keen to sell, but the UK Government persuaded him for strategic reasons not to do so.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} Pearson asked the UK Government to buy 50% of his oil interests, but it responded in 1917 by imposing restrictions that prevented him from transferring ownership as long as the war continued.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}} The [[Constitution of Mexico]] adopted in 1917 nationalised oil deposits.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=26}}

In October 1918, a month before the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] started negotiations with Pearson for Royal Dutch Shell to buy Mexican Eagle.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=1}} On April 2, 1919{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=1}} the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company&lt;!-- The quotes around "Shell" were in the UK parent's legal name; DO NOT remove them. --&gt; jointly bought Mexican Eagle for [[United States dollar|US$]]75 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/15/97086178.pdf |title= $75,000,000 Oil Deal. Royal Dutch and Shell Companies Buy Mexican Eagle Stock |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=1919-03-15 |accessdate=}}''Though the reference says "Shell Oil Company", now the name of [[Shell Oil Company|Royal Dutch Shell's U.S. subsidiary]], it also says the price was split 60% Royal Dutch/40% Shell, the exact split of the 1907-2005 Royal Dutch – "Shell" Transport joint venture (and their 2005 merger). Thus the 40% buyer must have been "Shell" Transport, not Shell Oil Company.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican Eagle was the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until March 18, 1938, when the government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] nationalized it, along with all other foreign-owned oil interests, to create ''Petróleos Mexicanos'' ([[Pemex]]).

''El Aguila'' formally dissolved itself on May 24, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Paul P. |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20715FE3958137A93C7AB178ED85F478685F9 |title= Big Oil Company Closes Its Books; El Aguila of Mexico Holders Vote to Dissolve |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=1963-05-25 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eagle Oil and Shipping Company==
{{main|Eagle Oil and Shipping Company}}
Pearson started to acquire [[History of the oil tanker#Breaking the Standard Oil monopoly|steam tankers]] to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on the [[River Tyne]] launched SS ''San Cristobal'' (2,041 tons) in 1906 and [[Swan Hunter]], also on Tyneside, launched SS ''San Antonio'' (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought SS ''James Brand'' (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her ''San Bernardo''.

In 1912 Pearson founded the [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company|Eagle Oil Transport Company]] in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= [[Marconi Company|Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph]] |date=1912-02-29 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title= Form $5,000,000 Line.; Cowdray Interests to Build Fleet to Carry Mexican Oil Products |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE1DB123BE633A2575AC2A9649C946396D6CF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company''' in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.{{sfn|Godley|2007|pp=15, 16}}

Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=15}} at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]3 million.{{sfn|Godley|2007|p=18}} Eagle Oil Transport lost a number of ships to enemy action in the First World War. After the First World War, Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet. It bought numerous new tankers, including six of about 13,000 tons each. When Royal Dutch Shell bought Pearson's oil interests, that included Eagle Oil Transport and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum as well as Mexical Eagle Petroleum.

In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the [[Eagle Oil and Shipping Company]]. In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers of about 8,000 tons each.&lt;ref name=Lloyds1940&gt;{{cite book |title=Lloyd's Register of Shipping |year=1935 |publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]] |location=London |page= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the UK.{{sfn|Talbot-Booth|1942|p=461}} During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the UK. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil's ships and killed at least 206 officers, men and [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships#World War II|DEMS]] gunners serving aboard them.

[[File:MT SAN DEMETRIO.jpg|thumb|300px|{{MV|San Demetrio}} reached the Clyde in 1940 with a cargo of aviation spirit despite having been damaged by shellfire from the ''Admiral Scheer'']]
Among the ships lost was {{MV|San Demetrio}} (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. ''San Demetrio'' was repaired and returned to service, but the [[U-boat]] [[German submarine U-404|U-''404'']] torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off [[Virginia]] in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.

In 1942 the [[Ministry of War Transport]] placed a number of [[Empire ship#Tankers|Empire ships]] under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. One was sunk by enemy action in 1943&lt;ref name=WreckSiteNorseman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?30614 |title=SS Empire Norseman [+1943] |last1=Claes |first1=Johnny |last2=Vleggeert |first2=Nico |date=2010-01-23 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two [[T2 tanker]]s that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

'''''Murder in Samarkand''''' (published in the US under the title '''''Dirty Diplomacy''''') is a non-fiction book by British activist and former ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]]. The book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/books/murder-in-samarkand/ |title=Murder in Samarkand — Documents |work=Craig Murray's blog |accessdate=18 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forms an account of his period as the British ambassador in [[Tashkent]] in 2002–2004. The work explains how Murray sacrificed his diplomatic career to speak out against the [[Government of Uzbekistan|Karimov administration]]'s suppression of [[human rights]] and British double standards over torture in [[Iraq]].

==Publishing difficulties==
The book was originally published by Mainstream (Edinburgh) in 2006 but only after several battles. Before its publication, many potential readers had been contacted through Internet posts and e-mail listings to raise interest and by creating a body of public opinion, to guard against the publisher being 'bullied' out of printing the book by government pressure. These communications also mentioned how supporting government documents which were originally planned for inclusion had been forcibly removed because of copyright laws. This, despite Murray's assertions that many had received a formal release and thus should have been within the [[public domain]]. Their forced removal, Murray has said is the government "trying to claw back the very limited gains in [[Freedom of Information]] in the UK",&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in Samarkand'', preface, page 13 (2007 paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt; especially attempts to close websites on which the supporting documents were posted instead. Though many attempts to do this have proved successful, media interest has also meant that the documents frequently re-surface on [[mirror website|mirror sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blairwatch.co.uk/node/1200 Craig Murray documents — The media catches on *UPDATED*], ''Blairwatch'' blog, 11 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover controversy==
A minor controversy involved the choice of photographs on the 2007 paperback edition, two of the three photos having been the same as those previously appearing in the 2004 ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' guide to Central Asia by [[Bradley Mayhew]], [[Paul Clammer]] and [[Michael Kohn]]. Neither shows [[Samarkand]]. The rear cover of ''Murder in Samarkand'' uses the same photo of [[Bukhara]] that was the guide book's cover photo. Murray's front cover uses a sunset scene that had appeared on page 7 of the guide (and shows [[Khiva]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Lonely Planet: Central Asia'' page 7&lt;/ref&gt; There were no copyright issues in this case as both photos were licensed through [[Getty Images]].&lt;ref&gt;''Murder in Samarkand'', back page credit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lonely Planet: Central Asia'', page 512 credit&lt;/ref&gt;  Murray has stated he did not choose the cover and does not like its "masculine" appearance.

==Movie version==
A movie version of the book is in development. Paramount bought the rights and developed a script written by [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]. [[Michael Winterbottom]] was attached to direct and actor [[Steve Coogan]] to play Murray. After disagreements over the script, Paramount passed on the project, their rights meaning no one else could produce Hare's script.

==Radio play==
Following Paramount's decision to pass on the film script, [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]] convinced them to release the audio rights to the script, and rewrote it as a radio play. The radio play of ''Murder in Samarkand'' was broadcast on 20 February 2010 on [[BBC Radio 4]], with [[David Tennant]] as Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qs5x7 |title=BBC Radio 4 Programmes – Saturday Play, Murder in Samarkand |work=BBC |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was nominated for best drama at the [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]] 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/31734/neil-mckays-rip-boy-receives-nomination-for |title=Nominations for Sony Radio Awards |first=Matthew |last=Hemley |work=The Stage |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
=== Singapore Armed Forces (1979 &amp;ndash; 2007) ===
Ng enlisted in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) in 1979 and was commissioned as an artillery officer in December that year.&lt;ref name="USACAC" /&gt; Throughout his military career, he held various appointments, including the following: Commanding Officer, 21st Battalion Singapore Artillery; Assistant Chief of the General Staff (Plans); Commander, 3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade; Head, Joint Operations Department; Commander, 3rd Division; Director, Joint Operations and Planning Directorate; Chief of Staff (Joint Staff); Chief of [[Singapore Army|Army]].&lt;ref name="Change of Chief of Defence Force and Service Chiefs" /&gt; He relinquished his appointment as the Chief of Army on 1 April 2003 and succeeded [[Lim Chuan Poh]] as the [[Chief of Defence Force (Singapore)|Chief of Defence Force]] (CDF).&lt;ref name="Change of Chief of Defence Force and Service Chiefs" /&gt;

As the CDF, Ng laid the blueprint for the 3rd Generation SAF by overseeing the development of new operational concepts to further integrate the Army, [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Navy]] and [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Air Force]]. He also commanded the SAF's humanitarian assistance and disaster relief response in [[Aceh]] and [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], as well as similar missions to [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Phitsanulok]] in 2006. He retired from the SAF on 23 March 2007 and was succeeded by [[Desmond Kuek]] as the CDF.&lt;ref name="New Chief for the SAF" /&gt;

=== Temasek Holdings (2007 &amp;ndash; 2011) ===
After leaving the military, Ng joined [[Temasek Holdings]] and took up the following positions in the company: Head of Energy &amp; Resources; Co-Head of Australia &amp; New Zealand &amp; Co-Head of Strategy; Senior managing director.&lt;ref name="World Shipping Council Board Members"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ng Yat Chung|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-council/board-members/ng-yat-chung|publisher=World Shipping Council|accessdate=27 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130927045848/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-council/board-members/ng-yat-chung|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neptune Orient Lines (2011 &amp;ndash; 2017) ===
Ng joined the board of [[Neptune Orient Lines]] (NOL) as an Executive Director in May 2011 and was appointed Group President and Chief Executive Officer in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ng Yat Chung takes over as NOL's CEO from Oct 1|url=http://www.theedgesingapore.com/the-daily-edge/business/33142-ng-yat-chung-takes-over-as-nols-ceo-from-oct-1.html|publisher=The Edge Singapore|accessdate=27 September 2013|date=30 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301142231/http://www.theedgesingapore.com/the-daily-edge/business/33142-ng-yat-chung-takes-over-as-nols-ceo-from-oct-1.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the following organisations: [[World Shipping Council]]; International Advisory Panel of the Singapore Maritime Institute; Singapore Advisory Panel of the [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.nol.com.sg/wps/portal/nol/aboutus/ourboard|publisher=NOL|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2016, it was announced that [[Temasek Holdings|Temasek]] will tender its NOL shares to CMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/temasek-tenders-nol-shares-cma-offer-now-unconditional|title=Temasek tenders NOL shares; CMA offer now unconditional|last=Lee|first=Jamie|website=The Business Times|access-date=2016-06-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612040630/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/temasek-tenders-nol-shares-cma-offer-now-unconditional|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng, as the then-CEO of NOL, said that "without the scale necessary to compete on costs, the best choice was to sell." and "compared with our competitors, we also didn't have the scale" as the primary reason for the sale of Singapore's shipping icon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/nol-did-not-adapt-fast-enough-says-ceo|title=NOL did not adapt fast enough, says CEO|last=hermes|date=2016-06-08|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-06-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612082441/http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/nol-did-not-adapt-fast-enough-says-ceo|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Maersk Line and CMA CGM were reported to be interested to acquire NOL and eventually, CMA CGM emerged as the buyer.

Ng defended his performance at NOL as "NOL's past successes were built on its business model as a premium service line... This was always the way for NOL, even before the 2008 financial crash, and it did well." He then acknowledged that the company had been "a bit slow and reluctant to change".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Following the sale of NOL to CMA CGM, Mr Ng eventually relinquished his role as chief executive of NOL. Thus, effectively when Temasek tenders all of its 66.8 per cent stake. According to NOL's 2013 financial report, Mr Ng's annual compensation was at least USD 2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nol.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/0287d7004366d4f58e78df46234df752/NOL-Annual-Report-2013.pdf|title=NOL 2013 Financial Report|last=|first=|date=2013|website=www.nol.com.sg|publisher=Neptune Orient Lines Financial Report|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, Ng stayed on as Special Advisor from June 2016 to May 2017.&lt;ref name="ST20170526"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ng Yat Chung to be SPH CEO from Sept 1; Alan Chan to retire after 15 years|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/ng-yat-chung-to-be-sph-ceo-from-sept-1-alan-chan-to-retire-after-15-years|publisher=Straits Times|accessdate=26 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526174326/http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/ng-yat-chung-to-be-sph-ceo-from-sept-1-alan-chan-to-retire-after-15-years|archivedate=26 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2016, Ng was appointed as Singapore Press Holdings' independent director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-appoints-nols-ex-ceo-ng-as-independent-director | title=SPH appoints NOL's ex-CEO Ng as independent director | publisher=[[Business Times (Singapore)|Business Times]] | date=20 July 2016 | accessdate=27 November 2017 | author=Kenneth Lim | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042839/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-appoints-nols-ex-ceo-ng-as-independent-director | archivedate=1 December 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2017, Reuters reported that CMA managed to turn Neptune Orient Lines around, with NOL posting a $26 million net profit for Q1 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shipping firm CMA CGM upbeat as profits rise again|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cmacgm-results/shipping-firm-cma-cgm-upbeat-as-profits-rise-again-idUSKCN18F1I9|accessdate=14 October 2017|work=Reuters|date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044537/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cmacgm-results/shipping-firm-cma-cgm-upbeat-as-profits-rise-again-idUSKCN18F1I9|archivedate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng has been criticised by numerous publications for not being able to do so, despite five years as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loh|first1=Andrew|title=French company makes NOL profitable – less than 1 year after acquiring it from S’pore|url=http://www.theindependent.sg/french-company-makes-nol-profitable-less-than-1-year-after-acquiring-it-from-spore/|accessdate=14 October 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014202941/http://www.theindependent.sg/french-company-makes-nol-profitable-less-than-1-year-after-acquiring-it-from-spore/|archivedate=14 October 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mothership20170527"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Martino|title=Ex-NOL CEO Ng Yat Chung is the best person to lead Singapore Press Holdings?|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/05/ex-nol-ceo-ng-yat-chung-is-the-best-person-to-lead-singapore-press-holdings/|accessdate=14 October 2017|work=Mothership.sg|date=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170928163809/https://mothership.sg/2017/05/ex-nol-ceo-ng-yat-chung-is-the-best-person-to-lead-singapore-press-holdings/|archivedate=28 September 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore Press Holdings (2017 &amp;ndash; present) ===
Ng took over as CEO of Singapore Press Holdings on 1 September 2017&lt;ref name="ST20170526"/&gt;, with speculation that he was appointed to downsize various departments within the group.&lt;ref name="Mothership20170527"/&gt;

On 12 October 2017, Ng announced a retrenchment exercise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quah|first1=Michelle|title=SPH revamps for better footing in digital information age|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-revamps-for-better-footing-in-digital-information-age|accessdate=12 October 2017|work=The Business Times|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012085923/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sph-revamps-for-better-footing-in-digital-information-age|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was aimed at lowering the company's wage costs by up to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tani|first1=Mayuko|title=Singapore's biggest newspaper publisher accelerates 10% job cut- Nikkei Asian Review|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/Singapore-s-biggest-newspaper-publisher-accelerates-10-job-cut|accessdate=14 October 2017|work=Nikkei Asian Review|date=12 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014203920/https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/Singapore-s-biggest-newspaper-publisher-accelerates-10-job-cut|archivedate=14 October 2017|language=en|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Singapore Press Holdings's wage costs in 2016 were approximately $362.55 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPH Summary Report 2016|url=http://www.sph.com.sg/system/misc/annualreport/2016/SPH%20Summary%20Report%202016.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031120429/http://www.sph.com.sg/system/misc/annualreport/2016/SPH%20Summary%20Report%202016.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggested that they would be lowered by just under $33 million.

'''Osman Ahmed Osman''' ({{lang-ar|عثمان أحمد عثمان}}) &amp;lrm; (April 6, 1917 – May 1, 1999) was an Egyptian [[engineer]], [[General contractor|contractor]], [[entrepreneur]], and [[politician]].  Known commonly as el-mo'alim ("the boss"), Osman founded the [[Arab Contractors (company)|Arab Contractors]] (the largest Arab contracting firm between the 1960s and 1980s) and led the Egyptian effort to build the [[Aswan Dam]].  He went on to become the Egyptian Minister of Housing and Development and later a member of the Egyptian Parliament.

== Early life ==

Osman was born on April 6, 1917, in the town of [[Ismailia]] in [[Egypt]].  Osman was born to an impoverished family, whose situation was made worse after his father died in 1920, when Osman was three years old.  His eldest brother, Mohamed, dropped out of school to provide a steady income to support the family.  As a child, Osman himself often had to work to supply additional income.

Upon completing his schoolwork, Osman moved to [[Cairo]] to pursue a degree in [[Civil Engineering]].  Unable to afford tuition, rent, or even public transportation, Osman improvised: he received a scholarship from [[Cairo University]], lived with his older sister, and commuted on a bike he had assembled himself.  Osman excelled and graduated in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in [[Civil Engineering]].  He then returned to his hometown, [[Ismailia]].  He worked with his maternal uncle, an illiterate but savvy contractor, for 18 months.

== Osman's dream ==

Osman's dream was to build a large, successful contracting firm.  At the time, all such firms operating in the Middle East were European.  After only 18 months of work experience, Osman founded ''Osman Ahmed Osman, Engineer &amp; Contractor'', which would later become the [[Arab Contractors (company)|Arab Contractors]].  His startup capital was 180 [[Egyptian Pound]]s he had saved up from his earlier job.  Osman was the only owner and employee.  He operated out of a small one-room office, and undertook various small projects, such as building small shops and garages, repairing buildings, etc.  With Osman's hard-work, intelligence, and fantastic organizational skills, the company grew and his operations expanded, but he struggled to compete with foreign firms for larger-scale projects.  He began to undertake larger projects, such as erecting an all-girls school and a theater, and eventually expanded his operations to Cairo.

== Osman's success in the Arab countries ==

In 1950, Osman traveled to Saudi Arabia.  The [[Persian Gulf]] area was experiencing a huge boom in the construction sector, largely related to the oil boom.  Osman was able to take advantage of this, and within a short period of time was carrying out multimillion-dollar projects in Kuwait, Libya, Iraq, and the UAE, amassing a great deal of wealth.  Osman mentions that in most of these countries, he found the construction markets dominated by monopolies and cartels of foreign companies.

In 1956, Osman returned to Egypt.  By this time, the Egyptian revolution, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, had taken place.  Osman returned with a bang, winning a $48 million contract for Nasser's pet project, the [[Aswan Dam]].  However, Osman's entrepreneurial style was not compatible with Nasser's socialist revolution.  Despite this, the Arab Contractors continue to thrive in Egypt, since Nasser's confrontational strategy with Israel required construction such as bunkers, airports, missile silos, etc.

In 1961, Nasser's regime fully nationalized the Arab Contractors.  Osman was abroad at the time, and faced a choice of whether to return, or continue pursuing his wealth abroad.  Osman returned to Egypt, claiming that he felt it his duty to his country and his employees.  Osman pledged that the company would continue to operate at the same level regardless of who it was owned by, which seemed difficult at the time.  Osman had practiced a wage-incentive program within his company, which would be illegal for any public sector company.  However, after his success at the [[Aswan Dam]] project, Nasser allowed Osman to continue running the company, and a special law was passed to allow public sector companies, that did a substantial part of their business abroad (which was the case for the company), to be able to flexibly determine wages and incentives.

== Osman thrives under Sadat ==

Nasser's death in 1970 came as a shock for the country.  However, Osman welcomed Sadat as a breath of fresh air.  Osman and Sadat had been friends for several years.  Osman was highly critical of Nasser's policies and believed that the Egyptian people had paid a high prices for Nasser's combination of domestic repression and foreign adventurism.

In 1973, Sadat launched the October War.  Again, the Arab Contractors played a role; the company built the ferries that carried Egyptian forces across the Suez canal.

== Relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood ==

Osman was known to have ties to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], although he was never a member.  [[Hassan al-Banna]] founded the Muslim Brotherhood from the same town Osman grew up in [[Ismailia]].  Al-Banna was an Arabic teacher in the town, and Osman was one of his students. In his autobiography, Osman declares that he was a member of the Brotherhood "in spirit" only; he believed in many of the founding principles, but his devotion to his work and his company kept him from being an actual member.  However, he condemns the "jihaz al sirri" (the "secret apparatus"), an arm of the Muslim Brotherhood that would later give rise to militant offshoots.  Osman proclaimed that youths who channel their frustration towards violence are "wasting their lives".

Osman hired several members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in key positions in his company, often in his overseas offices. In several situations, he hired members who had been jailed and released, or had fled the country to avoid suffering that fate.  This practice was a source of conflict between Osman and the government. He claims to have been regularly harassed for this reason. He was once detained for 24 hours and questioned about "whether or not he was a member" of the Brotherhood.

==Osman the politician==

Politically, Osman was a staunch supporter of President [[Anwar Al Sadat]]. Like Sadat, Osman believed in [[capitalism]], [[free-market]] principles, and open-door policies with trade, with certain restrictions.  He believed that the private sector should be allowed to thrive; only certain sectors, like utilities, should be public.  He denounced Nasser's socialist agenda as merely a ploy to gain support of the masses. For example, Nasser guaranteed jobs for all university graduates. Osman said that this policy was a trick to gain support of the people, but that the policy itself was not sustainable or practical.  In his book, he warns graduates from accepting the default government position, saying that the government would not be able to provide such a large number of jobs. Osman argued that the "owner of any private project is interested in expanding it along with his wealth, and expansion of the project can only mean increased production and job opportunities".

Like Sadat, Osman also believed that it was in Egypt's (and the region's) best interest to try and tackle the [[Israeli-Palestine conflict]] diplomatically.  Osman believed that by doing so, the Arab countries would be able to win over the rest of the world. Osman accompanied Sadat on his visit to Israel in 1977 to speak at the [[Knesset]].

Osman believed that for developing a country, business and economic development were a form of national duty far more important than many political issues.

== Philosophy and management style==

Despite having no formal managerial training, Osman proved to be an excellent leader.  Osman stressed the importance of keeping employees happy, secure, and comfortable as a way to increase productivity.  Many of these ideas emerged in the [[Arab Contractors (company)|Arab Contractors]], but would later be implemented at a national level.  For example, Osman led the first effort in Egypt to set up employee pension funds, as well as medical insurance.  These were first implemented for Arab Contractors employees, but later expanded to encompass all government employees.

Osman felt that if he could solve day-to-day employee problems, employees would be more focused on their work and more loyal.  Osman would often provide free transportation, food, and medical care for his employees.  During the Aswan Dam erection, Osman set up a hospital, a school, a park, etc. for the thousands of employees that were relocated to Aswan.  These would later serve as a model for the Arab Contractors Medical Facility and the Arab Contractors Technical Institute.

Osman believed strongly in the power of personal relationships.  In his autobiography, Osman mentions his belief that a leader must pursue two types of relationships.  Firstly, one must maintain strong and positive relationships internally, within the company.  Also, one must create external relationships outside the company.  Osman believed both could be accomplished by treating those around him well, and practicing a strong work-ethic.  High-quality work would serve as excellent marketing.  Osman was an avid networker, and practiced his philosophy within the company, within Egypt, and even within the entire Middle East.  Osman maintained personal relationships with officials (even heads-of-state) in any country in which he operated.

== Criticism ==

Critics of Osman tend to be critics of Sadat, arguing that Osman exploited his close relationship with Sadat to gain political power and financial success.  Osman and Sadat were known to be close friends, from even before Sadat's presidency.  Osman and Sadat had very similar views, and were neighbors in El Haram [[Giza]]. Osman's eldest son, [[Mahmoud Osman]], married Sadat's youngest daughter, Jihan (Nana) Al Sadat, further solidifying the tie.

Osman, as one of Sadat's close friends and political allies, was subjected to much criticism, most of which was ultimately aimed at Sadat.  It is said that Osman was the second most powerful man in Egypt during Sadat's presidency.  Defenders of Osman argue that he amassed most of his wealth during the Nasser presidency, mostly outside of Egypt (in other Arab countries).  In fact, they argue, most of Osman's wealth was invested in the [[Arab Contractors (company)|Arab Contractors]], which was nationalized by Nasser.  Critics point out that Osman remained in control of the Arab Contractors, even after nationalization (a rare occurrence under Nasser's regime), and that he kept key familial allies and friend in top positions in the company, ultimately remaining in control, and using that control to leverage other business endeavors.

== Later life ==

Osman died in 1999.  He suffered from several medical conditions in the last decade of his life, include heart problems and [[Alzheimer's disease]].

== Legacy ==

The Arab Contractors still remains one of the largest construction companies in Egypt.  However, its ties to the Osman family were severed in 2001 when the last member of the family, Ismail Osman, was removed from his CEO position by the government [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/564/ec1.htm].  At the time, the company was suffering severe financial problems, including a massive debt (the nation as a whole was suffering a liquidity crisis).  [[Ismail Osman]] argued that the problems were a result of the government's refusal to pay its debts to the Arab Contractors, while demanding more work from the company on government projects: "The government owes us money, and we owe the banks money, yet the state does not pay us the interest on our late payments to the banks. It is not the fault of the company. It is the fault of the overall system."

The company still bears the Osman Ahmed Osman name. The company's football club's stadium was renamed [[Arab Contractors Stadium|Osman Ahmed Osman Stadium]] following his death.  One of the main avenues in downtown Ismailia is named after Osman, in his tribute.

The [[Osman Group]] is a group of companies privately owned by members of the Osman family.  It was founded in 1974, and today is owned / run by Osman Ahmed Osman's four sons - Mahmoud, Ibrahim, Ahmed, and Mohamed - as well as their cousins Mohamed and Amr.  The companies mostly operate in construction-derived areas, but also agriculture, information technology, etc.

== Daly TV Show ==

In Ramadan 2007, a TV series featuring Nour Al-Sherif was aired on Arabic satellite channels.  Many people drew parallels between the main character of the show (Saad El-Daly), and Osman Ahmed Osman, but the creators of the show have denied basing that character on Osman.  The Osman family was reportedly unhappy with the show, claiming that the show drew on Osman's early life and rise from poverty into success, while showing the main character as a corrupt, greedy, crime-linked tycoon after his success.

'''Patokh Chodiev''' ({{lang-ru|Фа́ттох Каюмович Шо́диев}}; ''Fáttoh Kayúmovich Shódiev''; born 15 April 1953, in [[Jizzakh]] ([[Uzbek SSR]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}"Chodiev, Patokh, né à Jizak (Ouzbékistan) (Russie) le 15 avril 1953" in Ministère de la Justice,  [http://staatsbladclip.zita.be/moniteur/lois/1997/08/13/loi-1997009624-print.html Loi accordant les naturalisations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104085148/http://staatsbladclip.zita.be/moniteur/lois/1997/08/13/loi-1997009624-Print.html |date=4 November 2010 }}, ''[[Belgian Official Journal]]'', 25 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[London]]-based [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] oligarch with [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian citizenship]] who, with [[Alexander Mashkevich]] and [[Alijan Ibragimov]], is part of the "Trio," a group of Central Asian businessmen who made their fortune through deals in minerals, oil, gas, and banking in Kazakhstan. Chodiev is currently ranked #275 on the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of billionaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/patokh-chodiev/?list=billionaires|title=Patokh Chodiev|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Patokh Chodiev was born in [[Uzbekistan]]. He studied [[international law]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] at the Moscow State Institute of International Affairs (MGIMO),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/71a13774-b3e0-11e2-ace9-00144feabdc0|title=ENRC founders made good in Kazakhstan|last=|first=|date=May 3, 2013|website=Financial Times|access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a doctorate in political science. Speaking Japanese fluently, he joined the diplomatic service specializing in Russian-Japanese commercial relations and subsequently lived in [[Tokyo]] for a few&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/c-est-qui-ce-chodiev/article-normal-118743.html|title=C'est qui, ce Chodiev ?|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Chodiev created an international charitable organization, the Chodiev Foundation, to promote innovation, art and education in [[Eurasia]] and [[Southeast&amp;nbsp;Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1380121/article/actualite/belgique/2016-11-30/chodiev-est-aussi-mecene-revele-knack|title=Chodiev est aussi mécène, révèle Knack|last=lesoir.be|work=lesoir.be|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the Chodiev Foundation registered a representative office in Uzbekistan, in order to provide humanitarian assistance and healthcare to orphanages in the country. Reports also stated that Chodiev plans to build several shopping malls as well as a metallurgical plant in [[Tashkent]] as part of an investment push into Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rus.ozodlik.org/a/28727289.html|title=Еще один узбекский миллиардер решил открыть бизнес на исторической родине|last=Озодлик|first=Радио|work=Радио Озодлик|access-date=2017-11-21|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 1997 Patokh Chodiev acquired Belgian citizenship.&amp;nbsp;This led to a debate in the media about how his naturalization was obtained, since Chodiev does not speak any of the three official languages of Belgium ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]]) fluently. Furthermore, the [[Belgian State Security Service]] expressed concerns about Chodiev’s relations to other [[Russia]]n businessmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/milliardaire-belge-inculpe-51b7c11fe4b0de6db98bf152|title=Milliardaire belge inculpé|access-date=2017-03-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marcernst.com/dwnlds/Walter_De_Bock_Tractebel.pdf|title=Tractebel draait zijn Kazak|last=|first=|date=2 February 2002|website=|publisher=De Morgen|access-date=22 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually found "nothing to report."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/3071770/2017/02/03/Peu-d-info-disponible-sur-Chodiev-au-moment-de-sa-demande-de-naturalisation.dhtml|title=Peu d'info disponible sur Chodiev au moment de sa demande de naturalisation|date=2017-02-03|work=7s7|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patokh Chodiev was also accused of having received help in this matter from the mayor of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], {{ill|Serge Kubla|fr}}. His Belgian naturalization was finally the subject of an official inquiry in January 2017, about which the Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' wrote on 11 January 2017: “When Serge Kubla wrote to Claude Eerdekens on 16 May 1997, all the lights were already green for Chodiev: he had the support of the SPF Justice, the State Security Service, the Aliens Department, the Waterloo police and the Public Prosecutor's Office, and therefore also that of the naturalization service.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://plus.lesoir.be/77198/article/2017-01-11/kazakhgate-qui-pouvait-savoir-en-1997|title=Kazakhgate: «Qui pouvait savoir en 1997?»|work=Le Soir Plus|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801200919/http://plus.lesoir.be/77198/article/2017-01-11/kazakhgate-qui-pouvait-savoir-en-1997|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2017, Serge Kubla assured “under oath" not to have intervened on Chodiev’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1456113/article/actualite/belgique/politique/2017-03-08/kazakhgate-kubla-assure-sous-serment-ne-pas-avoir-agi-dans-dossier-chodi|title=Kazakhgate: Kubla assure "sous serment" ne pas avoir agi dans le dossier Chodiev|last=lesoir.be|work=lesoir.be|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief investigator of the case, Jean-François Kayser, stated that “there is no evidence of Mr. Kubla's physical intervention with Mr. Vandewalle”, referring to the Chief Commissioner of the Waterloo police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://plus.lesoir.be/85061/article/2017-03-08/kazakhgate-kubla-t-il-influence-le-travail-de-police|title=Kazakhgate: Kubla a-t-il influencé le travail de police?|work=Le Soir Plus|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary commission of inquiry concluded unanimously on 30 April 2018 that Chodiev’s naturalization procedures had not been influenced by Serge Kubla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/03/28/parlementaire-onderzoekscommissie-kazachgate-bereikt-geen-unanim/|title=Meerderheid en oppositie staan tegenover elkaar in de parlementaire onderzoekscommissie Kazachgate|last=NWS|first=VRT|date=2018-03-28|work=vrtnws.be|access-date=2018-05-23|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also cleared Chodiev of any involvement in the passing of the penal transaction law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/04/27/kazachgate--patokh-chodiev-wil-verontschuldigingen-van-belgische/|title=Kazachgate: Patokh Chodiev wil verontschuldigingen van Belgische autoriteiten|last=NWS|first=VRT|date=2018-04-27|work=vrtnws.be|access-date=2018-05-23|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chodiev’s lawyer has accused the commission of having been biased against Chodiev. However, through his lawyer, Chodiev said he is willing to drop a formal complaint against several commission members on the condition that he receive a letter from a representative of the Belgian authorities admitting that the commission had operated inappropriately, subjected Chodiev to “slander”, and acknowledging the negative impact of the investigation on Chodiev and his family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 1999, the energy company [[Tractebel]] lodged a complaint against two of its employees, accusing them of embezzling part of the  $55 million in consulting fees paid by Tractebel to Patokh Chodiev and his two associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/c-est-qui-ce-chodiev/article-normal-118743.html|title=C'est qui, ce Chodiev ?|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/economie/libre-entreprise/un-dossier-embarrassant-51b87737e4b0de6db9a6c0c5|title=Un dossier embarrassant|access-date=2017-03-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate to this case, the three partners were under investigation in Belgium on suspicions of [[forgery]] and [[money laundering]], but the [[Brussels]] public prosecutor dropped any proceedings on June 17, 2011, within the framework of the extension to the criminal transaction law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/c-est-qui-ce-chodiev/article-normal-118743.html|title=C'est qui, ce Chodiev ?|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1172633/article/actualite/belgique/2016-04-05/panama-papers-fortune-cachee-chodiev|title=Panama Papers: la fortune cachée de Chodiev|last=lesoir.be|work=lesoir.be|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such the three paid a lump sum settlement of 522,500 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/kazakhgate-chodiev-n-a-paye-que-522-500-euros-pour-sa-transaction/article-normal-577073.html|title=Kazakhgate : Chodiev n'a payé que 522.500 euros pour sa transaction|date=2016-11-25|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the Brussels prosecutor’s office confirmed to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in August 2011 that no legal case against Chodiev and his associates had been active since June that year and that the case was considered settled. According to the representative, no judgement had been made against Chodiev, Mashkevich and Ibragimov who “are therefore presumed innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/95f8ecc4-c8dd-11e0-a2c8-00144feabdc0|title=Case against three ENRC oligarchs settled|last=|first=|date=17 August 2011|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Together with Alexander Mashkevich and Alijan Ibragimov, Chodiev runs various ventures in the minerals sector in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Africa]] and [[Brazil]]. In 2007, their enterprise was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became part of the FTSE 100 in 2008.

'''Personal bankruptcy''' law allows, in certain [[jurisdiction]]s, an [[individual]] to be declared [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. Virtually every country with a modern [[law|legal]] system features some form of debt relief for individuals. Personal bankruptcy is distinguished from corporate bankruptcy.

==By country==
The DICE report 2006 of Munich's ifo Economic Research compared international personal bankruptcy in selected OECD-countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailinformationen zur Publikation|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/de/ifoHome/publications/docbase/details.html?docId=14567419|accessdate=19 April 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Bankruptcy in the United States#Personal bankruptcy}}
In the United States, the same chapters of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code|Bankruptcy Code]] are applied in both personal and corporate bankruptcies. Most individuals who enter bankruptcy do so under [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] (a "reorganization" plan) or [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] (a "liquidation" of debtor's assets). More rarely, personal bankruptcy proceedings are carried out under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Does Bankruptcy Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of personal bankruptcy, from the viewpoint of the debtor, is receiving a [[bankruptcy discharge|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discharge in Bankruptcy - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/discharge-bankruptcy-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The concept behind [[bankruptcy in Canada]] is that an individual assigns (surrender) everything they own to a [[Licensed Insolvency Trustee|trustee in bankruptcy]] in exchange for the elimination of their [[unsecured debts]].

The rules for filing personal bankruptcy in each province and territory differ slightly. In some areas of Canada individuals may be permitted to keep (exempt) certain property. Common items for exemption include clothing, furniture, appliances, motor vehicles, medical and dental aids, a home, family [[heirloom]]s, and some insurance. In basic terms, any property the debtor might require to survive can be exempt. Personal Bankruptcy will eliminate most, if not all, of an individual’s debt, but it also impacts their future ability to obtain credit.

The cost of personal bankruptcy in Canada depends on the individual’s monthly family income, the size of the family, and their assets (such as RRSPs). An alternative to personal bankruptcy (in Canada) is a Consumer Proposal. Another option in Canada is a debt consolidation. No matter what option they choose, they can often turn to a trustee in bankruptcy for a free consultation.

===Israel===
Personal bankruptcy in Israel is governed by the Bankruptcy Ordinance, 1980.&lt;ref name="Niemi-KiesiläinenRamsay2003"&gt;{{citation|author1=Johanna Niemi-Kiesiläinen|author2=Iain Ramsay|author3=William C. Whitford|title=Consumer Bankruptcy in Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-S7UWhRvNjUC|date=1 January 2003|isbn=978-1-84113-358-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debtors and their creditors may apply to the court for bankruptcy. If it is granted, an automatic stay enters into force and a trustee (frequently the Official Receiver) is appointed for the debtor's assets. The automatic stay does not bar [[secured creditor]]s' lien enforcement. Bona fide debtors usually receive a discharge either immediately (if they have practically no assets) or within several months to several years from the onset of proceedings (during which time the debtor is mostly required to pay a periodic sum, set by the court, that goes towards paying the creditors). Since 1996, Israeli personal bankruptcy law has shifted to a relatively debtor-friendly regime, not unlike the American model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EFRAT|first=RAFAEL|title=THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ISRAELI BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM AS A REFLECTION OF SOCIETAL CHANGES|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol101/Efrat.pdf|publisher=[[Florida State University]]|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PeterKozler.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Peter Kosler]]
'''Peter Kosler''' or '''Kozler''' (16 February 1824 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1879) was a [[Carniola]]n [[lawyer]], [[geographer]], [[cartographer]],  [[activist]], and [[manufacturer]]. He was of [[ethnic German]] origin, but also identified with [[Slovenes|Slovene culture]] and advocated the peaceful coexistence of the Slovene and German cultures in [[Carniola]].

Kosler was born in [[Koče, Kočevje|Koče]], a village south of [[Kočevje]] in [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]], in what was then the [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Austrian Kingdom of Illyria]], and is now [[Slovenia]]. He is best known for creating the first map of the [[Slovene Lands]], called ''[[Kosler's Map|Zemljovid Slovenske dežele in pokrajin]]'' (Map of Slovene Lands and Provinces). Made already from 1848 until the end of 1852, it was published only in 1861. Despite this, it had a significant impact in the time of the Slovene national awakening.

Born in a relatively well-to-do family, Kosler made a fortune with beer manufacturing and was the founder of the [[Union Brewery (Ljubljana)|Union Brewery]]. He gave large amounts of money to support Slovenian cultural associations and institutions. He was close to the conservative [[Old Slovene]] political movement.

Kosler bought [[Cekin Mansion]] just outside the [[center District, Ljubljana|center]] of Ljubljana and renovated it in a neoclassical style. Today, the mansion houses the [[National Museum of Contemporary History]]. The Koslers also owned a mansion ({{lang-sl|Kozlerjeva palača}}) in the center of Ljubljana, close to [[Congress Square]] ({{lang|sl|Kongresni trg}}) and [[Čop Street]] ({{lang|sl|Čopova ulica}}), which was regarded as one of the finest Baroque buildings in the city. The building was slated for demolition in 1956 and torn down by the Communist authorities in 1961&lt;ref&gt;Drnovšek, Marjan, France Rozman, &amp; Peter Vodopivec. 1997. ''Slovenska kronika XX. stoletja: 1900–1941''. Ljubljana: Nova revija, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to widen the nearby street, which caused a public outcry and marked a milestone in the development of postwar urban development in Ljubljana. According to an interview with art historian Damjan Prelovšek in October 2006, trees now grow at the site of the former building, demonstrating that its demolition was a political decision and unnecessary in order to widen the street. 

Kosler also owned a plot of land in the [[Ljubljana Marshes]] known as Kosler's Thicket ({{lang-sl|Kozlerjeva gošča}}). During [[World War II]], the plot was used as a mass grave for victims of the [[Slovenian Home Guard]] torturer and killer [[Franc Frakelj]].

Kosler died in [[Ljubljana]] and is buried at [[Žale|Žale cemetery]] in Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grobovi.zale.si/index.aspx?Lang=ENG Žale cemetery grave index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214181756/http://grobovi.zale.si/index.aspx?Lang=ENG |date=2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121721462 Peter Kosler's grave at Žale cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a Slovenian [[postal stamp]] was dedicated to Kosler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.posta.si/postne-znamke/534?year=1999 PS | Poštne znamke&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{professional responsibility}}
{{Competition law}}
In its most general sense, the '''practice of law''' involves giving [[legal advice]] to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal [[negotiation]]s and [[court]] proceedings such as [[lawsuit]]s, and is applied to the professional services of a [[lawyer]] or attorney at law, [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or [[civil law notary]]. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  [[Agency (law)|agents]]. These professions include [[real estate]], [[banking]], [[accounting]], and [[insurance]]. Moreover, a growing number of [[legal document assistant]]s (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by [[computer]]-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the [[software]] in order to construct the [[Legal instrument|legal documents]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the practice of law is conditioned upon [[Admission to practice law|admission to practice of law]], and specifically [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] of a particular [[U.S. state|state]] or other territorial [[jurisdiction]]. The [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Law Institute]] are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf |title=State Definitions of the Practice of Law |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114222449/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized practice of law===

"Unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by [[statute]], [[regulation]], or court rules.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

====Definition====
The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" is variable, and is often conclusory and [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]],&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garner, Bryan A. ed. |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7th |place=St. Paul MN |publisher=West |pages=1191–1192 |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'', it is the doing of a lawyer's or [[counsel]]or's work by a non-lawyer for money.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines unauthorized practice of law as "The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed.  Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies.  Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. . . .&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers |publisher = American Law Institute|year=1998 |edition=4 cmt c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; Some states have defined the "practice of law" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arbitration and The Unauthorized Practice of Law |journal=[[ARIAS Quarterly U.S.]] |publisher=AIDA Reinsurance &amp; Insurance Arbitration Society |date=First Quarter 2006 |volume=13 |pages=16–19 |first1=David M. |last1=Spector |first2=Jessica |last2=Romero |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085329/http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers.&lt;ref name="BNA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uslawwatch.com/2010/08/16/finance/bna-insights-state-regulation-unauthorized-practice-law-arbitration-mediation-trend-permitting-multijurisdictional-practice-alternative-dispute-resolution/  |title=BNA INSIGHTS: State Regulation of Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arbitration and Mediation: The Trend Toward Permitting Multijurisdictional Practice in Alternative Dispute Resolution |date=August 16, 2010 |work=Securities Regulation &amp; Law Report |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfRtIxtVG48C&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;f=false |title=Arbitration: essential concepts |first1=Steven C. |last1=Bennett |pages= 175–178 |place=New York |date=May 2002 |publisher=Incisive Media, LLC |isbn= 978-0-9705970-8-3}} {{ISBN|0-9705970-8-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States bankruptcy court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|Eastern District of Tennessee]] has held that "providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice."&lt;ref name=software/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; The [[North Carolina State Bar]] has held that "definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice."&lt;ref name=software&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Software Practice Law?

[[Texas]] law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.123.

Gov’t Code sec. 38.122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of "Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0454/Sections/0454.23.html §454.23 Fla. Stat.] (2016)("Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree."&lt;/ref&gt; which is punishable by up to six months in prison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html §775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.](2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and $5000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html §775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat.] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] has a law which makes it a “[[Disorderly conduct|disorderly person]]s offense” to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a “crime in the fourth degree” to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=21|section=22|citeonly=true}} In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Lindsay|title=2015 Survey of Unlicensed Practice of Law Committees|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/2015_upl_report_final.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 December 2016|date=September 2015|quote=The Florida Bar continues to lead the country in funding UPL enforcement, spending approximately $1.8 million annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called "learned professions" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a [[monopoly]], the existence of laws governing (or defining) "unauthorized practice of Law" does not, ''ipso facto'' mean that they will be enforced.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unauthorized+Practice |title=Unauthorized practice |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge [[Richard Posner]] characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers.&lt;ref name="Federalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/the-abas-attack-on-unauthorized-practice-of-law-and-consumer-choice |title=The ABA's Attack on "Unauthorized" Practice of Law and Consumer Choice |date=May 1, 2003 |first1=George W.C. |last1=McCarter |publisher=[[The Federalist Society|The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge observed that the legal profession is “a cartel of providers of services relating to society’s laws” which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. "Modern economists call it '[[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]]', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members’ incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry."&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in [[Arizona]] for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Creasy'', 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, "Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a [[Sunset provision|sunset law]] in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in ''State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.'', 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in ''Arizona Title''."&lt;ref&gt;Rose at 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The '''Reichmann family''' is a Canadian family best known for their property empire built through the [[Olympia and York]] company. At the family's peak, their combined wealth was estimated at $13bn, making them the fourth richest family on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/jun/07/3|title=Rival bidders moving in on Canary Wharf|last=Adams|first=Richard|date=2003-06-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunes waned, particularly with the ill-fated [[Canary Wharf]] development which saw the family business file for bankruptcy in 1992 with debts of $20bn. Since then, the family's interests have grown and recovered.

The Reichmanns were originally from the small [[shtetl]] of [[Beled]], [[Hungary]] but the ambitious Samuel Reichmann moved them to [[Vienna]] in 1928 where he became a successful merchant. He and his wife Renée had six children:
* Eva Reichmann Heller (1923-1984)
* [[Edward Reichmann]] (1925–2005)
* Louis Reichmann (b. 1927)
* [[Albert Reichmann]] (b. 1929)
* [[Paul Reichmann]] (1930–2013)
* Ralph Reichmann (b. 1933)

During the [[Second World War]], the family fled first to [[Paris]] and then to the neutral city of [[Tangier]]. There Samuel became a prominent business leader specializing in the currency trade. Renée became a renowned humanitarian aiding victims of the [[Holocaust]], arranging food parcels to be delivered through the Spanish Red Cross to concentration camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bianco|first1=Anthony|title=Faith And Fortune Paul Reichmann: Talented, pious, driven--but not infallible|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1997-01-19/faith-and-fortune|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the financial success of life in Tangier the family left to avoid the turbulence of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] independence from the [[French Morocco|French protectorate]]. Eva settled in [[London]], but Edward went to [[Montreal]] where in 1955 he founded Olympia Flooring and Tile to import [[tile]]s from Europe. Edward described Montreal with its large [[History of the Jews in Canada|Jewish population]] and opportunity for profits fondly and soon the rest of the family followed him to Canada.

Louis joined Edward in Montreal but Albert, Paul, and Ralph settled in [[Toronto]] where they first expanded Edward's tile business but then moved into construction and property development. Samuel was the leader of this business that became known as York Developments. Albert and Paul played a secondary but central role, while Ralph remained in charge of the tile business.

In the late 1960s Edward's Montreal business was faltering and on the verge of collapse. He was only saved from ruin by a bail-out from his younger brothers in Toronto. Embarrassed at this turn of events Edward left Canada for Israel.

Over time, through successful projects in Toronto and New York, Olympia &amp; York became the largest property development and management firm in the world and the Reichmanns one of its richest families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/richest-people/rich-100-reichmann-family/|title=Canada’s Richest People: The Reichmann family|date=2015-12-24|work=Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the family remained strongly committed to their [[Haredi Judaism]].

In the early 1990s, the business empire and family's fortune was brought low by the [[Canary Wharf]] project in London. In 1987, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had seen the transformation of the World Financial Centre in Manhattan, enlisted Paul to transform the docklands of Canary Wharf into a financial powerhouse. This project proved catastrophic, as banks were reluctant to move three miles east of [[the Square Mile]]. By 1992, O&amp;Y declared bankruptcy in the biggest corporate failure of all time and the Reichmann fortune was greatly reduced. Since then the family has continued to be involved in tiles and stone, retirement care, and real estate development deals around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">'''Richard Burbidge''' (2 March 1847 – 31 May 1917) was an [[England|English]] [[merchant]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Wiltshire]], educated at [[Devizes]] and [[Melksham]], and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to a provision merchant in [[Oxford Street, London]], afterwards starting in business as a provision merchant at the age of 19. Fourteen years later he became general superintendent of the Army and Navy Auxiliary Stores. In 1882 he was appointed general manager of Whiteley's, [[Westbourne Grove]], and in 1891 entered the service of [[Harrods]], Brompton Road, of which he was afterwards managing director. By 1916, he had increased its profits from £16,000 to over £200,000, and it had become one of the largest of the London stores. He also did a good deal to ensure shorter working hours for shop assistants.

Burbidge was the “private citizen” who anonymously presented about £30,000 to the fund for acquiring [[the Crystal Palace]] for the public in 1913. During [[World War I]], he was responsible for the building and fitting up of two hospitals in [[Belgium]], and was a member of many government committees, including the advisory committee of the Ministry of Munitions and the committee of inquiry into the Royal Aircraft workings, of which he was chairman.

He was created a [[baronet]] in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29483 |date=22 February 1916 |page=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Burbidge baronets]]). He died in [[London]].

'''谭根 Tam Kan (18 Dec 1917 - 10 Jun 2001)
籍贯：原籍广东新会'''

'''Tam Kan ([[simplified Chinese]]:谭根)''' was born in [[Xinhui]] (新会), a city district in the city of [[Jiangmen]] (江门) in the province of [[Guangdong]] (广东) in southern China.  He is the second son of Tam See Chow's second marriage to Wun Li King.  Although Tam See Chow was a rich and high-ranking official, Tam Kan went through hardship since the age of three when his father died.  He learnt carpentry and worked to support his mother, and went through the hardship of surviving WW2.   He was one of many workers that participated in the construction of many building structures in Guangzhou including [[Haizhu Bridge]] (海珠桥), National Sun Yat-sen University Library (国立中山图书馆), and [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] (白云机场).  He later went to Hong Kong and worked for the Asiatic Petroleum Company (香港亚细亚油公司) and the [[British North Borneo Company]] and in 1951 was one of the early batch of workers selected for transfer from China to North Borneo (now called Sabah).(1)

During the 50s, Tam Kan worked as a foreman of the British North Borneo Company, contributed and witnessed the early development of North Borneo.  He oversaw many constructions of the early buildings and landmarks of which many still exists in today's Sabah, such as the Standard Chartered Bank building (opposite Suria Sabah) and The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) building.  He established his own company 'Tam Kan Contractors Company' (谭根建设公司) in 1958 in [[Kota Kinabalu]], previously known as [[Jesselton]] before independence.

After North Borneo attained self-government on 31 August 1963, Tam Kan became one of the very first to establish a foothold in the booming construction industry and the company went on to build many iconic buildings in the state of Sabah, such as [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Kota Kinabalu]]; Segaliud Bridge; Teachers' Training College; 100 Police Flats in Kepayan; Police Flats in Tanjung Aru, shop houses and many more. Although many still exist today,  some have either been demolished or are going to be demolished such as ‘'''Tam Kan Flats'''’ as reported recently in 2015 by Malaysian media. (2)(3)(4)(5)

Tam Kan also constructed, owned and operated the Winner Hotel, one of only two tallest buildings in Kota Kinabalu in the 60s.  His residence at 5 1/2 mile Tuaran Road was a unique building designed by himself in the 60s and is believed to be the first private residential address with a full sized water fountain.
 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Segaliud Bridge.jpg|thumb|Segaliud Bridge on Sungai Segaliud built in 1977]] --&gt;

Tam Kan was also the founding President of the West Coast Sze Yi Association (四邑公會) where he initiated the funding and construction of the eight-storey Sze Yi building in Bundusan Commercial Centre in Kota Kinabalu.  He was president from 1986-1989 and an honorary president (永久名誉会长).  The Association established an education loan scheme for the good of members' children in 2015, continuing Tam Kan's belief that all children should receive an education. (6)

His many contributions to Sabah, Malaysia, formally known as North Borneo was recognized by the Head of State and he was conferred the titles 'BSK' and 'ASDK' in the 70s and 80s respectively for outstanding services for Sabah Malaysia (see Wikipedia under [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Malaysia]] for more info).

[[File:Tam Kan ASDK.jpg|thumb|Title Given by Head of State]]

Tam Kan was a philanthropist who worked tirelessly to help the less fortunate.  He was particularly keen in promoting education and sponsoring children in attaining formal education, both locally and overseas, as he himself was deprived of an education.  He had donated generously to the running and building of schools and libraries in Malaysia and in China.

Tam Kan had never forgotten his roots, and was actively involved and contributed in the development of Xinhui.  He was given a special award (振兴新会贡献奖) for the contribution and promotion of city by the Xinhui City Government and is in the list of outstanding overseas Chinese originated from the city. (7)(8)(9)

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Contribution to Society.jpg|thumb|Contribution in the Building of Pavilion (缅賢亭) at 5.5 mile Tuaran Road Kota Kinabalu]] --&gt;

Tam Kan died on 10 June 2001 in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia at the age of 84 having suffered from ill health for a number of years.

Tam Kan married '''Lam Chee ([[simplified Chinese]]:林珠, 26 April 1922 - 24 January 2012)''' on 28 October 1942 and has four sons and three daughters.

Tam Kan Contractors Company is no longer active in the Malaysian construction industry.

'''''Tucker: The Man and His Dream''''' is a 1988 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and starring [[Jeff Bridges]]. The film recounts the story of [[Preston Tucker]] and his attempt to produce and market the [[1948 Tucker Sedan]], which was met with scandal between the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]]" and accusations of stock fraud from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. [[Joan Allen]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Frederic Forrest]] and [[Christian Slater]] appear in supporting roles.

In 1973, Coppola began development of a film based on the life of Tucker, originally with [[Marlon Brando]] in the lead role. Starting in 1976, Coppola planned ''Tucker'' to be both a musical and an [[experimental film]] with music and lyrics written by [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]. The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's [[American Zoetrope]] experienced financial problems. ''Tucker'' was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, [[George Lucas]], joined as a producer.

The film received critical praise, but was a box office disappointment. Nonetheless, ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' produced a spike in prices of Tucker Sedans, as well as a renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] engineer [[Preston Tucker]] has been interested in building cars since childhood.  During [[World War II]] he designed an armored car for the military and made money building gun turrets for aircraft in a small shop next to his home in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]].  Tucker is supported by his large, extended family, including wife Vera and eldest son Preston Jr.

As the war winds down, Tucker has a dream of finally building the "car of the future."  The "Tucker Torpedo" will feature revolutionary safety designs including disc brakes, seat belts, a pop out windshield, and head lights which swivel when you turn.  Tucker hires young designer [[Alex Tremulis]] to help with the design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous [[Dodge Chicago Plant]] to begin manufacturing.  Abe hires Robert Bennington to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.

Launching "the car of tomorrow" in a spectacular way, the Tucker Corporation is met with enthusiasm from [[shareholder]]s and the general public. However, the Tucker company [[board of directors]], unsure of his ability to overcome the technical and financial obstacles ahead, send Tucker off on a publicity campaign and attempt to take complete control of the company. While Tucker travels the country, Bennington and directors change the design of Tucker's car to a more conventional design, eliminating the safety and engineering advances Tucker was advertising.  At the same time, Tucker faces animosity from the Big Three and the authorities led by Michigan Senator [[Homer S. Ferguson]].

Tucker returns from his publicity tour and confronts Bennington, who curtly informs him that he no longer has any power in the company to make decisions, and the engine originally planned for the car is not viable.  Tucker then receives a call from [[Howard Hughes]], who sends a private plane to bring Tucker to his aircraft manufacturing site.  Hughes advises Tucker to purchase the [[Franklin Engine Company|Aircooled Motors Company]], which can supply both the steel Tucker needs, as well as a small, powerful helicopter engine that might replace Tucker's original "589" power plant.

Faced with being unable to change Bennington's design, Tucker modifies the new engine and installs it in a test Tucker in the secrecy of his backyard tool and die shop. This prototype proves successful in both durability and crash testing.  However, Tucker is confronted with allegations of stock fraud. Ferguson's investigation with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), causes Karatz, once convicted of bank fraud, to resign, fearful that his criminal record will prejudice the hearings. [[Yellow journalism]] starts ruining Tucker's public image even though the ultimate courtroom battle is resolved when he parades his entire production run of 50 Tucker Torpedoes, proving that he has reached production status.

After giving a speech to the jurors on how [[capitalism]] in the United States is harmed by efforts of large corporations against small entrepreneurs like himself, Tucker is acquitted on all charges. Nevertheless, his company falls into [[bankruptcy]] and Preston Tucker dies of [[lung cancer]] seven years later, never able to realize his dream of producing a state-of-the-art automobile.

The film ends with all 50 Tucker Sedans being driven down the streets of downtown Chicago, admired by everyone as they pass.

==Background==
[[File:1948 Tucker Sedan at the Blackhawk Museum.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A 1948 Tucker Sedan at the [[Blackhawk Museum]]]]
From childhood, Coppola envisioned a film about the Tucker automobile&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; and while attending the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in the early 1960s, further refined a film concept based on the life of Preston Tucker.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; In June 1973, during the filming of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), Coppola announced his intention to start development at American Zoetrope as writer, producer and director. He had already approached Marlon Brando for the lead role.&lt;ref name=dance&gt;Schumacher 1999, pp. 183, 283, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; He then purchased the [[life rights|rights]] from the Tucker Estate in 1976,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; and, in addition to Brando, discussed the leading role with [[Jack Nicholson]]&lt;ref name=Bridge/&gt; and also considered [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt; Taking inspiration from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), [[Kabuki]] theater and the work of [[Bertolt Brecht]], Coppola initially planned to make ''Tucker'' as a "dark kind of musical."&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; He later said that the idea approximated the style of an experimental film,&lt;ref name=promo&gt;Coppola, Francis Ford. ''Tucker: The Man and the Car '' (1948) DVD [[audio commentary]] (included on the DVD for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988), released in 2000). San Francisco: American Zoetrope / Paramount Home Video, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]'' (1985), which he produced.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt;

The musical would have featured Tucker predominantly, but storylines would have interwoven [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]] as supporting characters. Leonard Bernstein agreed to write the music, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green were hired to write the lyrics. They all spent a week at Coppola's home in California,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; planning the musical which resulted in Bernstein writing one song.&lt;ref name=promo/&gt; Coppola also approached [[Gene Kelly]] as a consultant for the dance choreography.&lt;ref name=dance/&gt; However, financing for ''Tucker'' fell through when Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope, filed for bankruptcy after the box office failures of ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, James.

Retrieved: May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola abandoned ''Tucker'' for the time being and went to work on ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name=kit/&gt;

In 1986,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; during the production of ''[[Captain EO]]'' (1986),&lt;ref name=child/&gt; Coppola's friend George Lucas encouraged him to revive development for ''Tucker'', believing it to be "the best film Francis had ever been involved with."&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; In addition, Lucas agreed to serve as [[executive producer]] and offered the use of his filmmaking companies, [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=child/&gt; He also convinced Coppola to drop the musical idea in favor of doing a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the films of [[Frank Capra]], especially ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; Coppola became interested in the [[American Dream]] aspect of the storyline, as well as post-World War II capitalism and politics.&lt;ref name=promo/&gt; At one point, Coppola approached Capra to produce the film with Lucas, however, Capra thought Tucker was a failure and Coppola dropped that plan.&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt;

Coppola originally intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to his commitment to the filming of ''[[Gardens of Stone]]'' (1987), engaged [[Arnold Schulman]] who scripted Capra's ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959). Schulman was angered when screenwriter [[David Seidler]], who'd been previously attached to the project, was granted a co-writing credit by the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]], stating: "Believe me, I was pissed off about the credit grabbing on ''Tucker''. I'm still pissed off. That is one instance where every word of the script is ''mine''."&lt;ref&gt;https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft138nb0zm&amp;chunk.id=d0e15701&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola was also displeased by Seidler's credit, stating: "They gave a credit to a writer who had nothing to do with the script that I used."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher 1999, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt; and ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and [[pre-production]] proceeded.&lt;ref name=kit/&gt;

==Production==
Development and production for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' included the involvement of Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast in the title role and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that."&lt;ref name=Bridge&gt;[[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]] and Jean McDowell.

Retrieved: May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The construct of family values played a crucial role in the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;

[[Principal photography]] started with first unit shooting on April 13, 1987 in the [[Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant]] in [[Richmond, California]], doubling for the [[Dodge Chicago Plant]]. The majority of outdoor filming took place in [[Marin County, California]] as well as various locations including [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Novato, California|Novato]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Baxter&gt;Baxter 1999, pp. 367–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven of the original 51 Tucker '48s still exist,&lt;ref name="Kinney"/&gt; and many are in excellent condition.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen 1996, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one of the cars were borrowed from members of the Tucker Automobile Club of America and were extensively used as both "set dressing" and in starring roles.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; Three cars were used to film the crash scene, a "before" version, with a fiberglass body, the car used to do the actual rollover was a Studebaker modified to look like a Tucker (this car is currently in a privately owned museum in Tallahassee, Florida), and an "after crash" version which was another fiberglass body fitted to a Ford LTD chassis.&lt;ref name=volocars&gt;[http://www.volocars.com/attractions-hollywood.htm "TV and movie car collection."] ''volocars.com''.

==Historical accuracy==
Coppola had a certain amount of personal affinity with the short-lived legacy of Preston Tucker. His father, Carmine Coppola, had been one of the original investors in Tucker stock and purchased one of the cars off the production line.&lt;ref&gt;LaFrance, J.D. [http://www.erasingclouds.com/0811tucker.html "Cinematic Pleasures: Tucker, The Man and His Dream."] ''Erasing Clouds'', Issue 25, July/August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola included the involvement of Preston Tucker's children, grandchildren and members of the Tucker Estate during the development of ''Tucker'' in the late 1970s, as well as during filming in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Aubry, Kim, producer. ''Under the Hood: Making Tucker'' (included on the DVD for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988), released in 2000). San Francisco: American Zoetrope / Paramount Home Video, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola and Lucas acknowledged that they purposely intended to portray Tucker in an entirely sympathetic way.&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; Both filmmakers each owned two Tuckers,&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; although Lucas eventually sold one of his cars in September 2005 for $385,500.&lt;ref name="Kinney"&gt;Kinney, Dave. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/automobiles/collectibles/29TUCKER.html "Only 52 Tuckers Were Built, but Their Impact Is Still Felt."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 29, 2006. Retrieved: May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tucker Automobile Club made up of a legion of Tucker owners and collectors pronounced in their trade journal, ''TACA'', that the "basic theme of the movie is quite accurate..." although "the film compresses time and often takes artistic license with facts in order to more effectively present the story."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Larry. [http://www.tuckerclub.org/html/movieinfo.html "''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'': A Look Behind The Scenes."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129122559/http://tuckerclub.org/html/movieinfo.html |date=2009-01-29 }} ''TACA'', #417. Retrieved: June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, spoke of the historical inaccuracies. "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will find a lot of what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters."&lt;ref name=type/&gt; Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. "We knew the facts," she continued, "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain."&lt;ref name=type/&gt; [[Alex Tremulis]], who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit. 

The car Tucker first showed to the public was nicknamed the "Tin Goose."  However, the Tin Goose shown in the film is a "production" Tucker, painted in the same maroon color, but there are many detail differences between the two cars.  Most noticeable are the rear doors, they opened in a conventional manner in the "Tin Goose," but virtually all other Tuckers built featured "suicide" style rear doors which were hinged at the rear.

The '''Wright Brothers Medal''' was conceived of in 1924 by the Dayton Section of the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]], and the SAE established it in 1927 to recognize individuals who have made notable contributions in the engineering, design, development, or operation of air and space vehicles. The award is based on contributed research papers.&lt;ref name=Significant&gt;{{cite book|title=Significant American and international awards in aviation|author=United States. Navy Dept.
