}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of [[oceanic basin]]s (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking [[abyssal hill]]s).

The creation of the abyssal plain is the result of the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower [[oceanic crust]]. Magma rises from above the [[asthenosphere]] (a layer of the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]), and as this [[basalt]]ic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained [[sediment]]s, mainly [[clay]] and [[silt]]. Much of this sediment is deposited by [[turbidity current]]s that have been channelled from the [[continental margin]]s along [[submarine canyon]]s into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of [[pelagic sediments]]. Metallic [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], and [[copper]].

Owing in part to their vast size, abyssal plains are believed to be major reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]. They also exert significant influence upon ocean [[Carbon cycle|carbon cycling]], dissolution of [[calcium carbonate]], and [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations]] over [[Geologic time scale|time scales]] of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal [[ecosystem]]s are strongly influenced by the rate of [[marine snow|flux of food]] to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as [[climate change]], [[Trawling|fishing practices]], and [[Ocean nourishment|ocean fertilization]] have a substantial effect on patterns of [[primary production]] in the [[photic zone|euphotic zone]].&lt;ref name="CRS2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abyssal plains were not recognized as distinct [[Physical geography|physiographic]] features of the [[Seabed|sea floor]] until the late 1940s and, until very recently, none had been studied on a systematic basis. They are poorly preserved in the [[Geologic record|sedimentary record]], because they tend to be consumed by the subduction process.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;

==Oceanic zones==
{{Main|Oceanic zone}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|Pelagic zones]]
The ocean can be conceptualized as being divided into various [[oceanic zone|zones]], depending on depth, and presence or absence of [[sunlight]]. Nearly all [[Organism|life forms]] in the ocean depend on the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activities of [[phytoplankton]] and other marine [[plant]]s to convert [[carbon dioxide]] into [[Total organic carbon|organic carbon]], which is the basic building block of [[organic matter]]. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.&lt;ref name=PNAS2009&gt;{{Cite journal

The stratum of the [[water column]] nearest the surface of the ocean ([[sea level]]) is referred to as the [[photic zone]]. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, is referred to as the [[euphotic zone]] (also referred to as the ''[[Pelagic zone#Epipelagic .28sunlit.29|epipelagic zone]]'', or ''surface zone'').&lt;ref name="Csirke 1997 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Csirke|1997|p=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the [[mesopelagic zone|dysphotic zone]] (dysphotic means "poorly lit" in Greek).&lt;ref name=Britann&gt;{{Cite web

The euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight [[Insolation|irradiance]], depending on [[season]], [[latitude]] and degree of water [[turbidity]].&lt;ref name="Csirke 1997 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britann/&gt; In the clearest ocean water, the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150&amp;nbsp;metres,&lt;ref name="Csirke 1997 4"/&gt; or rarely, up to 200&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt; [[solution|Dissolved substances]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|solid particles]] absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less.&lt;ref name="Csirke 1997 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt; The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1000&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref name=Buesseler/&gt; Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the [[seabed]] is the [[aphotic zone]], a region of perpetual darkness.&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buesseler/&gt;

However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of [[Diel vertical migration|movement upwards through the water column]] into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on [[marine snow|material sinking from above]],&lt;ref name=CRS2008/&gt; or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in [[chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[archaea]] found near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[cold seep]]s.

The aphotic zone can be subdivided into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the [[bathyal zone]], extending from a depth of 1000&amp;nbsp;metres down to 3000&amp;nbsp;metres, with water temperature decreasing from {{convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} as depth increases.&lt;ref name=Morelle2008&gt;{{Cite web

The flat appearance of mature abyssal plains results from the blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (clay particles) blown out to sea from land, and the remains of small [[Phytoplankton|marine plants]] and [[Zooplankton|animals]] which sink from the upper layer of the ocean, known as [[pelagic sediments]].

[[Echo sounding|Acoustic sounding]] equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the [[German Meteor expedition]] aboard the German research vessel [[Meteor (1915)|Meteor]] (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects.

As technology improved, measurement of depth, [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of large areas of the ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording [[Fishfinder|fathometer]] enabled Tolstoy &amp; Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], is now known as the [[Sohm Abyssal Plain]].&lt;ref name=Tolstoy1949&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[Challenger Deep]] is the deepest surveyed point of all of Earth's oceans; it is at the south end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. The depression is named after HMS ''Challenger'', whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110310200116/http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc878.html station 225]. The reported depth was 4,475 [[fathom]]s (8184&amp;nbsp;meters) based on two separate soundings. On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the [[Simrad Optronics|Simrad]] EM120 [[Multibeam echosounder|multibeam sonar bathymetry]] system aboard the [[RV Kilo Moana (T-AGOR-26)|R/V ''Kilo Moana'']] indicated a maximum depth of 10971&amp;nbsp;meters (6.82 miles). The sonar system uses [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth (this is an error of about 22&amp;nbsp;meters at this depth).&lt;ref name=Moana1&gt;{{Cite web

In contrast to the approximately 2&amp;nbsp;°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60&amp;nbsp;°C up to as high as 464&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Haas2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrea2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosch2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karst2009/&gt; Due to the high [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a [[supercritical fluid]] at such temperatures.

At a barometric pressure of 218 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of water is 375&amp;nbsp;°C. At a depth of 3,000&amp;nbsp;meters, the barometric pressure of sea water is more than 300&amp;nbsp;atmospheres (as salt water is [[Density|denser]] than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407&amp;nbsp;°C (''see image''). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, ''[[black smoker]]s'' and [[submarine volcano]]es can be a [[Supercritical fluid#Submarine volcanoes|supercritical fluid]], possessing physical properties between those of a [[gas]] and those of a [[liquid]].&lt;ref name=Haas2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrea2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosch2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karst2009/&gt;

''Sister Peak'' (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, {{Coord|4|48|S|12|22|W|}}, elevation −2996&amp;nbsp;m), ''Shrimp Farm'' and ''Mephisto'' (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, {{Coord|4|48|S|12|23|W|}}, elevation −3047&amp;nbsp;m), are three hydrothermal vents of the black smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near [[Ascension Island]]. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002.&lt;ref name=Haas2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrea2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosch2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karst2009/&gt; These vents have been observed to vent [[Phase transition|phase-separated]], vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407&amp;nbsp;°C were recorded at one of these vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464&amp;nbsp;°C. These [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct [[magma]]tic-[[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.&lt;ref name=Haas2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrea2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosch2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karst2009/&gt;

{{Main|Cold seep}}
Another unusual feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the [[cold seep]], sometimes called a ''cold vent''. This is an area of the seabed where seepage of [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]-rich fluid occurs, often in the form of a deep-sea [[brine pool]]. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200&amp;nbsp;meters in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Paull1984&gt;{{Cite journal

While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower oceanic trenches (&gt;7,000&amp;nbsp;m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref name=Todo2005 /&gt;

Within the abyssal and hadal zones, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have by far the greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of [[Thermophile|thermophilic]], [[Halophile|halophilic]] and other [[extremophile|extremophilic]] [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s (such as those of the sulfide-oxidizing genus ''[[Beggiatoa]]''), often arranged in large [[Biofilm|bacterial mats]] near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain.

==Exploitation of resources==
{{See also|Deep sea mining|Offshore drilling}}
In addition to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they may be used for the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and [[Oil platform|oil rigs]], [[radioactive waste]] and other [[hazardous waste]], such as [[Ammunition|munitions]]. They may also be attractive sites for [[Fishing|deep-sea fishing]], and [[Hydrocarbon exploration|extraction of oil and gas]] and other [[mining|minerals]]. Future deep-sea [[Waste management|waste disposal]] activities that could be significant by 2025 include [[Sewage treatment|emplacement of sewage and sludge]], [[Carbon sequestration|carbon-dioxide sequestration]], and disposal of [[Dredging|dredge spoils]].&lt;ref name=Glover2003&gt;{{Cite journal

As [[fish stock]]s dwindle in the upper ocean, deep-sea [[Fishery|fisheries]] are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because [[deep sea fish]] are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable in the long term given current management practices.&lt;ref name=Glover2003/&gt; Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.

Hydrocarbon exploration in deep water occasionally results in significant [[environmental degradation]] resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated [[drill cuttings]], but also from [[oil spill]]s. While the [[Blowout (well drilling)|oil gusher]] involved in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] originates from a [[wellhead]] only 1500&amp;nbsp;meters below the ocean surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Macdonald |first=Ian R. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/opinion/22macdonald.html |title=The Measure of an Oil Disaster

Sediments of certain abyssal plains contain abundant mineral resources, notably [[Manganese nodule|polymetallic nodules]]. These potato-sized [[concretion]]s of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000&amp;nbsp;meters,&lt;ref name=Glover2003/&gt; are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the [[Pacific nodule province]]) lies in [[international waters]] of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km².&lt;ref name="Smith 2008 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abyssal [[Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone]] (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.&lt;ref name=Lambshead2003&gt;{{Cite journal

Eight commercial contractors are currently licensed by the [[International Seabed Authority]] (an [[intergovernmental organization]] established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of [[Territorial waters|national jurisdiction]]) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight [[Mineral rights|claim areas]], each covering 150,000&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="Smith 2008 4"/&gt; When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800&amp;nbsp;km² of seafloor per year and disturb the [[benthos|benthic fauna]] over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000&amp;nbsp;km² (a zone at least the size of [[Massachusetts]]).&lt;ref name="Smith 2008 4"/&gt;

Limited knowledge of the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[biogeography]] and [[natural history]] of [[deep sea communities]] prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species [[extinction]]s from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales.&lt;ref name=Glover2003/&gt; In 1978, a dredge aboard the [[GSF Explorer|Hughes Glomar Explorer]], operated by the American mining [[consortium]] [[GSF Explorer#Leasing|Ocean Minerals Company]] (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000&amp;nbsp;meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the [[France|French]] Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea ([[Ifremer|IFREMER]]) conducted the ''Nodinaut'' expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned [[submersible]] [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Nautile]]'' did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.&lt;ref name=Khripounoff2006&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Aesthetic Realism''' is a philosophy founded by poet and critic [[Eli Siegel]] (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves."

The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in [[SoHo]], [[New York City]], through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.

The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that "we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;ref&gt;Statement of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, 1990: "It is a fact that men and women have changed from homosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. Meanwhile, as is well known, there is now intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is by no means central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 the Foundation discontinued its public presentation of the fact that through Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to change from homosexuality are not being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Bready, "Eli Siegel's system lives" in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', 28 July 1982: "In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "In Aesthetic Realism, beauty is the putting together of things that can be thought of as opposites….Aesthetic Realism says that reality is aesthetics….Reality is, when completely seen, beautiful: that is, reality consists of a mingling in aesthetic relation, of such opposites as the orderly and disorderly…." ''Aesthetic Realism: Three Instances''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siegel’s critical theory, "the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art." A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors'': "This philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that ‘what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life…, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.’" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|William Packard]]: "And as far as Aesthetic Realism goes, it is eminent good sense. Eli Siegel has boiled it down to a simple formula: ‘In reality, opposites are one; art shows this.’ An artist will try to see the opposites in action, in himself and in his world and eventually in his own work." "How a Major Poet Is Ostracized by Lit Cliches: Eli Siegel in View," published in ''newsArt The Smith,'' (1978) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/NewsArt-Packard-article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley: "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one. Art shows this.’" "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'', July 1964, (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell in ''Art Students League News'': "According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world." (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Philosophers have often seen reality as freedom and order, simultaneously and continually. Indeed, the first opposites I chose in my ''Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?'', 1955, were Freedom and Order. You can see these right now in the world if you look at it: freedom and order are in the street, in the ocean, in woods in upper New York State." "Good Sense for the World," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #221 (22 June 1977); URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro221.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Verlaine...has some of the subtlest music in French verse. And here we have the first description of the world which beauty and art illustrate: that is, the world is simple and various at once. It is one universe, even as it has many twigs in twilight." "Good Sense for the World" (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel reasoned, "If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "If…the structure of the world corresponds to the structure music may have or a novel may have [or any art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked. "Good Sense for the World," (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is "every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Shepp: "Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education." (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples &amp; H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.) URL: http://www.marthashepp.com/cv_syll_phil/CritPresent4Website.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Poetics, URL: http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510041505/http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html |date=2010-05-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Aesthetic Realism: a Tripartite Study," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #247 (21 December 1977) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro247.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Aesthetic Realism describe[s] the two opposed purposes in everyone’s life. As Siegel once observed, even though 'every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable,' there is also 'a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.' According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity) and, on a larger scale, to the entire world when one nation’s contempt for another leads to war." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—"the addition to self through the lessening of something else"—he or she is unjust to people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Patterson: "Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves." ''Herald Sun'' of Melbourne, Australia (19 April 2009); URL: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/better-to-try-world-on-love/story-e6frf92o-1225700167216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity)." ''Contemporary Authors''; URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell: "Among many bold pronouncements none by Siegel are stronger than the assertion that contempt of the world produces insanity." ''Art Students League News'' (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kernan]] in ''The Washington Post'' (16 August 1978): "There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls ‘the world.’ These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. ‘Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,’ he says. Contempt can lead to insanity, according to Siegel." URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Wash-Post-Article-Kernan.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "An attitude to the world…governs one in one's everyday life. If you feel that the world is ill-managed, is contemptible, is unkind, you have to show that in how you see Mildred or how you see Morton…" "Aesthetic Realism; or, Is a Person an Aesthetic Situation?" (14 January 1969); URL: http://www.annefielding.net/Aesthetic-Situation-by-Eli-Siegel.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important.  Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff: "Nancy Starrels once attempted a working definition: Aesthetic Realism, she said, is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’" ''New York Post'' (16 June 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "As Siegel once observed,…‘every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable.’" ''Contemporary Authors''; URL:http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for "human beings placed differently from ourselves" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that "the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life." Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, "civilization has yet to begin."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Civilization Begins" in ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #228 (10 August 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major texts===
The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.  The first, ''Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, '' was written from 1941-3.  Individual chapters, including "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" and "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0910492294}}&lt;/ref&gt; were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press).&lt;ref&gt;D.E., ''Booklist,'' (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): "A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect."&lt;/ref&gt; His second text, ''Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,'' completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''

==Poetry==

Siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Starrett in the ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): "It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'&lt;/ref&gt; the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded ''The Nation'''s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality ''is'' relation, "that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things," is in this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Boldt: ''Modern American Poetry,'' p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): "Siegel’s poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‘the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do-with other things.’"&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated "have a great deal to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors'': "Siegel composed ‘Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana’ with this principle in mind, taking 'many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing] in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.'"&lt;/ref&gt; These are lines near the end of the poem: &lt;br&gt;
::Hot afternoons are real; afternoons are; places, things, thoughts, feelings are; poetry is;
::The world is waiting to be known; Earth, what it has in it!  The past is in it;
::All words, feelings, movements, words, bodies, clothes, girls, trees, stones, things of beauty,
:::books, desires are in it; and all are to be known;
::Afternoons have to do with the whole world….

The search for that which connects all branches of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism on Art and Self," ''Peter Gorlin Interviews Eli Siegel on The World of Art, WKCR, 18 April 1963'' published in ''Definition 15'' (Definition Press, 1963): "Aesthetic Realism is an educational method. And the first thing that it asks is: What is there in common in biology, and in history, and in the study of music, and in psychology, and in religion, and in cookery, and in the study of the history of sport, and in the study of fabrics, and in the study of chemistry, and the study of geology, and in the study of the dance?  ''Is'' there something in common? The one thing that is in common is, obviously, the opposites, because in every art and every science, there is something that is and something that changes."&lt;/ref&gt; led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;''Music's Intellectual History,'' edited by Zravko Blažeković &amp; Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie (Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale, 2009), page 167: "It is a central belief of Aesthetic Realism that art, indeed, has metaphysical substance, and therefore any attempt to sever art and philosophy limits the precision and the freedom of one's mind. 'The world, art, and self,' said Eli Siegel, 'explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 24 September 1944: "These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer’s opinion, scholarly and valuable."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Villager,'' 26 July 1956: "This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel."&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that 'what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.'"&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, ''Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate an inaminate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel defined poetry as "the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel…[is the] founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism....Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, "emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Skene Catling, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 19 April 1952: "'In aesthetic realism,' Mr. Siegel said, 'emotion changes into logic: There is no rift between the two.' Emotion and logic, energy and calm, can and must coexist in poetry if it is to be good poetry, in Mr. Siegel’s opinion."&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel...founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism...[showed that] every true poem...has come from a person’s seeing something so justly that he or she has perceived in the immediate object the structure of the world itself: ''the oneness of opposites.'' And we ''hear'' that structure as poetic music. Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.' That is true about every instance of good poetry--no matter what its style, or language, or in what century it was written. On the other hand, an unauthentic poem, however impressive, however praised, is insufficiently sincere...lacks that honesty which is a self at its very center meeting what an object really is."&lt;/ref&gt; "Poetry," he wrote, "arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #181 (15 September 1976): "Poetry arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.

In thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including "Poetry and Anger," "Poetry and Love," "Educational Method Is Poetic," "Poetry and Time," "Poetry, Money, and Good Will," "A Poetic Technique of Parenthood," "Poetry and History," and "Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/lectures/&lt;/ref&gt; His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it "the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves."  This education, they assert, "makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, K. Van Outryve, Preface to ''The Critical Muse,'' p. iii (Terrain Gallery, 1973) {{ISBN|0-911492-18-6}}: "''The Critical Muse'' is an anthology permeated with the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism....Every poem on the pages that follow is about the need of a person to put together opposites in himself. What makes these poems so important is this: as they tell us about the opposites in ourselves, the ''way'' they tell us, the technique of poetry, shows that opposites can be one. The music of poetry...is the most important sign that opposites are one....In our studies with Eli Siegel, we have come to see poetry as having within it the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.  This is the education which makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel ===
In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), "a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, "Poet Outlines a Philosophy," ''Baltimore Sun,'' 2 August 1946: "More than 160 persons…attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight’s theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‘a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.’"&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in [[Greenwich Village]], where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.&lt;ref&gt;"From Here to Obscurity" by Michael Kernan, ''The Washington Post,'' 16 August 1978: "[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village…[Siegel] gave his first lessons….[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were [[Chaim Koppelman]] (1920–2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaimkoppelman.net/].&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, sculptor, printmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Trudie A. Grace, ''Same Objects/Different Visions: Etchings by Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman'' in ''Journal of the Print World'' (Winter, 2004) p. 36: "In the 1940s, Chaim Koppelman wanted to be a sculptor and then a painter, but in 1953 he switched to printmaking, attracted primarily by the potential for subtle chiaroscuro in the handling of form and atmospheric qualities as well as effects achieved in the biting of the plate."&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the printmaking department of the [[School of Visual Arts]], and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the [[Terrain Gallery]] in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff in the ''New York Post,'' Sunday, 16 June 1957: "An interesting aspect of the cultural life of this city within the past three years has been the development of the Terrain Gallery. There probably hasn’t been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‘Aesthetic Realism’ as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition….Aesthetic Realism is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art: "Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968." [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including [[Ralph Hattersley]], editor of the photography journal '' Infinity'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley, "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'' July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one; art shows this.’ Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is."&lt;/ref&gt; and Nat Herz, author of articles in '' Modern Photography'' and of the ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.''&lt;ref&gt;Nat Herz, ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,'' Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites "relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal,'' 1 September 1969: "Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‘all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.’ Since the 1940s, this poet-philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‘that the structure of reality is aesthetic.’ He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy.  A theatrical production of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen’s]] ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as "essentially good", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful?  I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life."&lt;/ref&gt; was highly praised in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kalem, ''Time,'' 19 December 1969, p. 58: "Now, in an off-off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman."&lt;/ref&gt; but severely criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kerr, "Hedda Is Not Candida," ''New York Times,'' 25 January 1970: "It is wholly boring and only boring….It doesn’t really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good.  All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Hedda Gabler: the Good Person," ''New York Times,'' 18 January 1970: "To see Ibsen’s wonderful and dangerous Hedda…as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright’s clear demands."&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence….As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor’s Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on [[Shakespeare]], [[Moliere]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], [[Strindberg]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealismtheatreco.org/outreach.htm Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism Foundation ===
The not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in [[SoHo]], New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, p.34, ''The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc., 1977): "The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life. In seminars, a consultation trio discusses aesthetic solutions to these problems, in terms of music, literature, poetry, painting, history, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Informing and educating the public has therefore become the primary task of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation…whose staff members conduct seminars, workshops, and consultation sessions." URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation offers classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, acting, and singing, and classes for children.&lt;ref&gt;Filomena Gomes, "Promising the world" in ''The Bergen Record'' 26 March 1999: "In a monthly program dubbed 'Learning to Like the World,' educators at the nonprofit foundation, established by Eli Siegel, work with children ages 5 to 12 to help them learn to use books as a tool to appreciate the world and the people around them....The world, according to the foundation’s philosophy, is made up of opposites: outside and inside, rest and motion. Similarly, children want to feel excited and feel at ease at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of [[Queens College|Queens]] and [[Hunter College]]s, [[City University of New York]]. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course "The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005) back cover: "Ellen Reiss is editor of the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' where her commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly. She is Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism, appointed by its founder, the philosopher, critic, and poet Eli Siegel; and is co-author, with Martha Baird, of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary.'' She teaches at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation and taught previously in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel died on November 8, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary, 10 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/tro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality===

A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight," ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently."&lt;/ref&gt;   Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to [[Obie]] award-winning actress Anne Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; ''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual." Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: "One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SKranz-and-AFielding.jpg|border|thumb|right|267px|alt=Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding|Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding (1980)]]

In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Homosexual Story" by Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', Issue #316, April 25, 1979. "Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'' show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elmhurst Press'' (Elmhurst, Illinois), "Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality," August 17, 1983, "Five formerly homosexual men…appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel…It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes."&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality" by Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‘Every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt;   Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Staub in ''Contemporary Authors.'' "The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‘every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.’ Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‘H Persuasion’--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women."&lt;ref&gt;"Instances of How Aesthetic Realism Sees A Matter of This Time" by Eli Siegel from ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'', show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): "It’s a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible….A person becomes educated…to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that…such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‘This is not what I want.’ Now, as I said…if people…really can say, ‘I like myself this way, really,’ –it’s not for me to say one way or the other."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. "Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 ''Free Time'' show&lt;ref&gt;''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''David Susskind Show'',&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a national syndication.  The book ''The H Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how.  In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality.  In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the ''David Susskind Show.''&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, editor, ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality'' (New York: Definition Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling ''The H Persuasion'' "less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''New York Times'' never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Green: "FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be" ''The Globe and Mail'', April 28, 1978, p.8 "Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists…who are mad at the ''New York Times'' because the ''Times,'' they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors.&lt;ref&gt;"Some News that’s Unfit to Print," ''New York Magazine'', 17 April 1978, p.8: "Though the ''New York Times'' does a fine job of covering Milanese fashions…it has somehow managed to overlook the Aesthetic Realism story. The Aesthetic Realists do not like this, and they are doing something about it….[They] have disrupted the ''Times'' city desk with more than 65 calls a day from people demanding that the story be run….What is more, the Aesthetic Realists have gone into the city streets, holding vigils in front of publisher Punch Sulzberger’s home and those of other top ''Times'' officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Many wore lapel buttons that read "Victim of the Press".&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, "Minority protesters trash First Amendment," ''St. Petersburg Times'', Wednesday, May 5, 1993, p. 11A. "For many years in New York's Greenwich Village, decorously dressed followers of poet and guru Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana") used to wear buttons proclaiming themselves ‘Victims of the Press.’"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Fischkin, ''Muddy Cup: a Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America'', (NY: Scribner) {{ISBN|0-684-80704-1}}, pages 231-232: "Linda Kunz wore a 'Victim of the Press' button on her lapel. On the first day of class, she wrote this on the blackboard: 'The purpose of all education is to like the world through knowing it--Eli Siegel.' And then this question: 'Can grammar, which is the structure of language, tell us anything about the structure of the world--including ourselves?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1987) ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3, p.158, pp. 127-8.  {{ISBN|0-691-02837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating "we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel." They were signed by 50 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, "We Have Changed from Homosexuality" March 18, 1978, ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.

The gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Roskoff, "Gay Activist Allen Roskoff Lets It All Out", ''Queerty'', "…they were telling the gay men that it was unnatural to be homosexual.  Only opposites could attract in art and in life.  The whole philosophy was about opposites, and of course that meant that homosexuality was wrong.  I guess they matched up or convinced men.  Whenever I saw a woman with a button, I would say, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t find a straight man?’  I detested these people. I mean, they were the ex-gay people."&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1982 ''Boston Globe'' article written by "the first openly gay reporter" on its staff,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 8, 2007.  "Generally regarded as the first openly gay reporter on the newspaper's staff…. Ms. Longcope, who spent 22 years at the ''Globe'' and then founded a statewide gay and lesbian newsweekly in her home state of Texas, died of pancreatic cancer March 28 in Hospice Austin's Christopher House."&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the "assertion" of change through Aesthetic Realism was "a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Longcope: "Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality," ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The assertion of change based on Aesthetic Realism is especially startling to professionals in the psychotherapeutic field after a decade of rethinking homosexuality—a process triggered by the Gay Liberation Movement."&lt;/ref&gt;  About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common.  The ''Globe’s'' ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained "strong, negative words without attribution" and "inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kierstead, Ombudsman, "''Globe'' article on ‘Aesthetic Realism’ and gays prompts complaints," ''The Boston Globe'', 24 May 1982. "On May 13, an estimated 250 people rallied on the Boston Common…in the case of The Boston Globe and the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City….The ''Globe'', once it decided to do the article…also assumed an obligation to spare no effort in thoroughly researching and investigating an organization which espouses a philosophy which is both complex and controversial. [Assistant Living Editor Ed Siegel] and writer Longcope believed that under the circumstances involved the story was fair….The ombudsman disagrees. The story, as published, contains a preponderance of material based on interviews with representatives of the gay community who, for the most part, are not un-biased in their views of Aesthetic Realism….The ombudsman believes the article, not intended as an exposé, contained a negative tone and strong negative words without attribution. It also contained inaccuracies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as "anti-gay", accusing the philosophy of offering a "gay cure" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Gay Cult Pulls Fast One" by Bill Schoell, ''The New York Blade'' April 25, 2008. "Unfortunately, Siegel and his followers believed that homosexuality was an illness ‘caused’ by self-contempt….In the 70s AR…heavily promoted the myth that they could convert people from gay to straight….New York’s Gay Activist Alliance responded by infiltrating [or "zapping"] their meetings at their Greene Street headquarters and passing out pro-gay literature."&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle.  The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight" ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "Ellen Reiss a teacher at the foundation said: ‘What we offer is a means to have people see themselves and the world as they truly are. We are not interested in grabbing people off the street and saying, "Change." If a person is gay and likes himself and the world and wants to stay that way, fine. But if a person wants to change we offer them a scientific logical approach.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to prejudice and racism==
{{Wide image|The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg|400px|''"The People of Clarendon County"—A Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.|50%|right|alt=alt text}}

In one of his earliest essays, "The Equality of Man" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting [[eugenics]]. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had "an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: "Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, "the addition to self through the lessening of something else." Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere "tolerance" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are "as real, and as deep, as one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Smith, Hickory, SC Branch, NAACP, "Back to School Rally Offers Answer to Racism," ''Hickory Daily Record,'' Friday, 21 August 2009: "The Belk Centrum Theater at Lenoir Rhyne University was packed Saturday for an intellectually stimulating Back to School Rally sponsored by the Hickory Branch NAACP....This demonstrates that people in this area are ready for new ideas in education and race relations.  Aesthetic Realism views contempt as the cause of racism, 'the addition to self through the lessening of something else'…. The criticism of contempt, including in oneself, and learning to see that the feelings of other people are as real and as deep as one's own, are essential in ending racism."&lt;/ref&gt;

On an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as "The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis," in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 13 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict "write a soliloquy of 500 words" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.&lt;ref&gt;Oron, Bernstein, Fishman, Gvili, Ratz, Levy, Shazar, "Contempt Must Be Studied for Mideast Terror to End!" ''Aesthetic Realism and the Answer to Racism,'' ed. Bernstein (Orange Angle Press, 2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: ''Asimbonanga,'' and ''Brushstrokes.'' Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, ''The Heart Knows Better,'' based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Black, ''The Heart Knows Better'', ''The Amsterdam News'', 28 October 1995: "The Heart Knows Better, produced by Ken Kimmelman of Imagery Film Ltd., was just awarded the Emmy for Outstanding National Public Service Film. The film addresses racial prejudice and was inspired by this...statement of Eli Siegel, the American poet and founder of Aesthetic Realism: 'It will be found that black and white man have the same goodnesses, the same temptations, and can be criticized in the same way. The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, "Alice Bernstein &amp; Friends."&lt;ref&gt;Robin H. King, ''South Carolina Black News'', 18 Dec. 2008: "Many people have been introduced to Alice Bernstein through her nationally published articles, and her column in the ''South Carolina Black News'' for the last five years.  She writes about what she learned  about the cause of and answer to racism from the educational philosophy, Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of ''The People of Clarendon County'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as "the education that can end racism." The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: "Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alice, ed., ''The People of Clarendon County--A Play by Ossie Davis with Photographs and Historical Documents, and Essays on the Education That Can End Racism'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007, p. xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

A production of ''The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.&lt;ref&gt;''CapitalWire'', Culture, 1 Nov. 2009: "House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn gave opening remarks at a historic event on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 21st: ''The People of Clarendon County—A Play by Ossie Davis &amp; the Answer to Racism!''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/jewishtimes.html Monumental Man: The Controversial Legacy of Eli Siegel], Melissa Goldman, Jewish Times, August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/political-surrealism/&lt;/ref&gt; Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled "Countering the Lies," saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is "1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't)."&lt;ref&gt;http://counteringthelies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

American Academy of Environmental Engineers
}}
The '''American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists''' ('''AAEES''') is a society of professional [[Engineering|engineers]] and scientists who have demonstrated special expertise in [[environmental engineering]] or [[Environmental science|science]] beyond that normally required for professional practice, in a process similar to what is required for medical and other professional specialty certifications.

In addition to education and experience, Board-Certified Environmental Engineers and Scientists must have passed written and oral examinations and reviews by an admission panel of the Academy. The Academy's certification program is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards.&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |title=Be Recognized  Among the Best Environmental Engineers and Scientists In the World |publisher=American Academy of Engineers and Scientists |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217162800/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy was founded in 1955 for the principal purpose of serving the public by improving the practice, elevating the standards, and advancing public recognition of environmental engineering through a program of specialty certification of qualified engineers.

The Academy began in 1952, when a group of [[sanitary engineering|sanitary engineers]] working in the [[public health]] and [[defense industry|defense]] communities expressed concern about the requirements for professional practice. This led to the creation of the Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE). Later, the Joint Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering was formed, composed of the ASCE, the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Society for Engineering Education]], the [[American Water Works Association]] and the [[Water Environment Federation|Water Pollution Control Federation]]. With the sponsorship and support of these five organizations, the American Sanitary Engineering Intersociety Board was incorporated under the laws of the State of [[Delaware]] on October 21, 1955. Certified sanitary engineers were identified as Diplomates (now also known as Board Certified Environmental Engineers) of the American Academy of Sanitary Engineers, and were listed on a roster with the names of each member and their specialties as recognized by the Board. Other organizations joining as sponsors included the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] in 1957 and the [[Air Pollution]] Control Association in 1962.

In 1966 the name of the Board was changed to the "Environmental Engineering Intersociety Board" (EEIB) and the name of the roster from the "American Academy of Sanitary Engineers" to the "American Academy of Environmental Engineers" (AAEE). A year later, in 1967, the Board of Trustees changed the American Academy of Environmental Engineers from just a roster of certified engineers to an organization with its own rights, bylaws and officers. This new organization was charged with working cooperatively with the EEIB in the advancement of all aspects of environmental engineering. The [[American Public Works Association]] joined as a sponsor of these organizations in 1969. The AAEE and the EEIB were merged into one organization in 1973. In 1976 the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] became a sponsor of the Academy and it was followed by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors in 1977, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1981 and the Solid Waste Association of North America in 1988. In 2011, the Academy decided to award board certifications to environmental scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |title=AAEE Approves Environmental Scientist Certification/Name Change |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217160727/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the adoption of its current name on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/AAEE-Highpoints---September-2012.html?soid=1102273204531&amp;aid=XxW79TH9tls |title=Environmental Engineering Foundation Votes To Change Name To Environmental Engineering and Science Foundation |volume=28 |number=8 |date=November 2012 |journal=Highlights |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements for board certification include a baccalaureate or higher degree in engineering or science from an accredited university, not less than eight years of professional engineering or scientific experience, and an examination on the practice of environmental engineering or science in a particular area of specialization. Exams are offered on the following topics for engineers: [[Air pollution|Air Pollution Control]], [[Sustainability|Environmental Sustainability]], General Environmental Engineering, [[Hazardous waste|Hazardous Waste Management]], [[Industrial hygiene|Industrial Hygiene]], Radiation Protection, [[Waste management|Solid Waste Management]] and Water Supply/Wastewater Management.  Scientists may choose from tests covering Air Resources, Environmental Biology, [[Environmental chemistry|Environmental Chemistry]], [[Environmental microbiology|Environmental Microbiology]], [[Environmental toxicology|Environmental Toxicology]], Groundwater and the Subsurface Environment, Surface Water Resources, or [[Sustainability science|Sustainability Science]].&lt;ref name="Brochure"/&gt;

The '''American University of Malta''' ('''AUM''') is a [[private university|private]], American-style [[liberal arts college]] in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]]. The establishment of the educational institution was announced in May 2015, and the project is meant to regenerate the South of Malta and give said area an economic and social boost.&lt;ref name=opm-presentation/&gt; Since the proposal was announced, Dock 1 in Cospicua was chosen for the head campus, while extensions are being planned for other sites in Cospicua and Żonqor, [[Marsaskala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Mounting opposition to use of ODZ land|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=14 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233523/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially established on 16 September 2016,&lt;ref name="ourbeginnings"/&gt; and it opened in September 2017.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"/&gt;

==Planning and Opening==
On 5 May 2015, the [[Jordan]]ian contracting company Sadeen Group and the [[Government of Malta]] signed an agreement at [[Auberge de Castille]] for the former to set up a private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in [[Spain]], but Prime Minister of Malta [[Joseph Muscat]] persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|title=Heads of agreement for 4,000-student American university expected on Tuesday - timesofmalta.com|date=2015-09-12|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912200657/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|archivedate=2015-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time all campuses are complete, it is to have schools of business, architecture and design, engineering, arts, sciences, and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|title=AUM - American University of Malta|date=2018-01-06|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002945/http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|archivedate=2018-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original curricula of the AUM are provided by the [[DePaul University]]. The latter did not commit any financial resources for the construction of the AUM, and it was not involved in any discussions with the Government of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DePaul University denies involvement in site selection for proposed American University of Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=8 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913161255/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|archivedate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Kristin Claes|title=Faculty create curricula for American University of Malta|url=http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|work=DePaul Newsline|date=13 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520003229/http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|archivedate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed university is meant to create a social and economic boost to localities in the [[South Eastern Region]] of Malta, which is regarded as being less developed than the rest of the island.&lt;ref name=opm-presentation&gt;{{cite web|title=Investiment għan-naħa t'isfel ta' Malta – American University of Malta|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM%20PRESENTATION.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213220/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM%20PRESENTATION.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimation of the Contribution to the Maltese Economy of the Development and Operation of an International Higher Academic Institution: Update Based on a Project Proposal Spread Over Two Sites|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM-EIA.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703110407/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM-EIA.pdf|archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has an investment of over €115 million, and it is to create around 400&lt;ref name="opm-presentation" /&gt; to 750 jobs.&lt;ref name="MT0516"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/64924/american_university_of_malta_campus_to_take_three_years_to_complete#.V3jwKfl961s|title='American University of Malta' campus to take three years to complete|last1=Dalli|first1=Miriam|date=6 May 2016|work=[[Malta Today]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604130547/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/64924/american_university_of_malta_campus_to_take_three_years_to_complete|archivedate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's estimated economic output rests at about €48 to €85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160921/local/sadeens-five-year-licence-dictated-by-law.625667|title=Sadeen’s five-year licence 'dictated by law'|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|date=21 September 2016|work=[[Times of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922140626/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160921/local/sadeens-five-year-licence-dictated-by-law.625667|archivedate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ripple effects of these changes are already being felt.

The university originally planned to take in its first students in October 2016, with lectures at [[SmartCity Malta]] until the head campus was completed.&lt;ref name=times2015-08-20/&gt; The beginning of the first academic year was later moved to 28 August 2017, with lectures held at the Dock No. 1 campus in Cospicua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=Lectures at AUM to start on August 28|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/lectures-at-aum-to-start-on-august-28.625991|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=25 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926154655/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/lectures-at-aum-to-start-on-august-28.625991|archivedate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of campus and use of ODZ land===
[[File:Site for the future American Institute of Malta.jpeg|thumb|Żonqor Point, where part of the university campus is to be built]]

When the university project was announced in May 2015, the government offered the Sadeen Group {{convert|90000|m2|abbr=on}} of Outside Development Zone (ODZ) land near Żonqor Point in [[Marsaskala]] on which to build the university. A natural park, partially funded by the university, would be set up nearby. The proposal to use ODZ land raised concerns among environmentalists, including the NGOs [[Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar]], [[Friends of the Earth]] Malta, Ramblers Association, [[Din l-Art Ħelwa]], NatureTrust Malta, [[Birdlife]] Malta, Malta Organic Agriculture Movement and Greenhouse. The Malta Developers Association also stated that a better site should be found,&lt;ref name=times2015-05-05&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort San Leonardo may be incorporated in new university campus|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=5 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928173056/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Church criticized the process used to select the land for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Church slams government’s handling of university bid|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=21 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220213628/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, residents of Marsaskala and southern Malta supported the university project by signing a petition in its favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tan-nofsinhar jiġbru petizzjoni favur il-proġett tal-università|url=http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|work=iNews Malta|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618014128/http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|archivedate=18 June 2015|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government initially planned to include the 19th-century [[Fort Leonardo]] within the university campus. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat also stated that constructing the university in Marsaskala would pressure the owners of the former [[Jerma Palace Hotel]] to redevelop the site, which has fallen into disrepair since being closed down in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalli|first1=Kim|title=University plan ‘puts pressure on Jerma site’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929031031/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|archivedate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscat responded to the environmentalists' criticism by stating that the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] would consider other sites as long as they are located in the southern part of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Ivan|title=‘University will generate €25m a year’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150504/local/university-will-generate-25m-a-year.566645|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220195817/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150504/local/university-will-generate-25m-a-year.566645|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public consultation process was subsequently made in order to select an alternative site for the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American University of Malta – Preliminary Alternative Sites Evaluation Report|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/Preliminary%20Alternative%20Sites%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214404/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/Preliminary%20Alternative%20Sites%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2015, the Front Ħarsien ODZ ([[Maltese language|Maltese]] for ''Front for the Protection of ODZ'') was set up in response to the proposed development at Żonqor Point. The group aims to protect all ODZ land in Malta, and it includes then-[[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour]] MP, turned Democratic Party (PD) members, [[Marlene Farrugia]], [[Whip (politics)|government whip]] Godfrey Farrugia and former [[Alternattiva Demokratika]] politician, turned Nationalist Party (PN) member, [[Michael Briguglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Neil|title=Godfrey, Marlene Farrugia join 'Front Harsien ODZ,' group says Zonqor project can be stopped|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=23 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811133750/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|archivedate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June, the front held a protest in [[Valletta]] against the development, and it was attended by 3000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces reduced university plans for Zonqor|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_#.VncO4PkrLIV|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=20 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010090820/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_|archivedate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, Muscat announced that the government had reached an agreement with the Sadeen Group that the campus be split between the former [[Malta Dockyard|Dock No. 1]] in [[Cospicua]] and a reduced site at Żonqor Point. The campus at Żonqor is much smaller than the one originally planned, and it will occupy the site of the water polo pitch and {{convert|18000|m2|abbr=on}} of adjoining ODZ fields. This campus is to consist of three faculties and student dormitories, with a maximum height of five stories. A new water polo pitch is also to be built to replace the one that will be demolished to make way for the university. The campus at Cospicua will occupy two former [[warehouse]]s at Dock No. 1 which were built during [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] and [[British Empire|British]] rule.

On 25 August 2016, the Planning Authority approved the restoration of the British Building at Dock No. 1, and its conversion into a campus to house part of the AUM. Parts of the building which were destroyed during [[World War II]] will be rebuilt, while an intermediate level and a new second floor with a [[Contemporary architecture|contemporary]] glass-and-steel design will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University in Cospicua granted permit|url=http://www.pa.org.mt/news-details?id=1137|website=Planning Authority|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828114710/http://www.pa.org.mt/news-details?id=1137|archivedate=28 August 2016|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation of the building is entrusted to the architect Edwin Mintoff, and it is expected to be completed by April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saliba|first1=Norma|title=American University buildings will reflect the past historic appearance of Cospicua Wharf|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/il-binjiet-tal-uaameamerican-university-buildings-will-reflect-the-past-historic-appearance-of-cospicua-wharfrican-university-buildings-will-reflect-the-past-historic-appearance-of-cospicua-wharfm-se/|work=[[TVM (Malta)|TVM]]|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to restore the Knights' Building at Dock No. 1 and convert it into part of the campus, and this renovation is planned to be completed by 2017–18. The Marsaskala campus is to be ready by 2019–20.&lt;ref name="times2016-09-25"/&gt;

===Accreditation and licensing===
In December 2015, Leader of the Opposition [[Simon Busuttil]] stated that since the AUM applied for the licence of a "Higher Education Institution", its marketing of itself as a "University" is illegal.&lt;ref name=times2015-12-15/&gt; In January 2016, the National Commission for Further and Higher Education announced that Sadeen Education Investment Ltd had been given a licence to operate a Higher Education Institution under the name ''American Institute of Malta''. This was the first step in the process to acquire a university licence.&lt;ref name=times2016-01-26&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta formally becomes American Institute of Malta, process to acquire university licence in process|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160126/local/american-university-of-malta-formally-becomes-american-institute-of.600155|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126174313/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160126/local/american-university-of-malta-formally-becomes-american-institute-of.600155|archivedate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission has stated that a degree issued by the American Institute would have the same value as one issued by the University of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=American Institute's degree 'equivalent to university's'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160201/local/american-institutes-degree-equivalent-to-universitys.600851|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=1 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201174356/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160201/local/american-institutes-degree-equivalent-to-universitys.600851|archivedate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 11 March 2016, Sadeen Education Investment Ltd was notified by a judicial letter that licensed higher education institutions are prohibited from using the word "university" in their advertising and publicity, unless they have been granted that status formally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vella|first1=Matthew|title=Watchdog fines Sadeen for marketing unlicensed 'university'|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63682/watchdog_fines_sadeen_over_aum_logo|work=Malta Today|date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2016, Economy Minister [[Christian Cardona]] said that he had "no doubt that this will be a University and not an institute.

The National Commission for Higher Education officially accredited the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month process which included financial and academic evaluations. The commission imposed a number of conditions on the AUM, including an annual audit by the [[Clemson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta gets accreditation at last|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160630/local/american-university-of-malta-gets-accreditation-at-last.617262|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701130607/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160630/local/american-university-of-malta-gets-accreditation-at-last.617262|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=Conditions imposed on Sadeen Group for university licence 'are not negotiable'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160703/local/conditions-imposed-on-sadeen-group-for-university-licence-are-not.617495|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=3 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703105715/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160703/local/conditions-imposed-on-sadeen-group-for-university-licence-are-not.617495|archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadeen asked for a compromise on these conditions, but the commission insisted that they were not negotiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=No university licence for Sadeen, one month before 'first student intake'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160910/local/no-university-licence-for-sadeen-one-month-before-first-student-intake.624564|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=10 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910171108/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160910/local/no-university-licence-for-sadeen-one-month-before-first-student-intake.624564|archivedate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conditions were accepted, the commission issued a 5-year university licence on 16 September 2016.&lt;ref name="ourbeginnings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Beginnings|url=http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|website=American University of Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002945/http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|archivedate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sadeen granted 5-year licence to run American University of Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160919/local/sadeen-granted-5-year-licence-to-run-american-university-of-malta.625569|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=19 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920185425/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160919/local/sadeen-granted-5-year-licence-to-run-american-university-of-malta.625569|archivedate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Some questions have been raised by Maltese media about whether AUM is actually American. This is especially due to the company behind the project being Jordanian. In response to this, AUM's provost John Ryder stated that the university is "not a brand or offshoot, or run by any American university ... [but it is] American in curriculum and organisation."&lt;ref name="times2016-09-25"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=AUM owner aspires for 'higher education diamond in the Mediterranean'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/diamond-waiting-to-shine.625996|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=25 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926161256/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/diamond-waiting-to-shine.625996|archivedate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curricula are officially provided by DePaul University, Chicago. A spokesperson for DePaul University issued a statement, qualifying the officiality of AUM’s curricula, saying that; "Faculty designed degree programs in areas that were requested, with the dual goals of being academically well-designed and meeting regulatory requirements in Malta. Individual faculty members were selected with the help of teams -- composed of associate deans, school directors and department chairs -- in the relevant colleges. Faculty then were asked to design the curriculum, and they were compensated for their work," also adding; "[t]he right to use our name (DePaul University) is specifically in connection to the curriculum. While specifics of any DePaul contract are proprietary, I can tell you that it went through the usual, internal multi-step review process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/11/questions-raised-about-whether-american-u-malta-really-american|title=Questions raised about whether American U. of Malta is really American {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|date=2015-10-16|access-date=2018-03-06|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016055439/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/11/questions-raised-about-whether-american-u-malta-really-american|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUM has also generated controversy with regard to the practicality of having another university in the small country of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayo|first1=Peter|title=Of Universities, Monopolies, and Public Goods|journal=Think|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|publisher=[[University of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220183841/http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government stated that the AUM would end the monopoly that the [[University of Malta]] has on higher education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=David|title=Government seeking to end University of Malta’s ‘monopoly’|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=3 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807015710/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|archivedate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, lecturers at the University of Malta disagreed with the use of the term "monopoly", stating that the university already competes with other institutions such as [[MCAST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lecturers rubbish PM's claim of university monopoly|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522183824/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|archivedate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AUM's early phase, low student intake and initial refusals to release the official enrollment figures became flashpoints of controversy. An early promotional video presented the new university's plan to admit 1,000 students in its first year, eventually reaching a total enrollment of 4,000 students by its fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Y01mF8p13tk|title=AUM Promo Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AUM officially began offering classes on Tuesday September 12, 2017, rather than Monday September 11, to avoid association with the [[September 11 attacks]] anniversary.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM Opens its Doors to the First Batch of Students|url=http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/page.aspx?rid=8697&amp;preview=1&amp;c=95493AB4B36E9D8D6637317593DB929F7C5700C8&amp;k=-534249962|work=maltachamber.org.mt|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how many students the AUM admitted for the Fall semester, Provost John Ryder would only say that student recruitment was “proving to be challenging." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM student enrolment is 'proving challenging', provost says|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170906/local/aum-student-enrolment-is-proving-challenging-provost-says.657269|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the [[Times of Malta]] reported that the AUM's revised plan was to enroll 330 students in its first semester, but the "university managed to attract 15 students"&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM firing staff after failing to attract students|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171112/local/aum-firing-staff-after-failing-to-attract-students.662834|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was denied by university officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schembri Orland|first1=Kevin|title=AUM says it has more than 15 students, but still doesn't divulge number|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-11-19/local-news/AUM-says-it-has-more-than-15-students-but-still-doesn-t-divulge-number-6736181619|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Ryder acknowledged in a [[Television Malta]] interview that the AUM student body numbered 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM rector says original targets were not realistic but is confident for the future|url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/aum-rector-says-original-targets-were-not-realistic-but-is-confident-for-the-future/|work=[[Television Malta]]|date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUM personnel decisions have also generated controversy, raising concerns about the legality of the new institution's employment policies and practices. Within a period of 7 months, 10 university employees were terminated, either by [[dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] or resignation: (1) Deputy (Construction Project) Manager (dismissal), (2) Admissions Director (dismissal), (3) Marketing and Public Relations Director (dismissal), (4) Vice President for Administrative Affairs (dismissal), (5) IT Technician (dismissal), (6) Webmaster (resignation), (7) Admissions Counselor (resignation), (8) Human Resources Director (dismissal), (9) Professor of Finance (dismissal) and (10) Dean of Student Affairs (resignation).&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=This is What the American University of Malta Looks Like Two Years Later|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking/this-is-what-the-american-university-of-malta-looks-like-two-years-later|work=lovinmalta.com|date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismissed deputy manager filed a judicial protest against Sadeen Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta deputy manager says claims against him were fabricated|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170523/local/american-university-deputy-manager-says-claims-against-him-were.648810|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former admissions director sued the university for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple file judicial protest claiming unfair dismissal by Sadeen Education Investment Ltd|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-10-20/local-news/Couple-file-judicial-protest-claiming-unfair-dismissal-by-Sadeen-Education-Investment-Ltd-6736180457|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2018, Provost John Ryder informed the twelve remaining AUM faculty members by e-mail that their employment with the university had been terminated without cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=BREAKING: American University of Malta Has Sacked All Its Faculty|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking-american-university-of-malta-has-sacked-it's-faculty|work=lovinmalta.com|date=4 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Attard|first1=Rachel|title=AUM full time lecturers said to have been 'dismissed by email'|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-01-04/local-news/AUM-full-time-lectures-said-to-have-been-dismissed-by-email-6736183231|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], the '''Beale number''' is a parameter that characterizes the performance of '''[[Stirling engine]]s'''.  It is often used to estimate the power output of a Stirling engine design.  For engines operating with a high temperature differential, typical values for the Beale number range from ( 0.11 ) to ( 0.15 ); where a larger number indicates higher performance.

==Definition==
The Beale number can be defined in terms of a Stirling engine's operating parameters:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = \frac{Wo}{P V F} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the Beale number
*'''Wo''' is the power output of the engine ([[watt]]s)
*'''P''' is the [[Arithmetic mean|mean average]] gas [[pressure]] ([[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]) or ([[MPa]], if volume is in [[centimeters|cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]])
*'''V''' is swept [[volume]] of the power piston([[meters|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]) or ([[centimeters|cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], if pressure is in [[MPa]])
*'''F''' is the engine cycle frequency ([[Hertz|Hz]])

==Estimating Stirling power==
To estimate the power output of an engine, nominal values are assumed for the Beale number, pressure, swept volume and frequency, then the power is calculated as the product of these parameters, as follows:

&lt;!-- Power = (Beale number) x (mean pressure) x (Swept volume of power piston) x (Frequency)  --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Wo = \frac{}{}B_n P V F &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">'''Beam's Eye View''' (or '''BEV''') is an imaging technique used in [[radiation therapy]] for the quality assurance and planning of External Beam Radiation Therapy treatments. These are primarily used to ensure that the relative orientation of the patient and the treatment machine are correct. The BEV image will typically contain the images of the patient's anatomy and the beam modifiers (such as jaws or Multi-Leaf Collimators (or MLCs)).

==Generation of Beam's Eye Views==
* Physical Construction:
**  BEV's can be generated by exposing a high energy film (similar to [[photographic film]]) or an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) with the treatment beam itself after it passes through the patient and any beam modifiers (such as blocks). Although this type of image is an excellent indication of the basic quality of the treatment plan, the quality of film images can be poor.
** A BEV can be created using a radiation therapy simulator which mimics the treatment geometry (couch angle, gantry angle, etc.) using an [[X-ray]] source instead of the higher energy treatment source. The jaws and blocks can be imaged on the same film as the patient's landmarks.
* Artificial Reconstruction: The BEV can be created using a [[Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph]] (or DRR) that is created from a computed tomography (or CT) data set. This image would contain the same treatment plan information, but the patient image is reconstructed from the CT image data using a physics model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture." ''The San Francisco call'', January 07, 1912.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?" ''New-York tribune'', March 23, 1920, p.11.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a book with the most interesting cartoons and winning captions as well as comprehensive information covering this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Mankoff, Robert (2008).

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its character [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] instituting rules that no one wants to follow.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com. Retrieved June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">'''Chemogenetics''' is the processes by which [[macromolecule]]s can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. Chemogenetics as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on [[chalcone isomerase]] activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of ''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forkmann G, Dangelmayr B | title = Genetic control of chalcone isomerase activity in flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 5-6 | pages = 519–27 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7437010 | doi = 10.1007/bf00484399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is very similar to [[optogenetics]] however, it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light-sensitive channels known as [[Opsin]]s.

In recent research projects, chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Prior to chemogenetics, researchers used methods such as [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]] and [[Deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulation (DBS)]] to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobrzanski G, Kossut M | title = Application of the DREADD technique in biomedical brain research | journal = Pharmacological Reports | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–221 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28092807 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharep.2016.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to optogenetics ==
[[Optogenetics]] and chemogenetics are the more recent and popular methods used to study this relationship. Both of these methods target specific brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity. However, they use different procedures to accomplish this task. Optogenetics uses light-sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons. Cells' activity, having these channels, can then be manipulated by light. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors, to affect the activity of those cells. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include [[Nucleic acid hybridization|nucleic acid hybrids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strobel SA, Ortoleva-Donnelly L, Ryder SP, Cate JH, Moncoeur E | title = Complementary sets of noncanonical base pairs mediate RNA helix packing in the group I intron active site | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–6 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9437431 | doi = 10.1038/nsb0198-60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[kinase]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop AC, Shah K, Liu Y, Witucki L, Kung C, Shokat KM | title = Design of allele-specific inhibitors to probe protein kinase signaling | journal = Current Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–66 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9501066 | doi = 10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70198-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; variety of [[Metabolism|metabolic enzymes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collot J, Gradinaru J, Humbert N, Skander M, Zocchi A, Ward TR | title = Artificial metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis based on biotin-avidin | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 125 | issue = 30 | pages = 9030–1 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 15369356 | doi = 10.1021/ja035545i }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häring D, Distefano MD | title = Enzymes by design: chemogenetic assembly of transamination active sites containing lysine residues for covalent catalysis | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11353536 | doi = 10.1021/bc000117c }}&lt;/ref&gt; and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strader CD, Gaffney T, Sugg EE, Candelore MR, Keys R, Patchett AA, Dixon RA | title = Allele-specific activation of genetically engineered receptors | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 266 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1670767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coward P, Wada HG, Falk MS, Chan SD, Meng F, Akil H, Conklin BR | title = Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 352–7 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9419379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.1.352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0223-5234(99)80094-4 |title=Engineering a region of bulk tolerance in the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=441–447 |year=1999 |last1=Westkaemper |first1=Richard B |last2=Hyde |first2=Edward G |last3=Choudhary |first3=Mohammad S |last4=Khan |first4=Naseem |last5=Gelbar |first5=Edward I |last6=Glennon |first6=Richard A |last7=Roth |first7=Bryan L | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DREADDs are the most common [[G protein–coupled receptor|GPCRs]] used in chemogenetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth BL | title = DREADDs for Neuroscientists | journal = Neuron | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 683–94 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26889809 | pmc = 4759656 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors solely get activated by the drug of interest (inert molecule) and influence physiological and neural processes that take place within and outside of the central nervous system.

Chemogenetics has recently been favored over Optogenetics, and it avoids some of the challenges of Optogenetics. Chemogenetics does not require the expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in Optogenetic declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases.These factors, therefore, don’t allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. Chemogenetics, however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery KL, Yeh AJ, Ho JS, Tsao V, Mohan Iyer S, Grosenick L, Ferenczi EA, Tanabe Y, Deisseroth K, Delp SL, Poon AS | title = Wirelessly powered, fully internal optogenetics for brain, spinal and peripheral circuits in mice | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 969–74 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26280330 | pmc = 5507210 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GPCRs' usage and chemogenetics are nowadays the targets for many of the pharmaceutical companies to cure and alleviate symptoms of diseases that involve all tissues of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith RS, Hu R, DeSouza A, Eberly CL, Krahe K, Chan W, Araneda RC | title = Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 30 | pages = 10773–85 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26224860 | pmc = 4518052 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, DREADDs have been used to explore treatment options for various neurodegenerative and psychological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, anxiety, and addiction. These aforementioned conditions involve processes that occur within and outside of the nervous system involving neurotransmitters such as [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[Glutamic acid|Glutamate]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Koob GF, McLellan AT | title = Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 374 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26816013 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1511480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemogenetics has therefore been used in pharmacology to adjust the levels of such neurotransmitters in specific neuron while minimizing the side effects of treatment. To treat and relieve the symptoms of any disease using the DREADDs, these receptors are delivered to the area of interest via viral transduction.

Recently some studies have considered using a new method called retro DREADDs. This method allows specific neuronal pathways to be studied under cellular resolution. Unlike classic DREADDs, this method is usually used in wild type animals, and these receptors are given to the targeted cells via injection of two viral vectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Animal Models ===
DREADDS have been used in many animal models (e.g., mice and other non-primate animals) to target and influence the activity of various cells . Chemogenetics used in animals assists with demonstrating human disease models such as [[Parkinson's disease]]. Having this information allows scientists understand whether viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function can be used to bidirectionally affect the behaviors and the activity of the involved neurons. Recent studies have shown that DREADDs were successfully used to treat the motor deficits of rats modeling Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pienaar IS, Gartside SE, Sharma P, De Paola V, Gretenkord S, Withers D, Elson JL, Dexter DT | title = Pharmacogenetic stimulation of cholinergic pedunculopontine neurons reverses motor deficits in a rat model of Parkinson's disease | journal = Molecular Neurodegeneration | volume = 10 | pages = 47 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26394842 | pmc = 4580350 | doi = 10.1186/s13024-015-0044-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have had successes linking the usage of DREADDs and influencing drug seeking and drug sensitization behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The progression of Chemogenetics from rodents to non-human primates has been slow due to increased demand in time and expense surrounding these projects.However, some recent studies in 2016 have been able to demonstrate successes showing that silencing the activity of neurons in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] along with the removal of [[Rhinal cortex]], restricted the reward task performance in macaques.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galvan A, Caiola MJ, Albaugh DL | title = Advances in optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to study brain circuits in non-human primates | journal = Journal of Neural Transmission | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 547–563 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28238201 | pmc = 5572535 | doi = 10.1007/s00702-017-1697-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitation and future directions ==
Chemogenetics and usage of DREADDs have allowed researchers to advance in biomedical research areas including many [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] and psychiatric conditions. Chemogenetics have been used in these fields to induce specific and reversible brain lesions and therefore, study specific activities of neuron population. Although Chemogenetics offers specificity and high spatial resolution, it still faces some challenges when used in investigating [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually have a complex nature where lesions in the brain have not been identified as the main cause. Chemogenetics has been used to reverse some of the deficits revolving such conditions however, it hasn’t been able to identify the main cause of neuropsychiatric diseases and cure these conditions completely due to complex nature of these conditions. Nevertheless, chemogenetics has been used successfully in a preclinical model of drug-resistant [[Gene therapy for epilepsy|epilepsy]], where seizures arise from a discrete part of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kätzel D, Nicholson E, Schorge S, Walker MC, Kullmann DM | title = Chemical-genetic attenuation of focal neocortical seizures | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 3847 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24866701 | pmc = 4050272 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms4847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm Problems of War and Strategy]''. 1938. (''See also: [[q:Mao Zedong|Wikiquote: Mao Zedong]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

England.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Admiral [[John B. Nathman]] (far right) and Admiral [[William J.

A subordinate of the ''civilian'' [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the Secretary of the Navy is the ''civilian'' Head of the [[Department of the Navy]], which includes the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].]]
Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''decline in amphibian populations''' is an ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[amphibian]] species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including [[Population decline|population crashes]] and mass localized [[extinction]]s, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]], and several causes are believed to be involved, including [[disease]], [[habitat destruction]] and modification, exploitation, [[pollution]], [[pesticide]] use, [[introduced species]], and [[ultraviolet-B]] radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research.

Although scientists began observing reduced populations of several European amphibian species already in the 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus recognized as one of the most severe examples of the [[Holocene extinction]], with severe implications for global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightening statistics - Amphibian Ark|url=http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/frightening-statistics/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{wikinews|Largest mass extinction in 65 million years underway, scientists say}}
In the past three decades, declines in populations of amphibians (the [[Class (biology)|class]] of organisms that includes [[frogs]], [[toads]], [[salamanders]], [[newts]], and [[caecilians]]) have occurred worldwide. In 2004, the results were published of the first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations, the Global Amphibian Assessment. This found that 32% of species were globally threatened, at least 43% were experiencing some form of population decrease, and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stuart |first1=Simon N. |last2=Chanson |first2=Janice S. |last3=Cox |first3=Neil A. |last4=Young |first4=Bruce E. |last5=Rodrigues |first5=Ana S.

Habitat loss, disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for the drastic decline in populations in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation International - Amphibians|url=http://www.conservation.org/learn/biodiversity/species/profiles/amphibians/Pages/overview.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Declines have been particularly intense in the western [[United States]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], eastern [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] (although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world's biodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of both [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] ([[larva]]e) and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] ([[adult]]) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environmental]] effects.  Because their skins are highly permeable, they may be more susceptible to [[toxins]] in the environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals.&lt;ref name="onethird"&gt;''Science Daily'' (October 15, 2004), [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041015103700.htm Amphibians in dramatic decline: Study finds nearly one third of species threatened with extinction]. Sciencedaily.com. Retrieved on September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as "[[Animal sentinel#Historical examples|canaries in a coal mine]]," and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk.&lt;ref name="onethird"/&gt;

Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, when a large gathering of [[herpetology|herpetologists]] reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe.&lt;ref name="blaustein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blaustein | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Wake | first2 = D.B. | year = 1990 | title = Declining amphibian populations: a global phenomenon? | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 203–204 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(90)90129-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these species, the [[Golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes'') [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]], featured prominently.  It was the subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crump | first1 = M.L. | last2 = Hensley | first2 = F.R. | last3 = Clark | first3 = K.I. | year = 1992 | title = Apparent decline of the golden toad: Underground or extinct? | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1992 | issue = | pages = 413–420 | doi=10.2307/1446201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (''[[Atelopus varius]]''), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Alan Pounds |author2=Martha L.

== Initial skepticism ==
When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s, some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pechmann | first1 = J.H.K. | last2 = Scott | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Semlitsch | first3 = R.D. | last4 = Caldwell | first4 = J.P. | last5 = Vitt | first5 = L.J. | last6 = Gibbons | first6 = J.W. | year = 1991 | title = Declining amphibian populations: the problem of separating human impacts from natural fluctuations | url = | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5022| pages = 892–895 | doi=10.1126/science.253.5022.892 | pmid=17751826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturally vary through time.  They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, since this initial skepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref name="stuart" /&gt; This consensus emerged with an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houlahan | first1 = J.E. | last2 = Findlay | first2 = C.S. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = B.R. | last4 = Meyer | first4 = A.H. | last5 = Kuzmin | first5 = S.L. | year = 2000 | title = Quantitative evidence for global amphibian population declines | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 404 | issue = | pages = 752–758 | doi = 10.1038/35008052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential causes ==
Numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed.  Most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians.  These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur.  The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.

Artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbeis, G., 2006.

=== Habitat modification ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
[[Habitat]] modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7693381.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate link to amphibian decline | date=2008-10-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat fragmentation ===
{{Main|Habitat fragmentation}}
Habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields.  Small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to [[inbreeding]], [[genetic drift]], or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Pollution and chemical contaminants ===
There is evidence of chemical [[pollutant]]s causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The complexity of deformed amphibians|author1=Blaustein, Andrew R|author2=Pieter TJ Johnson|journal=Front.

While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including [[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grossi, Mark |title=Sierra Frogs Fall Silent|journal=The Fresno Bee|date=24 July 2001|url = http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html|accessdate=2008-10-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618083908/http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied, with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals representing authors from North America, Europe and Australia.

There is considerable evidence that parasitic [[trematode]] [[platyhelminth]]s (a type of [[Trematoda|fluke]]) have contributed to developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = P.T.J. | last2 = Chase | first2 = J.M. | year = 2004 | title = Parasites in the food web: linking amphibian malformations and aquatic eutrophication | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 521–526 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00610.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These trematodes of the genus ''[[Ribeiroia]]'' have a complex life cycle with three host species.  The first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails.  The early larval stages of the trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles, where the metacercariae (larvae) encyst in developing limb buds.  These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs.&lt;ref name="blaustein" /&gt;  These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of the trematode.

A study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aquatic eutrophication promotes pathogenic infection in amphibians|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707763104|year=2007|volume=104|issue=40  |pages=15781–15786|author1=Johnson PTJ |author2=Jonathan M.

==== Chytridiomycosis ====
[[File:Chytridiomycosis.jpg|thumb|left|A chytrid-infected frog]]
{{Main|Chytridiomycosis}}
In 1998, following large-scale frog deaths in Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas came up with identical results: a previously undescribed species of [[pathogenic]] fungus, ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]''.&lt;ref name="Lips"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lips|first=K. R.|author2=Brem, F. |author3=Brenes, R. |author4=Reeve, J. D. |author5=Alford, R. A. |author6=Voyles, J. |author7=Carey, C. |author8=Livo, L. |author9=Pessier, A. P. |author10= Collins, J.

The disease caused by ''Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'' is called chytridiomycosis.  Frogs infected by this disease generally show skin lesions and [[hyperkeratosis]], and it is believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance, electrolyte [[homeostasis]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and role as a barrier to infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chytridiomycosis in Native Arizona Frogs|author1=Gregory A.

Subsequent research has established that the fungus has been present in Australia since at least 1978, and present in North America since at least the 1970s.  The first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''.
Because ''Xenopus'' are sold in pet shops and used in laboratories around the world, it is possible that the chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.&lt;ref name="Weldon et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Ché|author2=du Preez, Louis H. |author3=Hyatt, Alex D. |author4=Muller, Reinhold |author5=Speare, Rick |title=Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2004|volume=10|issue=12|pages=2100–2105|doi=10.3201/eid1012.030804|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/12/03-0804_article.htm|pmid=15663845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduced predators ===
{{Main|Introduced species}}
Non-native predators and competitors have also been found to affect the viability of frogs in their habitats.  The [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] which typically inhabits the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish ([[trout]]) for recreational [[fishing]].  The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. This interference in the frog's three-year [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knapp | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Matthews | first2 = K. R. | year = 2000 | title = Non-native fish introductions and the decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog from within protected areas | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 428–438 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased noise levels ===
Frogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the use of vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased [[ambient noise level]]s were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others.&lt;ref name="Anthropogenic sounds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jennifer W.C.|author2=Narins, Peter M.|title=Anthropogenic sounds differentially affect amphibian call rate|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2005|volume=121|issue=3|pages=419–427|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.05.017|url=https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/Faculty/Narins/publications/pdfs/Sun%20and%20Narins%20BC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.

== Symptoms of stressed populations ==
Amphibian populations in the beginning stages of decline often exude a number of signs, which may potentially be used to identify at-risk segments in conservation efforts.  One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress.&lt;ref name=Alfordetal2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=Ross A.|author2=Bradfield, Kay S. |author3=Richards, Stephen J. |title=Ecology: Global warming and amphibian losses|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=E3–E4|doi=10.1038/nature05940|url=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/16656/1/16656.pdf|pmid=17538571}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and thus lead to amphibian declines.  In a study conducted in [[Queensland]], Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, ''[[Litoria nannotis]]'' and ''[[Litoria genimaculata]]'', were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.

== Conservation measures ==
{{See also|Amphibian Ark}}
On 16 February 2007, scientists worldwide met in [[Atlanta]], [[United States|U.S.]], to form a group called the [[Amphibian Ark]] to help save more than 6,000 species of amphibians from disappearing by starting [[captive breeding]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | title = Bid to save frogs from killer goes worldwide | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018180029/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | archivedate = 2015-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation efforts have been created by several organizations such as Amphibian Conservation Alliance (ACA) and the World Wildlife Fund to help further studies on frog extinction and educate people on the issue at hand.

Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, have few policies that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species.  However, local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving the frogs. In South America, where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frogs.org/index.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219121411/http://www.frogs.org/index.asp |date=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverzoo.org/conservation/project46 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical issue is how to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts through the use of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amphibians, Reptiles, and their Conservation|last = Crump|first = M.|publisher = Linnet Books|year = 2002|isbn = |location = North Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.

Education of local people to protect amphibians is crucial, along with legislation for local protection and limiting the use of toxic chemicals, including some fertilizers and pesticides in sensitive amphibian areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians (2 ed.)|last = Halliday, Adler|publisher = Oxford University Pres|year = 2008|isbn = 9780198525073|location = Online|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Rêve d'un flagellant by George Topfer.jpg|thumb|200px|This 1921 illustration of a [[clothed male, naked female]] shows an example of [[female submission]]. The art is by Georges Topfer from his work ''Le Rêve d’un flagellant'' ("The dream of a flagellant").]]

'''Dominance and submission''' (also called '''D/s''') is a set of behaviours, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. It is a subset of [[BDSM]].

Physical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into [[sadomasochism]]. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called [[dominant (BDSM)|dominants]]—Doms (male) or Dommes (female)—while those who take the subordinate position are called [[submissive (BDSM)|submissives]]—or subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. A [[dominatrix]] is usually a female [[sex worker]] who dominates others for pay.

It is common for writers to capitalise the "D" in Dominant but leave the "s" in lowercase for the submissive. Many extend this to His/Hers, Him/Her, He/She, etc., to make it clear when they are referring to a Dominant.

==Overview==
The inner conflict and surrender connected with dominance and submission are enduring themes in human [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include mutual exploration of roles, emotions, and activities that would be difficult or impossible to act out without a willing partner taking an opposing role.

A 1985 study suggests that only about 30 percent of participants in [[BDSM]] activities are females.&lt;ref&gt;Breslow N, Evans L, Langley J. "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m7276ut047xg5316/ On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: report of an empirical study.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1985 Aug;14(4):303-17. {{PMID|4051718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene E. Levitt, Charles Moser, and Karen V. Jamison "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7993186 The prevalence and some attributes of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: A second report.]" [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] 23(4) / August, 1994 DOI 10.1007/BF01541410 {{PMID|7993186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study indicates that 89% of [[heterosexual]] females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive-recipient role in [[sexual bondage]], expressing also a preference for a [[Male dominance (BDSM)|dominant male]], and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.&lt;ref&gt;Ernulf KE, Innala SM. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8572912 Sexual bondage: a review and unobtrusive investigation.]" Archives of Sexual Behavior 1995 Dec;24(6):631-54. {{PMID|8572912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[safeword]]'' is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. The safeword is especially important when engaging in verbal [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]] or playing "mind-games", because the dominant may not be aware of an emotional boundary until it is crossed. If an emotional boundary is breached and the safeword spoken, the dominant should cease all play immediately and discuss the emotional breach with the submissive in a tender and understanding manner. Negotiating limits in advance is also an important element in a D/s relationship.

It is important to note that for a safe, sane, and consensual environment to be maintained, all participants should have a safeword of which the other is aware; this includes the Dominant partner. While it may not seem so from the outside, Dominants will also have limits and boundaries of their own, and should not only have a safeword but also be comfortable calling it if their own limits are exceeded. This includes cases where the dominant may feel things have gone too far and is uncomfortable continuing. As with any other participant, the dominant's safeword call should herald the stopping of all play and the start of a recuperative discussion between the participants.

D/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]], and needs in order to find commonality.  A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous.  Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible.

Based on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:-

* [[Male dominance (BDSM)|Male dominance]]
* [[Male submission]]
* [[Female dominance]]
* [[Female submission]]

==Terminology==
{{Main article|Glossary of BDSM}}
[[File:Folsom Street Fair master and 2 slaves.jpg|thumb|A dominant male publicly holds two submissive females using [[leash|leashes]] tied to their neck, [[Folsom Street Fair]], 2010]]

D/s participants often refer to their activity as "play", with an individual play session being called a "scene". In addition to "dominant" and "submissive", a "switch" is a person who can take either role. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms "top" and "bottom" refer to the active ([[Agent (grammar)|agent]]) and passive ([[Patient (grammar)|patient]]) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case.

The term "vanilla" refers to normative ("non-[[Kink (sexuality)|kinky]]") sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the "default" flavor.

===Linguistic conventions===
Some people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about.

Also, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as "this slave" or "Master Bob's girl". This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during "play". It may have roots in the [[military]], where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as "this recruit", rather than "I" or "me".

==D/s relationship styles==
{{ref improve section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Facesitting-facesitting--Couple--domination--2 large (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Face sitting]] can be a way of expressing dominance.]]
[[File:Fucking Machines top banner cropped to machine example.jpg|thumb|A [[sex machine]] being used on a woman]]

[[File:Bling-bling - table.jpg|thumb|[[Human furniture]]: A nude submissive woman being used as a decorative table. She is required to stay in the same posture, such that the [[vase]] over her does not fall.]]

There can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be [[monogamous]] or [[polyamorous]]. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste.

[[Fantasy role play]] can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. [[Human pony|Animal play]], where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play.

A classic example of a D/s role is the [[Feminization (activity)|"sissy" maid]], where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs [[stereotype|stereotypical]] female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. It should be noted that cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a "girlfriend-to-girlfriend" non-sexual basis.

Variation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include:
* domestic [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or consensual [[Slave (BDSM)|slavery]]
* enforced [[chastity]] of the submissive
* [[erotic humiliation]]
* [[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sexual slavery]]
* verbal humiliation
* fetishes—such as shoe or boot worship, uniforms, smoking, latex, and heavy rubber—are, among other activities, considered part of BDSM
* dehumanization (pony or [[animal roleplay]])
* objectification ([[human furniture]]): ex. submissive's body used as [[footstool]], or sub's mouth used as [[Spittoon|spitting bowl]] and cigarette [[ashtray]]
* [[cross-dressing]]
* [[Flagellation|whipping]]
* [[corporal punishment]]
* [[trampling]]
* human toilet - [[golden showers]]
* [[feminization (activity)|feminization]]
* [[cuckold]]
* [[bondage (sexual)]]
* [[public humiliation]]

==Safety==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

There are some risks commonly associated with D/s.  Because it is mostly a mental activity, many of the risks associated with D/s involve mental health. Others involve abuses of the trust inherent in a D/s relationship.  Some examples are:
* Physically or mentally abusive dominant partner
* Self-hating subs
* Dominant partners who violate the trust relationship by attempting to isolate the sub from society or monetarily exploit the sub

==Consent and contracts==
{{details|topic=when consent can be a defense to criminal liability for any injuries caused, and when, for these purposes, non-physical injuries are included in the definition of [[grievous bodily harm]]|Consent (BDSM)|Consent (criminal){{!}}Legal consent}}
{{See also|Contract (BDSM)}}

'''Consent''' is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a "Dungeon negotiation form", for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content.

'''Consensual non-consensuality''' is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been [[waiver|waived]] within [[safe, sane and consensual|safe, sane]] limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities.

It's not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it's common to draft a "scene contract" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It's a good way to work out what all the parties want, and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more.

For long term consent, a "slave contract" may be drawn up. BDSM "contracts" are only an agreement between consenting people and are usually not legally binding; in fact, the possession of one may be considered illegal in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; Slave contracts are simply a way of defining the nature and limits of the relationship and are not intended to carry legal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael |title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationhip Handbook |date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975|pages=162–171 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a "collaring ceremony", in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual.

==Equipment and accessories==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

Some people maintain a special room or area, called a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], which contains special equipment ([[shackle]]s, [[handcuffs]], [[whip]]s, [[queening stool]]s, and [[spanking bench]]es or a [[Berkley horse]], for example) used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities.

===Collars===
{{Main article|Collar (BDSM)}}

[[Image:BDSM collar back.jpg|thumb|A typical D/s "slave collar"]]

Many submissives wear a collar to denote their status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs wear a "symbolic collar", often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Makai |first1=Michael|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013 |publisher=Createspace |isbn=1492775975 |pages=152–161 |language=English |chapter=Chapter 6: The Collar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dog collars are integral for K-9 [[Human animal roleplay|roleplaying]]—[[pup-play]].

Many people—for example, some in the [[punk rock]] and [[goth subculture]]s—wear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the [[furry fandom]] may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences.

==Literature==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

One of the most famous works in this area is [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]'s ''Venus im Pelz'' (''Venus in Furs'', 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term "masochism" coined by the 19th century psychiatrist [[Krafft-Ebing]].

The [[Rolling Stones]] song "[[Under my Thumb]]" (M. Jagger, 1966) is supposedly about a D/s relationship.

The [[Green Day]] song "All By Myself/Dominated Love Slave" (written and sung by [[Tré Cool]]) describes Cool's feelings for female dominance.

[[Dwele]]'s "Obey" is a Neo-Soul song based on the mind of a Dominant in a D/s relationship.

Professor '''Edward Orton Jr.''' (October 8, 1863 in [[Chester (town), New York|Chester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States – February 10, 1932 in [[Columbus, Ohio]], USA) was an [[United States|American]] academic administrator, businessman, [[ceramic]] engineer, [[geologist]], and [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/433606/Edward-Orton-Jr | title=Edward Orton Jr. | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Orton Jr. is the son of Dr [[Edward Orton Sr.]], a [[Harvard]] educated geologist, and Mary Jennings Orton.  Shortly after his birth, in 1865, his family relocated to [[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], [[Ohio]], when his father became principal of the preparatory school of Antioch College.  In 1873, he began attending public school in Columbus after his father relocated the family when he was appointed first President of The [[Ohio State Agricultural and Mechanical College]].

==The Ohio State University==
Orton Jr. graduated from [[Ohio State University]] with an Engineer of Mines degree in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Edward_Orton_jr.html?id=oJdAAAAAIAAJ | title=Edward Orton, Jr: a memorial | publisher=[[Ohio State University]], Engineering Experiment Station | year=1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1884 to 1888, he was chemist and superintendent of blast furnaces. The regular manufacture of high silicon alloy of iron, “ferro-silicon,” in the United States was introduced first by him, at the Bessie Furnace, [[New Straitsville, Ohio]], 1887-88. In the latter year, he entered the ceramic industries of Ohio, managing several plants until 1893.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Orton, Edward Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Orton was appointed the first chairman of a school of [[ceramic engineering]] at Ohio State University, the first ceramic engineering school in the United States. This school for instruction in the technology of clay, glass and cement industries was established largely through his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Orton, Edward Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orton also served as the Dean of the College of [[Engineering]] from 1902 to 1906 and again from 1910 to 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/xOhCoUA0001.xml;query=;brand=default | title=Edward Orton Jr. Papers: Guide to the Collection | work=[http://www.ohiolink.edu/ OhioLINK] | accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orton honored his father with the Orton Memorial Library of Geology, inside Orton Hall at Ohio State University, for perusing the theories and records of earthly change. [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Orton Hall]] would later house the [[Orton Geological Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ortongeologicalmuseum.osu.edu/ Orton Geological Museum], School of Earth Sciences, [[The Ohio State University]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In 1916, Orton aided in the drafting of the US [[National Defense Act]].  Later that year, during [[World War I]], Orton entered the United States military service.  In 1917, he was commissioned a Major in the Officer's Reserve Corps.  By 1919, he became a Brigadier General in the Quartermaster's Officers Reserve Corp.  On June 2, 1919, he was awarded a [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] by the [[United States Congress]].

==Citizen==
Following in his father's footsteps, Orton served as the State [[Geologist]] of Ohio from 1899 until 1906.  He purchased, created and donated Camp Mary Orton (named after his first wife) to the Godman Guild of Columbus which operated it as a summer camp and retreat for young mothers and their babies. He was elected President of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce in 1921 and re-elected for a second term in 1922 (only the second citizen to succeed himself). In 1922, he received a Doctor of Science from [[Rutgers College]]. In 1931, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from [[Alfred University]]. Later in 1931, he received the professional degree of Ceramic Engineer from The Ohio State University.

==American Ceramic Society==
Orton served as the first Secretary [[American Ceramic Society]] from 1899 to 1917 and later as President during 1930–31.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Standard Pyrometric Cone Company==
Orton developed a series of [[pyrometric cone]]s and established the "Standard Pyrometric Cone Company" to manufacture the cones, which continue to be used. He died in 1932, and In accordance to his Will the [[Orton Ceramic Foundation|Edward Orton Jr. Ceramic Foundation]] was formed as a [[charitable trust]] to operate  of the "Standard Pyrometric Cone Company".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ortonceramic.com/ Orton Ceramic Foundation], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Orton married twice, first to Mary Princess Anderson (1888 until her death in 1927) and later to Mina Althea Orton (1928 until his death in 1932).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Music]] can be [[music analysis|analysed]] by considering a variety of its '''elements''', or [[property (philosophy)|parts]] (aspects, characteristics, features), individually or together. A commonly used list of the main elements includes pitch, timbre, texture, volume, duration and form. The elements of music may be compared to the [[elements of art]] or [[design elements and principles|design]].

==Selection of elements==

According to [[Howard Gardner|Howard]] {{harvtxt|Gardner|1983|loc=104}}, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration {{harv|Owen|2000|loc=6}}. Most definitions of music include a reference to sound ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}) and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive processes. They are: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]] ({{harvnb|Burton|2015|loc=22–28}}).

A '''parameter''' is any element that can be manipulated ([[musical composition|composed]]) separately from other elements or focused on separately in an educational context.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=bolded term}} [[Leonard B. Meyer]] compares distinguishing parameters within a culture by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, timbre, "etc." {{harv|Meyer|1989|loc=21n44}}. The first person to apply the term ''[[parameter]]'' to music may have been [[Joseph Schillinger]], though its relative popularity may be due to [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] {{harv|Grant|2005|loc=62n85}}. ''Gradation'' is gradual change within one parameter, or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

Meyer gives melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, "and the like" {{harv|Meyer|1973|loc=9}}, while Narmour lists, melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, "and perhaps others" {{harv|Narmour|1988|loc=326}}. According to McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time {{harv|McClellan|2000|loc=142}}. [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan P.]] {{harvtxt|Merriam|1964|loc=32–33}} proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: concept, behaviour, and sound. [[Virgil Thomson|Virgil]] {{harvtxt|Thomson|1957|loc=vii}} lists the "raw materials" of music in order of their supposed discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including [[counterpoint]] and [[orchestration]]. Near the end of the twentieth century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music&lt;!-- (see Keller and Rieger 2009)--&gt; {{harv|Moran|2013|loc=59}}. For example: [[concert|performance]], [[sociomusicology|social]], [[women in music|gender]], [[dance]], and [[musical theater|theater]].

==Definition of music==
[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of "musicality"]]
{{Main|Definition of music}}
Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? For example, [[intensional definition]]s list aspects or elements that make up their subject.

Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition ({{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Oxforddictionaries.com}}): music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. The process of [[sight-reading|reading music]], at least for trained musicians, involves a process, called "inner hearing" or "audiation" by Gordon, where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played {{harv|Gordon |1999}}. This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it may not be.

[[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=43}} points out that "any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production." Nattiez gives as examples [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Con Voce'' [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): "sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=43}}.

==Universal aspect==
{{anchor|Invariances}}{{anchor|Invariance}}
There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], as well as whether the concept of music is universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A [[pulse (music)|pulse]] is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse {{harv|Johnson|2002|loc=62}}, one example being the [[alap]] section of an [[Indian classical music]] performance. Harwood questions whether a "cross-cultural musical universal" may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, conception, and education {{harv|Harwood|1976|loc=522}}.

One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations, is that an English-language word (i.e. the word "music"), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in English language dictionaries ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Music|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}), it seems there is no agreement on what the word "Music" means in English,{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Drawing a conclusion from comparing several dictionaries is Original Research.--&gt; let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist Chinyere Nwachukwu's definition of the Igbo term "nkwa" {{harv|Nwachukwu|1981|loc=59}} as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing {{harv|Gourlay|1984|loc=35}}. He then concludes that there exists "nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic."

==Other terms==
Other terms used to discuss particular pieces include:
* [[Musical note|Note]]—an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm, or the written symbol
*[[chord (music)|Chord]]—a [[simultaneity]] of notes heard as some sort of unit
*[[Chord progression]]—a succession of chords ([[simultaneity succession]])

'''Fair Trade coffee''' is [[coffee]] that is certified as having been produced to [[fair trade]] standards.

[[Fair trade]] organizations create trading partnerships that are based on dialogue, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[respect]], that seeks greater equity in [[international trade]]. These partnerships contribute to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to [[coffee bean]] farmers.

Fair trade organizations are engaged actively in supporting producers and sustainable environmental farming practices. Fair trade practices prohibit child or forced labor.

==History==
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Prior to fair trade, prices were regulated by the [[International Coffee Organization]] according to the regulations set forth by the [[International Coffee Agreement]] of 1962. The agreement, which was negotiated at the [[United Nations]] by the Coffee Study Group, set limits on the amount of coffee traded between countries so there would be no excess supply and consequent drop in price. The ICA existed for five years, and then was renewed in 1968.

The agreement was renegotiated in 1976 due to increasing coffee prices, largely a result of a severe frost in [[Brazil]]. The new agreement allowed for the suspension of price quotas if the supply of coffee could not meet the demand, and enabling them if prices dropped too low.

In 1984, the agreement was again redrawn, this time creating a database on coffee trade, and implementing stricter import and export regulations.

[[Fair trade certification]] was then introduced in 1988 following a coffee crisis in which the supply of coffee was greater than the demand; since no price quotas had been reimplemented by the International Coffee Act, the market was flooded. Launched in the [[Netherlands]], fair trade certification aimed to artificially raise coffee prices in order to ensure growers sufficient wages to turn a profit. The original name of the organization was "[[Max Havelaar]]", after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee farmers by Dutch colonialists in the East Indies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW DID IT ACTUALLY START?|url=http://www.maxhavelaar.nl/faq/how-did-it-start?destination=english&amp;backtitle=FAQ%27s|work=FairTrade Max Havelaar Netherlands|publisher=Max Havelaar Foundation|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Max Havelaar Foundation|language=Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created a label for products that met certain wage standards.

Quotas remained a part of the agreement until 1989, when the organization was unable to negotiate a new agreement in time for the next year. It was decided that the 1983 agreement would be extended, but without the quotas because they had not yet been determined. A new agreement could not be negotiated until 1992.

From 1990 to 1992, without the quotas in place, coffee prices reached an all-time low because coffee price quotas could not be decided.

The agreements of 2001 and 2007 aimed to stabilize the coffee economy by promoting coffee consumption, raising the standard of living of growers by providing economic counselling, expanding research to include [[niche markets]] and quality relating to geographic area, and conducting studies of [[sustainability]], principles similar to fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/icohistory_e.asp|publisher=International Coffee Organization|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web |title=CERTIFICATION &amp; YOUR BUSINESS|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/certification|work=Fair Trade USA|publisher=Fair Trade USA|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Fair Trade USA|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the inception of fair trade certification, the "Transfair" label was later launched in Germany, and within ten years three other labeling organizations commenced: The [[Fairtrade Foundation]], [[TransFair USA]], and [[Rättvisemärkt]]. In 1997, these four organizations jointly created Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, or [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]]), which continues to set Fairtrade standards, inspecting and certifying growers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Fair trade organizations==

The fair trade labeling organizations having most of the market share and who sell through supermarkets refer to a definition developed by [[FINE]], an association of four international fair trade networks ([[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European World shops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA)). The standards developed by Fairtrade Labelling Organization are the most widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/standards.html|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification scheme ==

The certification scheme is run by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]].

Coffee packers pay Fairtrade a fee for the right to use the Fairtrade logo, which gives consumers an assurance that the coffee meets Fairtrade criteria. The coffee with this certification mark must be produced by farmers and cooperatives that meet these criteria.&lt;ref name="fairtrade.net"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffee retailers ==
Coffee retailers are not restricted by Fairtrade to sell Fairtrade coffee as a premium product and charge as much as they like for the coffee.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importers==

Importers of Fairtrade coffee have to be registered with Fairtrade and pay a fee. Under the Fairtrade International standards they are obliged to pay a minimum price to the exporting organization, currently $1.40c/lb New York  Board of Trade “C” contract, F.O.B. origin for Arabica, and $1.05 for Robusta London “EURONEXT LIFFE” contract, F.O.B origin with 30c/lb extra for organic.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO), “Fairtrade Minimum Price and Fairtrade Premium Table” 18.12.2012, accessed 8.1.2013; Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When the world price is above this level, they are obliged to pay 20c/lb above the world price.

==Exporters==

Certified Fairtrade coffee is normally exported by secondary or tertiary cooperatives, marketing this coffee on behalf of the cooperatives the farmers belong to&lt;ref name="Fairtrade International 2011 p 16"&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Some exporting cooperatives do not manage to sell any of their output as certified,&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"&gt;Weber, J.

The exporting cooperatives incur costs including certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs of conforming to standards, and additional costs of cooperative operation,  costs which are incurred on all coffee production, even if little or none is marketed as certified, with a higher price, so the cooperatives may make a loss on Fairtrade membership. Weber&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"/&gt; reports cooperatives not able to cover the extra costs of a marketing team for Fairtrade, with one covering only 70% of these costs after six years of Fairtrade membership.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus will normally go on “social projects” for “common goals” organized by the exporting cooperative rather than as extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== Enforcement of standards ==

FLO-CERT, a for-profit business owned by Fairtrade International, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with farmers, cooperatives, importers and packers.

== The marketing system==

The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying the normal importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand rather than doing it themselves, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fair trade organizations remain that adhere to a greater or smaller degree to the original objectives of fair trade than the mainstream of Fairtrade International and its associate. These market products through alternative channels where possible, and market through specialist fair trade shops, but they have a small proportion of the total market.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet, Jerome and Aurelie Carimentrand ‘Fair trade and the Depersonalization of Ethics’ Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 92:317–330 _ Springer 2010 DOI 10.1007/s10551-010-0576-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms ==

Criticisms of fair trade have been made as a result of independent research, and these are summarized in the [[fair trade debate]].

There are also some criticisms of fair trade specific to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee|title=The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through the rise of the [[Third wave of coffee|third wave coffee]] movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sick|first=Deborah|date=2008-08-20|title=Coffee, Farming Families, and Fair Trade in Costa Rica: New Markets, Same Old Problems?|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/245424|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=193–208|doi=10.1353/lar.0.0042|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8380592|title=Voting with your trolley|date=2006-12-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who believe fair trade coffee is insufficient utilize the [[direct trade]] model, which allows for more control over quality concerns, farmer empowerment, and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is valuable in harboring closer farmer to roaster business relationships, which can ultimately increase quality of life and profits for coffee growers and buyers alike. However, direct trade is a new concept that is only utilized by for profit businesses like Counter Culture Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee and therefore has no third party certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://counterculturecoffee.com/sustainability|title=Sustainability {{!}} Counter Culture Coffee|date=2016-08-11|work=Counter Culture Coffee|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/learn-do/community/intelligentsia-direct-trade|title=Learn &amp; Do {{!}} Community {{!}} Direct Trade {{!}} Intelligentsia Coffee|website=www.intelligentsiacoffee.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources''' ('''Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe''' or '''BGR''') is a German agency within the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]].  It acts as a central [[geoscience]] consulting institution for the [[German federal government]].&lt;ref name=BGR-Home&gt;{{cite web|title=BGR Homepage|url=http://www.bgr.bund.de/EN/Home/homepage_node_en.html|publisher=BGR|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the agency is located in [[Hanover]] and there is a branch in [[Berlin]]. Early 2013, the BGR employed a total of 795 employees. The BGR, the State Authority for Mining, Energy and Geology and the Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics form the Geozentrum Hanover. All three institutions have a common management and infrastructure, and complement each other through their interdisciplinary expertise.

'''Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria''' ([[Linz]], 14 June 1529 &amp;ndash; 24 January 1595, [[Innsbruck]]) was ruler of [[Further Austria]] including [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. The son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was married to [[Philippine Welser]] in his first marriage. In his second marriage to [[Anna Juliana Gonzaga]], he was the father of [[Anna of Tyrol]], the would-be [[Holy Roman Empress]].

==Life account==
[[Image:William Scrots 002.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke Ferdinand at a young age]][[File:New-reformierte-Landts-Ordnung-der-fürstlichen-Grafschafft-Tyrol-1573 MG 0965.tif|thumb|Engraving of Ferdinand, published in ''New Reformierte Landts-Ordnung Der Fürstlichen Graffschafft Tyrol Wie Die Auss Lands-Fürstlichem Befelch, Im 1603'']]
Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]]. He was a younger brother of Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of [[Bohemia]] in 1547. He also led the campaign against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in [[Hungary]] in 1556.

In 1557 he was secretly married to Philippine [[Welser]], daughter of a patrician from [[Augsburg]], with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name "of Austria" but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of [[Habsburg]] became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a [[morganatic marriage]]. The sons born of this marriage received the title [[Margrave of Burgau]], after the [[Margraviate of Burgau]], an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of ''Fürst zu Burgau''.

After his father's death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and other [[Further Austria]]n possessions under his father's will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in [[Prague]] until 1567 according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II.

In his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making [[Castle Ambras|Ambras Castle Innsbruck]] the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle Innsbruck represents an unrivalled cultural monument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The collection was started during Ferdinand's time in Bohemia and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incurred a high level of debt. Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. 

After the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married [[Anna Caterina Gonzaga]], a daughter of [[William I, Duke of Mantua]], in 1582.

Archduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tirol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became [[Anna of Tyrol|Holy Roman Empress Anna]], consort of [[Emperor Mathias]], who received his Further Austrian inheritance.

==Children==
[[Image:PhilippineWelser.jpg|thumb|Philippine Welser, Ferdinand's first wife]]
He and his first wife [[Philippine Welser]] were parents of four children:
*[[Margrave Andrew of Burgau]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1576.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of  19 November 1576&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (15 June 1558 – 12 November 1600). Became a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] in 1576, [[Margrave of Burgau]] in 1578, [[Bishop of Constance]] in 1589 and [[Bishop of Brixen]] in 1591. He had two illegitimate children.
*[[Charles, Margrave of Burgau]] (22 November 1560 – 30 October 1618), [[Margrave of Burgau]]. He married his first cousin, [[Sibylle of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Sibylle]] (1557–1627), the youngest daughter of daughter of [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] (28 July 1516 - 5 January 1592), and [[Maria of Hapsburg|Maria]], Archduchess of Austria, daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. They had no legitimate children. He and his mistress Chiara Elisa di Ferrero had three illegitimate children.
*Philip of Austria (7 August 1562 – 9 January 1563).
*Maria of Austria (7 August 1562 – 25 January 1563), twin of Philip.

On 14 May 1582, Ferdinand married his niece [[Anne Juliana Gonzaga|Anne Catherine]]. She was a daughter of [[William I, Duke of Mantua]], and [[Eleonora of Austria]], younger sister of Ferdinand. They were parents to three daughters:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literature.at/viewer.alo?objid=11804&amp;page=162&amp;scale=3.33&amp;viewmode=fullscreen Wurzbach: ''Anna Katherina von Mantua'', vol. 31.

It is a gateway from which [[germplasm]] accessions from [[gene bank]]s around the world can be easily found and ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.genesys-pgr.org/ |title=Genesys PGR |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Genesys |accessdate=2015-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project started in 2008 by [[Bioversity International]], the [[Global Crop Diversity Trust]] and the Secretariat of the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], "to create a single information portal to facilitate the access to, and use of, accessions in ''ex situ'' gene banks".&lt;ref name="book_halewood_2013"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Halewood |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Lopez Noriega |editor2-first=Isabel |editor3-last=Louafi |editor3-first=Selim |date=2013 |title=Crop Genetic Resources as a Global Commons: challenges in international law and governance |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781844078936/ |location=New York, USA |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781844078929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the first version of the website was launched, containing 2.3 million accession records and some three million phenotypic records for 22 [[Crop|crops]]: bananas, barley, beans, breadfruit, cassava, chickpeas, coconuts, cowpeas, faba beans, finger millet, grass peas, lentils, maize, pearl millet, pigeon peas, potatoes, rice, sorghum, sweet potatoes, taro, wheat and yams.&lt;ref name="book_halewood_2013"/&gt; It brought together data from three major networks: the European Plant Genetic Resources Search Catalogue (EURISCO), System-Wide Information Network for Genetic Resources (SINGER) from [[CGIAR]] and the US Department of Agriculture’s Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN).

In 2014, the second version of the website was launched. As of March 2015, the database listed 2.7 million accessions stored in 446 institutes from 252 countries. The source code, notably for the web server, is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bitbucket.org/genesys2/ |title=GeneSys PGR 2 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bitbucket |access-date=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4586">'''Geolinguistics''' has been identified by some as being a branch of [[linguistics]] and by others as being an offshoot of [[language geography]] which is further defined in terms of being a branch of [[human geography]]. When seen as a branch of linguistics, geolinguistics may be viewed from more than one linguistic perspective, something with research implications.

==Conservative geolinguistic perspectives==
One academic tradition with regard to geolinguistics as a branch of linguististics gives open recognition to the role map-making can play in linguistic research by seeing the terms dialect geography,&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colfa.utsa.edu/nwav39/workshops/geolx.pdf|format=PDF|title=Workshop Proposal: Geolinguistics |website=Colfa.utsa.edu|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[language geography]]&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; and linguistic geography&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; as being synonymous with geolinguistics. This identification of geolinguistics with linguistic map-making appears across a range of languages, including Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aconf.org/conf_44779.The_Third_International_Conference_on_Chinese_Geolinguistics.html|title=The Third International Conference on Chinese Geolinguistics |website=Aconf.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French, Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.doshisha.ac.jp/~cjtl210/data1/34_oonishi.pdf|format=PDF|language={{jp icon}}|title=国立国語研究所 時空間変異研究系|website=Doshisha.ac.jp|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genhis.philol.msu.ru/article_197.shtml|title=Геолингвистика |trans-title=Geolinguistics |author=S.N. Kuznetsov |website=Genhis.philol.msu.ru|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish. In German, in addition to an identification of geolinguistics with the terms Sprachgeographie (language geography) and Dialektgeographie (dialect geography), the term Areallinguistik (area linguistics) appears as also being synonymous.

==Academic societies exhibiting conservative use of the term geolinguistics==
Two important [[geolinguistic organizations]] exist whose naming and/or translation practices imply a certain recognition of the traditional importance that dialectologists have attached to the role of language map-making as a tool for linguistic analysis. They are the ''Asian Geolinguistic Society of Japan'' and, in Europe, ''The International Society for Dialectology and Geolinguistics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geo-linguistics.org|title=SIDG|website=Geo-linguistics.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An expansive geolinguistic perspective==
A second linguistic tradition is that of [[The American Society of Geolinguistics]] which interprets geolinguistics to be "An academic discipline involving the analysis and implications of the geographical location, distribution and structure of language varieties within a temporal framework, either in isolation or in contact and/or conflict with one another, being originally conceived of by Mario Pei as being a branch of linguistics which would be used to do objective-oriented research on real life language issues and where interdisciplinary approaches would be acceptable."&lt;ref name="ASG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/geolinguistics-information/mission-statement|title=Geolinguistics Information - Mission Statement|website=American Society of Geolinguistics|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Society's mission statement mentions the gathering and disseminating of "up-to-date knowledge concerning the world`s present-day languages, dialects, and other language varieties in the context of their distribution and use, their relative practical importance, their perceived usefulness and actual availability from economic, political and cultural standpoints, their genetic, historical and geographical affiliations and relationships, and their identification and use in spoken and written form".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt; It also states the Society's interest in "linguistic geography, languages in contact and conflict, language planning and policy, language education and the broader aspects of sociolinguistics".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt;

[[File:2008-02-16 Mongolian gerbil.jpg|thumb|right|Gerbils are the most common rodents to be allegedly inserted.]]
__NOTOC__
'''Gerbilling''', also known as '''gerbil stuffing''' or '''gerbil shooting''', is a rumoured [[human sexual behavior|sexual practice]] of inserting small live animals (usually [[gerbil]]s but also [[mouse|mice]], [[hamster]]s, [[rat]]s and various other [[rodents]]) into the human [[rectum]] to obtain stimulation. Some variations of reports suggest that the rodent be covered in a psychoactive substance such as cocaine prior to being inserted.

==Overview==
According to folklorist [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], accounts of gerbilling were first recorded in 1984 and initially were said to involve a mouse and an unidentified man. In subsequent versions of the story, the animal was a gerbil and the story applied to several male celebrities.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/risque/homosex/gerbil.asp |title=From Gere to eternity |date=2001-11-18|author=Barbara and David P.

As of the mid-1980s, there were no reports in peer-reviewed medical literature describing gerbilling among the variety of [[rectal foreign object]]s removed from people's bodies.&lt;ref name="Straight_Dope"&gt;Adams, Cecil (1986). "[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/478/is-it-true-what-they-say-about-gerbils Is It True What they Say About Gerbils?]" ''The Straight Dope'', March 28, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Mike Walker, a ''[[National Enquirer]]'' gossip columnist, spent months attempting to verify the gerbilling rumors about [[Richard Gere]]. "I've never worked harder on a story in my life," Walker told the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' in 1995. After much investigation, he was unable to find any evidence that a gerbilling incident ever happened: "I'm convinced that it's nothing more than an urban legend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L.A. Exposed: Strange Myths and Curious Legends in the City of Angels|last1=Young|first1=Paul|page=20|publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0312206468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Savage]], a sex-advice columnist who frequently discusses unusual sexual practices, stated in 2013 that he has never received a first-hand or even a second-hand account of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=16295662 |title=Gerbils?

According to the editors of [[Snopes.com]], gerbilling is an unverified and persistent urban legend.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
A very prominent mention of gerbilling occurred on mainstream TV in the episode "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", the fourteenth episode of the [[South Park (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 20, 2002. Finally promoted to teaching fourth graders, [[Mr. Garrison]] realizes that getting fired for being [[homosexuality|homosexual]] could allow him to sue the school for millions. He decides to perform outrageous sex acts in the classroom, hiring his partner [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Mr. Slave|Mr. Slave]] as his teaching assistant. Though the children complain about Garrison's inappropriate activities, their parents mistakenly think their children are intolerant of homosexuality. Garrison, annoyed that no one has complained about his actions, steps up his campaign to get fired by shoving "Lemmiwinks", the class gerbil, into Mr. Slave's [[rectum]], as an act of gerbilling.

In the song "Fack" from his 2005 album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'', rapper [[Eminem]] recites a verse about gerbilling. "Now see that gerbil, grab that tube/stick it up my butt/let that little rascal nibble on my asshole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/the-50-grossest-rap-lyrics/eminem-fack/ Top 50 Grossest Rap Lyrics] [[Complex.com]] (03/27/2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  

A February 2015 episode of ''[[Family Feud]]'' featured a woman who immediately answered "a gerbil" when host [[Steve Harvey]] asked "Name something a doctor would pull out of a person." The response produced prolonged laughter from the audience and a stunned silence from Harvey; even the other contestant at the podium burst out laughing over her response. The clip of the scene from the episode quickly went [[Viral video|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox13now.com/2015/02/12/she-said-what-possibly-the-most-awkward-answer-ever-shouted-on-game-show/ She said what? Possibly the most awkward answer ever shouted on game show] [[KSTU]] (02/12/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel [[American Psycho]] the protagonist inserts a rat into the vagina of a woman he later murders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10640">A relationship between '''handedness and sexual orientation''' has been suggested by a number of researchers, who report that heterosexual individuals are somewhat more likely to be right-handed than are homosexual individuals.

The relationship between [[handedness]] and [[sexual orientation]] has been suggested within both sexes and may reflect the biological [[etiology]] of [[sexual orientation]]; work by [[Ray Blanchard]] has linked the relationship to the [[fraternal birth order effect]], which suggests that a man with several older biological brothers is more likely to be homosexual. The theory is still tentative and not all research has been able to confirm the disparity between homosexual and heterosexual men.

== Studies ==

=== Lalumière et al., 2000 meta-analysis ===
Lalumière et al. conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 20 studies with a total of 6,987 homosexual and 16,423 heterosexual participants. They found that homosexual men had a 34% greater odds of non-right-handedness, and homosexual women had a 91% greater odds (39% overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lalumière, M.

=== Williams et al., 2000 ===
In a study involving 382 men—278 homosexual and 104 heterosexual—no significant association emerged between handedness and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Finger-length ratios and sexual orientation|url=https://www.msu.edu/~breedsm/pdf/breedlove2000.pdf|year=2000|author1=Terrance J.

=== Mustanski et al., 2002 study ===

Mustanski et al. examined sexual orientation and hand preference in a sample of 382 men (205 heterosexual; 177 homosexual) and 354 women (149 heterosexual; 205 homosexual). Although a significantly higher proportion of [[Lesbian|homosexual women]] was found to be left-handed compared to heterosexual women (18% vs 10%), no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual men with respect to hand preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Lippa, 2003 study ===

Lippa examined sexual orientation and handedness in a sample of 812 men (351 heterosexual; 461 homosexual) and 1189 women (707 heterosexual; 472 homosexual). Homosexual men were 82% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual men, but no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual women in terms of handedness.  When combining men and women into one large sample, homosexual individuals were 50% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Blanchard et al., 2006 study ===

Blanchard et al. argued that the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] (the probability that a boy will be homosexual increases with the number of older brothers who have the same biological mother) appears to be limited to right-handed men. Moreover, the same study indicates that left-handed men without older brothers are more likely to be homosexual than non-right-handed men who have older brothers.  As Blanchard et al. said in their report, "the odds of homosexuality is higher for men who have a non-right hand preference or who have older brothers, relative to men with neither of these features, but the odds for men with both features are similar to the odds for men with neither".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== BBC survey ===
In a multinational online survey, it was found that gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed (13 and 11%, respectively) than heterosexual men and women (11% and 10%, respectively). Bisexuals of both sexes more often described themselves as ambidextrous than gay or heterosexual individuals of the same sex (bisexual men: 12%; gay and heterosexual men: 8%; bisexual women: 16%; lesbians: 12%; heterosexual women: 8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/articles/results/handedness.shtml|title=BBC – Science &amp; Nature – Sex ID – Study Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bogaert, 2007 study ===
In a study of 373 heterosexual and 538 gay or bisexual men, a link was found between non-heterosexual orientation and extreme right-handedness, but not left-handedness.&lt;ref name=boga&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anthony Bogaert|year=2007|journal=Neuropsychology|title=Extreme right-handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation in men.|volume=21|issue=1|pages=141–8|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.1.141|pmid=17201537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' study ===

A subsequent study by Blanchard found that both right-handed homosexual men and left-handed heterosexual men had a statistically significant number of older male siblings, but that there was no significant observable effect for right-handed heterosexual men ''or'' for left-handed homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Laterality'' study ===

Blanchard discussed ways in which the [[fraternal birth order effect]] and handedness could be explained in terms of the maternal immune hypothesis. In this, the mother is assumed to grow more immune to male [[antigens]] with each pregnancy, and thus produce a greater number of "anti-male" [[antibodies]]. He suggests two possibilities; that non-right-handed fetuses are less sensitive to the antibodies, or that the mothers of left-handed fetuses do not, for some reason, produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Schwartz et al., 2010 hair whorl study ===
In a sample including 694 gay men and 894 straight men, it was found that 13.9% of gay men and 15.9% of straight men were non-right handed, a non-significant difference. The study replicated the older brother effect for homosexual men, but unlike Blanchard 2006 (see above), it found that the effect applied to both right-handed and left-handed gay men, being in effect stronger for the latter than for the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gene Schwartz et al.|year=2010|journal=Arch Sex Behav|volume=39|pages=93–109|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9499-1|title=Biodemographic and Physical Correlates of Sexual Orientation in Men|pmid=19387815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kishida and Rahman, 2015 ===

=== Asexuality ===

A 2014 Internet study attempted to analyze the relationship between self-identification as [[asexuality|asexual]], handedness and other biological markers, in comparison to individuals of other sexual orientation groups. A total of 325 asexuals (60 men and 265 women), 690 heterosexuals (190 men and 500 women), and 268 non-heterosexuals (64 men and 204 women) completed online questionnaires. The study asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be non-right-handed than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yule MA, Brotto LA, Gorzalka BB |title=Biological markers of asexuality: Handedness, birth order, and finger length ratios in self-identified asexual men and women.|website=Arch Sex Behav|year=2014|pmid=24045903|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0175-0|volume=43|pages=299–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of glass-making''' dates back to at least 3600 years ago in [[Mesopotamia]]. However, they may have been producing second-rate copies of glass objects from [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where this complex craft originated.&lt;ref name="Egyptglass"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassmaking-may-have-begun-egypt-not-mesopotamia |title=Glassmaking may have begun in Egypt, not Mesopotamia Artifacts from Iraq site show less sophisticated technique, color palette |accessdate=2016-11-25 |date=2016-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt.&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |title=Glass Online: The History of Glass |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415194738/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known glass objects, of the mid second millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA|True glazing over a ceramic body was not used until many centuries after the production of the first glass.}} Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|late Bronze Age]] civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt.

From across the former [[Roman Empire]] archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and [[funerary]] contexts.
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.

==Origins==
[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia 2 retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Berlin glass amphora from Olbia|glass amphora]] from the [[Hellenistic period]].]]
Naturally occurring [[glass]], especially the [[volcanism|volcanic]] glass [[obsidian]], has been used by many [[Stone Age]] societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]] or [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"/&gt; Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Vitrification|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Compacted oxide layer glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA}}

During the [[Late Bronze Age]] in [[Egypt]] (e.g., the [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep "Treasure"]]) and [[Western Asia]] (e.g., [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]),&lt;ref&gt;These early examples are drawn from {{cite journal|author=Christine Lilyquist|title=Granulation and Glass: Chronological and Stylistic Investigations at Selected Sites, ca. 2500-1400 B.C.E.|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=290/291 |year=1993|issue=290|pages=29–94|jstor=1357319}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a rapid growth in [[glassmaking]] technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass [[ingots]], vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized [[hardstone carvings]] in [[Gemstone|semi-precious stones]]) and the ubiquitous beads. The [[alkali]] of Syrian and Egyptian glass was [[soda ash]] ([[sodium carbonate]]), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably [[halophile]] seashore plants like [[saltwort]]. The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings.

Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of [[oxide]]s were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth ([[marver]]ed) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for [[inlay]]s were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, H. "Technologische Innovationen im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr. Zur Verwendung und Verbreitung neuer Werkstoffe im ostmediterranen Raum". GOF IV, Bd 44, Wiesbaden 2003, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in [[Western Asia]], [[Crete]], and [[Egypt]]; and the [[Mycenaean Greek]] term {{lang|gmy|𐀓𐀷𐀜𐀺𐀒𐀂}}, ''ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i'', meaning "workers of [[lapis lazuli]] and glass" (written in [[Linear b]] [[syllabic script]]) is attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16799|title=The Linear B word ku-wa-no-wo-ko|website=Palaeolexicon.

It is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded [[trade secret|technological secret]] reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the [[Ulu Burun]] [[shipwreck]] off the coast of modern [[Turkey]].

[[File:Lubaczów Goblet with coats of arms.jpg|thumb|An early 18th-century goblet with coats of arms in the District Museum in [[Tarnów]] is one of the highest (54.3 cm, 21.4 in) preserved examples of artistry of less known [[Lubaczów]] glass manufacturing factory.&lt;ref name=malopolska/&gt; The goblet was almost entirely covered with a pattern of so-called carp scales and hand-engraved decoration.&lt;ref name=malopolska/&gt;]]

Glass remained a luxury material, and the [[Bronze Age collapse|disasters]] that overtook [[Late Bronze Age]] civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking "manual" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in [[cuneiform]] tablets discovered in the library of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]. In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Alexandria]]. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the [[Hellenistic]] period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' [[viscous]] (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and '[[millefiori]]' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas, R. W.|title=A history of glassmaking|publisher=G T Foulis &amp; Co Ltd|place=Henley-on-Thames|year=1972|isbn=0-85429-117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Phoenicia]]n traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the [[Belus River]]. [[Georgius Agricola]], in ''[[De re metallica]]'', reported a traditional serendipitous "discovery" tale of familiar type:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with [[nitre|nitrum]] being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass."&lt;ref name=Agricola&gt;[[Georg Agricola|Agricola, Georgius]], ''[[De re metallica]]'', translated by Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, Dover Publishing. [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/agricola-metallica/page_001 De Re Metallica Trans. by Hoover Online Version] [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/agricola-metallica/page_621 Page 586]. Retrieved September 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC [[glass blowing]] was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry.  Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world.{{Citation needed|reason=no source for glass use in Roman world|date=December 2010}} Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria{{Citation needed|reason=no source for Jewish glassblowers|date=December 2010}} spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of [[manganese dioxide]]), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.

==History by culture==
===Iran===
The first Persian glass was discovered in the explorations of Dinkhahtepe in Azarbaijan by Burny.  It was glass bead from the late Bronze Age (1600 B.C.).  Then in the middle Elam era of Chogha, Zanbil Temple existed. Many glass tubes were discovered by French teams.  Today it is certain that the mosaic glass cups from the Iron Age of North Iran, such as Hassnlou Tepe, Marlik Tepe. It resembles a number of Mesopotamian examples, in Susa of late Elam, a few glass vessels were discovered, of core forming technique.  Also in Azarbaijan and Kordestan, the Gilan provinces, a few kohl tubes were discovered from the late Iron Age that continued into the Achamenid period. In this time achamind bowls and colorless glass growing on empair but in selukid and parthian times helleni and roman techniques were Prevalented and Sassanian era seem local motives on glass vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{salehvand,2016}}=title= the history of glass and glass making, glassware of Arsacid era in the collections of Iran National museum and reza Abbasi museum|publisher = Samira| year = 2016| isbn = 9789648955491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Indian development of glass technology in [[South Asia]] may have begun in 1730 BC.&lt;ref name="Gowlett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lukashevichus.info/knigi/mcintosh_ancient_indus_valley.pdf|title=The Ancient Indus Valley|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this culture includes a red-brown glass bead along with a hoard of beads dating to that period, making it the earliest attested glass from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] locations.&lt;ref name=Gowlett/&gt; Glass discovered from later sites dating from 600–300 BC displays common colors.&lt;ref name=Gowlett/&gt;

[[Chalcolithic]] evidence of glass has been found in [[Hastinapur]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=Ghosh&gt;{{cite book|last =  Ghosh|first = Amalananda|title = An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology|publisher = BRILL| year = 1990| isbn = 90-04-09262-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some of the texts which mention glass in India are the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' and ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]''.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt; However, the first unmistakable evidence in large quantities, dating from the 3rd century BC, has been uncovered from the [[archaeological site]] in [[Takshashila]], now in [[Pakistan]], with bangles, beads, small vessels, and tiles discovered in quantity.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt;

By the 1st century AD, glass was being used for ornaments and casing in South Asia.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt; Contact with the [[Greco-Roman world]] added newer techniques, and Indians artisans mastered several techniques of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the succeeding centuries.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt; The [[Satavahana]] period of India also produced short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass.&lt;ref name=Ghosh2&gt;{{cite book|last =  Ghosh|first = Amalananda|title = An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology|publisher = BRILL| year = 1990| isbn = 90-04-09262-5|chapter=Ornaments, Gems etc. (Ch. 10)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Ancient Chinese glass|Peking glass}}
[[File:Nanyue flat blue glass.JPG|thumb|Blue glass plaques found in the [[Mausoleum of the Nanyue King]], dating from late 2nd century BC]]
In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin, C. (2002) "Introduction" pp. XI-XIV in Braghin, C. (ed) ''Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.)''. {{ISBN|8822251628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Soame Jenyns (art historian)|Jenyns, R.]] (1981) ''Chinese Art III: Textiles, Glass and Painting on Glass''. Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC to 221 BC).

Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.&lt;ref name=pinder&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. (1991) "The Islamic lands and China"  p. 140 in Tait, H. (ed) ''Five thousand years of glass''. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Imported glass objects first reached China during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] – early [[Warring States period]] (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome ‘[[eye bead]]s’.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin, C. (2002) "Polychrome and monochrome glass of the Warring States and Han periods" p. 6 in Braghin, C. (ed) ''Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.)''. {{ISBN|8822251628}}&lt;/ref&gt; These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads.

During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.&lt;ref name=pinder/&gt; The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and [[Han Dynasty]] vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of [[barium oxide]] (BaO) and [[lead]], distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, R. and Wood, N. (2004) "Part XII: Ceramic technology" pp. 474–477 in ''Science and Civilisation in China''. Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521838339}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;An Jiayao (2002) "Polycrome and monochrome glass of the Warring States and Han periods" pp. 45–46 in Braghin, C. (ed) ''Chinese Glass.

However, during the 1st century AD, the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colorless or ‘aqua’ glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S. J., 1999.

===Islamic world===
{{main|Islamic glass}}
Islamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the [[Sasanian glass]] of [[Persia]]. The [[Arabic poetry|Arab poet]] al-[[Buhturi]] (820–897) described the clarity of such glass: "Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container."&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan|Hassan, Ahmad Y]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715024128/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm |date=2010-07-15 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]]-[[Arab]] chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' (''The Book of the Hidden Pearl''), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Ahmad Y. [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116020722/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%209.htm |date=2010-11-16 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 11th century, clear glass [[mirror]]s were being produced in [[Al-Andalus|Arab Islamic Spain]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:AndelysVitrail.jpg|thumb|left|A 16th-century stained glass window]]
The Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and [[Anglo-Saxon glass]] and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude [[forest glass]].  The [[claw beaker]] was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass.  Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

Glass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of [[Torcello]] near [[Venice]]. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: [[potash]] obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth605/File5.htm| title = Glass Conservation|accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Donny L. Hamilton|publisher = Conservation Research Laboratory, Texas A&amp;M University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 12th century, [[stained glass]] – glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring – was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for [[Romanesque art]] and especially [[Gothic art]].  Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings.  The 11th century saw the emergence in [[Germany]] of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century [[Venice]]. The [[Crown glass process]] was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the [[glassblower]] would spin approximately 9 [[Avoirdupois|pounds]] (4&amp;nbsp;kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as [[forest glass]].

====Anglo-Saxon world====
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon glass}}
Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"&gt;Bayley, J. (2000). "Glass-working in Early Medieval England" pp. 137–142 in [[Jennifer Price|Price, J.]] ''Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350–1100''. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.&lt;ref name="Evison2000"&gt;Evison, V. I. (2000). "Glass vessels in England, 400–1100 CE" pp. 47–104 in Price, J. ''Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350–1100''. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation of [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and the construction of churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"&gt;Heyworth, M. (1992) "Evidence for early medieval glass-working in north-western Europe" pp. 169–174 in S. Jennings and A. Vince (eds) ''Medieval Europe 1992: Volume 3 Technology and Innovation''. York: Medieval Europe 1992&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical: Of or relating to a church or to an established religion.&lt;/ref&gt; literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyworth1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol22/22_001_024.pdf|author=Harden, D. B. |year=1978|title=Anglo-Saxon and later Medieval glass in Britain: Some recent developments|journal= Medieval Archaeology |volume=22|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewelry, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.&lt;ref&gt;Bimson M. and Freestone, I.C.

====Murano====
{{main|Murano glass|Venetian glass}}
The center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of [[Murano]], which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in [[dinnerware]], [[mirror]]s, and other items. What made Venetian [[Murano glass]] significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with [[soda ash]] obtained from the [[Levant]], for which the Venetians held the sole [[monopoly]]. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called ''obsidianus'' after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.&lt;ref name=Agricola1&gt;[[Georg Agricola]] ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'', Textbook of Mineralogy, M.C. Bandy, J. Bandy, Mineralogical Society of America, 1955, p. 111 [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/agricola-metallica/page_001 Section on Murano Glass, De Natura Fossilium]. Retrieved 2007-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. [[Murano]]’s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

====Bohemia====
{{main|Bohemian glass}}
[[Bohemian glass]], or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative [[glass]] produced in regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now in the current state of the [[Czech Republic]], since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nbig6p_r24C&amp;q=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9vtbD2NfUAhVY-mMKHUweDioQ6AEIJDAA|title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|last=inc|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=9780852295533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Both Nový Bor and Kamenický Šenov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels.

==Modern glass production==

===New processes===
[[Image:Ravenscroft Glass VAndA.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of [[George Ravenscroft|Ravenscroft's]] glass.]]
A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using [[Coal#Ranks|sea-coal]] as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the "working period" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by [[George Ravenscroft]] in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian ''cristallo'', he used [[flint glass|flint as a silica source]], but his glasses tended to [[wikt:crizzle|crizzle]], developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Roy G.|author2=Sandra Davison|title=Conservation of Glass|year=1989|series=Butterworth – Heinemann Series in Conservation and Museology|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]]|location=London|isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of [[Henley-on-Thames]].&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3105182 |jstor=3105182 |pages=776–803 |last1=MacLeod |first1=Christine |title=Accident or Design? George Ravenscroft's Patent and the Invention of Lead-Crystal Glass |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Technology and Culture |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over [[Europe]] with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a [[Glass tax|lucrative tax]] on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as ''Excise glasses''.&lt;ref name=hurst-vose&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst-Vose|first=Ruth|title=Glass|year=1980|series=Collins Archaeology|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|location=London|isbn=0-00-211379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845.

Evidence of the use of the [[blown plate glass]] method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting [[Polished plate glass]] in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown "sheet" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th edition (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at [[Ravenhead]]. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.

===Industrial production===
[[File:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The façade of [[the Crystal Palace]], one of the first buildings to use glass as a main material for construction.]]
The use of glass as a building material was heralded by [[The Crystal Palace]] of 1851, built by [[Joseph Paxton]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]]. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the [[British Crown Glass Company]] (later [[Chance Brothers]]) became the first company to adopt the [[cylinder blown sheet|cylinder method]] to produce sheet glass with the expertise of [[Georges Bontemps]], a famous French glassmaker.{{refn|group=n|This process was used extensively until early in the 20th Century to make window glass.}} This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]], down which it was carried by a system of rollers.&lt;ref&gt;''Bontemps on Glassmaking: the Guide du Verrier of Georges Bontemps'', translated by Michael Cable (2008). Society of Glass Technology. {{ISBN|0900682604}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.

An early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer [[Henry Bessemer]]. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of "Float Glass" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin.

In 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in [[Castleford]], [[Yorkshire]]. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M5TAAAAMAAJ|title=Glass: its tradition and its makers|author=Buch Polak, Ada |year=1975|publisher=Putnam|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Chance_Brothers_and_Co|title=Chance Brothers and Co|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StHelensPilkingtonsTheHotties.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Pilkington]]'s factory, where the [[float glass]] process was developed in the 1950s.]]
In 1898, [[Pilkington]] invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer "Georgian Wired Glass" but it greatly post-dates the [[Georgian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3dqs6zRCcEC|title=Practical Building Conservation: Glass and glazing|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=468|isbn=9780754645573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Machine drawn cylinder sheet glass|Machine Drawn Cylinder technique]] was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by [[Pilkington]] from 1910 onwards.

In 1938, the [[Polished plate glass|polished plate process]] was improved by [[Pilkington]] which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary [[float glass]] process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1969.0212|title=Review Lecture.

Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html "Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT®"]. SCHOTT AG.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight.&lt;ref name=floatpatent&gt;Bickerstaff, Kenneth and Pilkington, Lionel A B {{US Patent |2911759}} "Manufacture of flat glass".

'''ITIL security management''' (originally Information Technology Infrastructure Library) describes the structured fitting of security into an organization. [[ITIL]] security management is based on the ISO 27001 standard. "ISO/IEC 27001:2005 covers all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for profit organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=42103|title=ISO/IEC 27001:2005 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security management systems -- Requirements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization's overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets and give confidence to interested parties."

A basic concept of security management is [[information security]]. The primary goal of information security is to control access to information. The value of the information is what must be protected. These values include [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] and [[availability]]. Inferred aspects are privacy, anonymity and verifiability.

The goal of security management comes in two parts:

* [[Security]] requirements defined in [[service level agreement]]s (SLA) and other external requirements that are specified in underpinning contracts, legislation and possible internal or external imposed policies.
* Basic security that guarantees management continuity. This is necessary to achieve simplified service-level management for information security.

SLAs define security requirements, along with legislation (if applicable) and other contracts. These requirements can act as [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) that can be used for process management and for interpreting the results of the security management process.

The security management process relates to other ITIL-processes. However, in this particular section the most obvious relations are the relations to the [[service level management]], [[incident management]] and [[change management]] processes.

== Security management ==

Security management is a continuous process that can be compared to [[W. Edwards Deming]]'s Quality Circle ([[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]]).

The inputs are requirements from clients. The requirements are translated into security services and security metrics. Both the client and the plan sub-process affect the SLA. The SLA is an input for both the client and the process. The provider develops security plans for the organization. These plans contain policies and operational level agreements. The security plans (Plan) are then implemented (Do) and the implementation is then evaluated (Check). After the evaluation, the plans and the plan implementation are maintained (Act).

The activities, results/products and the process are documented. External reports are written and sent to the clients. The clients are then able to adapt their requirements based on the information received through the reports. Furthermore, the service provider can adjust their plan or the implementation based on their findings in order to satisfy all the requirements stated in the SLA (including new requirements).

===Control===

The first activity in the security management process is the “Control” sub-process. The Control sub-process organizes and manages the security management process. The Control sub-process defines the processes, the allocation of responsibility for the policy statements and the management framework.

The security management framework defines the sub-processes for development, implementation and evaluations into action plans. Furthermore, the management framework defines how results should be reported to clients.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

The meta-process model of the control sub-process is based on a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]] and gives an overview of the activities of the Control sub-process. The grey rectangle represents the control sub-process and the smaller beam shapes inside it represent activities that take place inside it.

|-
| Control documents
| Control is a description of how security management is organized and how it is managed.
|-
| Policy statements
| Policy statements outline specific requirements or rules that must be met. In the [[information security]] realm, policies are usually point-specific, covering a single area. For example, "acceptable use" policies cover the rules and regulations for appropriate use of the computing facilities.
|-
| Security management framework
| Security management framework is an established management framework to initiate and control the implementation of information security within an organization and to manage ongoing information security provision.
|}

The meta-data model of the control sub-process is based on a UML [[class diagram]]. Figure 2.1.2 shows the metamodel of the control sub-process.

Figure 2.1.2: Meta-process model control sub-process

The CONTROL rectangle with a white shadow is an open complex concept. This means that the Control rectangle consists of a collection of (sub) concepts.

Figure 2.1.3 is the process data model of the control sub-process. It shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate the concepts that are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities.

[[Image:Control Process data model.JPG]]

Figure 2.1.3: Process-data model control sub-process

===Plan===

The Plan sub-process contains activities that in cooperation with [[service level management]] lead to the (information) Security section in the SLA. Furthermore, the Plan sub-process contains activities that are related to the underpinning contracts which are specific for (information) security.

In the Plan sub-process the goals formulated in the SLA are specified in the form of operational level agreements (OLA). These OLA’s can be defined as security plans for a specific internal organization entity of the service provider.

Besides the input of the SLA, the Plan sub-process also works with the policy statements of the service provider itself. As said earlier these policy statements are defined in the control sub-process.

The operational level agreements for [[information security]] are set up and implemented based on the ITIL process. This requires cooperation with other ITIL processes. For example, if security management wishes to change the [[IT infrastructure]] in order to enhance security, these changes will be done through the [[change management]] process. Security management delivers the input (Request for change) for this change. The Change Manager is responsible for the change management process.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.2.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Plan sub-process ITIL Security Management
! Activities !! Sub-activities !! Descriptions
|-
| rowspan=4 | Plan

| This process contains activities that lead to the security agreements paragraph in the service level agreements. At the end of this process the ''Security'' section of the service level agreement is created.
|-

| This process contains activities that lead to underpinning contracts. These contracts are specific for security.
|-
| Create operational level agreements
| The general formulated goals in the SLA are specified in operational level agreements. These agreements can be seen as security plans for specific organization units.
|-
| Reporting
| In this process the whole Create plan process is documented in a specific way. This process ends with reports.
|}

Plan consists of a combination of unordered and ordered (sub) activities. The sub-process contains three complex activities that are all closed activities and one standard activity.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.2.2: Concept and definition Plan sub-process security management

|-
| Operational level agreements
| An internal agreement covering the delivery of services which support the IT organization in their delivery of services.
|}

Just as the Control sub-process the Plan sub-process is modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The left side of figure 2.2.1 is the meta-data model of the Plan sub-process.

The Plan rectangle is an open (complex) concept which has an aggregation type of relationship with two closed (complex) concepts and one standard concept. The two closed concepts are not expanded in this particular context.

The following picture (figure 2.2.1) is the [[process-data diagram]] of the Plan sub-process. This picture shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate which concepts are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities of the Plan sub-process.

[[Image:Plan process data model.jpg]]

===Implementation===

The Implementation sub-process makes sure that all measures, as specified in the plans, are properly implemented. During the Implementation sub-process no measures are defined nor changed. The definition or change of measures takes place in the Plan sub-process in cooperation with the Change Management Process.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.3.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Implementation sub-process ITIL Security Management

Process of formally identifying changes by type e.g., project scope change request, validation change request, infrastructure change request this process leads to ''asset classification and control documents''.
|-
| Implement personnel security
| Measures are adopted to give personnel safety and confidence and measures to prevent a crime/fraud. The process ends with ''personnel security''.
|-
| Implement security management
| Specific security requirements and/or security rules that must be met are outlined and documented. The process ends with ''security policies''.
|-
| Implement access control
| Specific access security requirements and/or access security rules that must be met are outlined and documented. The process ends with ''access control''.
|-
| Reporting
| The whole ''implement as planned process'' is documented in a specific way. This process ends with ''reports''.
|}

The left side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-process model of the Implementation phase. The four labels with a black shadow mean that these activities are closed concepts and they are not expanded in this context. No arrows connect these four activities, meaning that these activities are unordered and the reporting will be carried out after the completion of all four activities.

During the implementation phase concepts are created and /or adjusted.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Table 2.3.2: Concept and definition Implementation sub-process Security management
! Concept !! Description
|-
| Implementation
| Accomplished security management according to the security management plan.
|-
| Asset classification and control documents

|-
| Personnel security
| Well defined job descriptions for all staff outlining security roles and responsibilities.
|-
| Security policies
| Documents that outline specific security requirements or security rules that must be met.
|-
| Access control
| Network management to ensure that only those with the appropriate responsibility have access to information in the networks and the protection of the supporting infrastructure.
|}

The concepts created and/or adjusted are modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The right side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-data model of the implementation sub-process.

Implementation documents are an open concept and is expanded upon in this context. It consists of four closed concepts that are not expanded because they are irrelevant in this particular context.

In order to make the relations between the two models clearer the integration of the two models is illustrated in Figure 2.3.1. The dotted arrows running from the activities to the concepts illustrate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities.

===Evaluation===

Evaluation is necessary to measure the success of the implementation and security plans. The evaluation is important for clients (and possibly third parties). The results of the Evaluation sub-process are used to maintain the agreed measures and the implementation. Evaluation results can lead to new requirements and a corresponding [[Request for Change]]. The request for change is then defined and sent to Change Management.

The three sorts of evaluation are self-assessment, internal audit and external audit.

The self-assessment is mainly carried out in the organization of the processes. Internal audits are carried out by internal IT-auditors. External audits are carried out by external, independent IT-auditors. Besides those already mentioned, an evaluation based on communicated security incidents occurs. The most important activities for this evaluation are the security monitoring of IT-systems; verify the security legislation and security plan implementation; trace and react to undesirable use of IT-supplies.

The dotted arrows running from the meta-process diagram (left) to the meta-data diagram (right) indicate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities. All of the activities in the evaluation phase are standard activities. For a short description of the Evaluation phase concepts see Table 2.4.2 where the concepts are listed and defined.

===Maintenance===

Because of organizational and IT-infrastructure changes, security risks change over time, requiring revisions to the security section of service level agreements and security plans.

Maintenance is based on the results of the Evaluation sub-process and insight in the changing risks. These activities will produce proposals. The proposals either serve as inputs for the plan sub-process and travel through the cycle or can be adopted as part of maintaining service level agreements. In both cases the proposals could lead to activities in the action plan. The actual changes are made by the Change Management process.

[[Image:Maintenance process data model.jpg]]

Figure 2.5.1: Process-data model Maintenance sub-process

The maintenance sub-process starts with the maintenance of the service level agreements and the maintenance of the operational level agreements. After these activities take place (in no particular order) and there is a request for a change the request for change activity will take place and after the request for change activity is concluded the reporting activity starts. If there is no request for a change then the reporting activity will start directly after the first two activities. The concepts in the meta-data model are created/ adjusted during the maintenance phase. For a list of the concepts and their definition take a look at table 2.5.2.

== Relations with other ITIL processes ==

The Security Management Process, as stated in the introduction, has relations with almost all other ITIL-processes. These processes are:

* IT Customer Relationship Management &lt;!-- I don't believe that this is actually an ITIL process --&gt;
* [[Service Level Management]]
* Availability Management
* Capacity Management
* IT Service Continuity Management
* Configuration Management
* [[Release Management]]
* Incident Management &amp; Service Desk
* Problem Management
* [[Change Management (ITSM)]]

Within these processes activities concerning security are required. The concerning process and its process manager are responsible for these activities. However, Security Management gives indications to the concerning process on how to structure these activities.

== Example: internal e-mail policies ==

Internal e-mail is subject to multiple security risks, requiring corresponding security plan and policies. In this example the ITIL security Management approach is used to implement e-mail policies.

The Security management team is formed and process guidelines are formulated and communicated to all employees and providers. These actions are carried out in the Control phase.

In the subsequent Planning phase, policies are formulated. Policies specific to e-mail security are formulated and added to service level agreements. At the end of this phase the entire plan is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is done according to the plan.

After implementation the policies are evaluated, either as self-assessments, or via internal or external auditors.

In the maintenance phase the e-policies are adjusted based on the evaluation. Needed changes are processed via Requests for Change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8180">'''Institutional analysis''' is that part of the [[social sciences]] which studies how [[institution]]s—i.e., structures and [[social mechanism|mechanisms]] of social order and cooperation governing the behavior of two or more individuals—behave and function according to both empirical rules (informal rules-in-use and [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]) and also theoretical rules (formal rules and law). This field deals with how individuals and groups construct institutions, how institutions function in practice, and the effects of institutions on each other, on individuals, societies and the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study of Institutions, Population and Environmental Change. (2005). [http://www.cipec.org/research/institutional_analysis Institutional Analysis at CIPEC]. Retrieved 2009-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since institutional analysis is focused on the systematic study of people's collective behaviour, its ability to explain major [[political]], [[social]], or [[historical]] events is sometimes contrasted with the use of [[conspiracy theory]] to explain such events, since the latter focuses on explaining such events by a [[secrecy|secret]], and often [[deception|deceptive]], plot by a [[covert]] [[coalition]] of small numbers of powerful or influential individuals rather than by the systematic, regular, publicly documented behaviour of groups of individuals.&lt;ref name="chomsky_inst_vs_conspiracy"&gt;{{cite web| last =Chomsky| first =Noam| authorlink =Noam Chomsky| coauthors =| title =9-11: Institutional Analysis vs. Conspiracy Theory| work =| publisher =[[Z Communications]]| date =2006-10-06| url =https://zcomm.org/zblogs/9-11-institutional-analysis-vs-conspiracy-theory-by-noam-chomsky/ |format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Albert|Albert, Michael]].

Retrieved 2009-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in various disciplines==
The term ''institutional analysis'' is used by several academic disciplines, and has several meanings and connotations. 

One meaning of institutional analysis refers to actual formal institutions. In the biomedical sciences, “institutional analysis” often refers to analyzing data coming from concrete institutions such as health authorities, hospitals networks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Christian, C. K., et al. (2006). A multi-institutional analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of breast reconstruction: A study of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. ''Annals of Surgery'', 243(2), 241–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the fields of education and public administration and governance studies, the term usually refers to how school boards and governmental agencies implement policies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Trent, Allen, et al. (2003). Problems and Possibilities in the Pursuit of Diversity: An Institutional Analysis. ''Equity &amp; Excellence in Education'', 36(3), 213–224; also Henriksen, Helle Zinner H. H. and Jan J. D. Damsgaard. (2007). Dawn of e-government: An institutional analysis of seven initiatives and their impact. ''Journal of Information Technology'', 22(1), 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another meaning refers to institutions as ''ways of thinking'' that have a direct impact on behaviors. Under this approach, there are several variations and usages of institutional analysis. In economics, it is used to explain why economic behaviors do not conform to the theory of supply and demand. This is a relatively old school of thought that has its roots in the work of early 20th-century economists like [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]].&lt;ref&gt;Pareto, Vilfredo. (1935) [1916]. ''The Mind and Society''. New York: Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent contemporary figures of institutional analysis in economics is [[Douglass North]],&lt;ref&gt;See, among others: Davis, Lance and Douglass North. (1971) ''Institutional Change and American Economic Growth''. London: Cambridge University Press; and North, Douglass and Robert Thomas. (1973). ''The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic History''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who received the [[Nobel Prize for Economics]] in 1993. 

Sociology has also used institutional analysis since its inception to study how social institutions such as the laws or the family evolve over time. The foundational author of this approach is [[Émile Durkheim]], also founder of sociology as a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. (1995) [1915] ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''. New York: Free Press; and (1983) [1922] ''The Division of Labour in Society''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, however, there are cross-pollinations between the sociological and economic traditions in institutional analysis. A new focus is to explain how organizations and individuals within organizations make economic and managerial decisions, particularly by investigating the non-rational, non-economic, and non-psychological factors. This movement produced what is known as the '''New Institutional Analysis'''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aranson, Peter H. (1998) The New Institutional Analysis of Politics ''Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft'', Vol. 154, No. 4 (Dec. 1998), pp. 744-753&lt;/ref&gt; The neoinstitutional approach has several variants. One of them tries to improve economic models based on the theory of [[Public choice theory|public choice]], and one of its applications is known as the ''institutional analysis and development'' (IAD) framework developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]] 2009 [[Nobel Prize for Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant is influenced by organizational sociology and seeks to integrate [[Max Weber]]’s work on bureaucratic mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. (1978). ''Economy and society''. Berkeley: University of California Press; and (1976) [1904]. ''The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism''. London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Di Maggio, Paul J. and [[Walter W. Powell]] (Eds.). (1991). ''The new institutionalism of organizational analysis''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There is also a '''French school'''&lt;ref&gt;See among others, Lapassade, Georges. (2006) ''Groupes, organisations, institutions''. Paris: Anthropos; and Authier, Michel and Rémi Hess. (1994). ''L’analyse institutionnelle''. Paris: Presses universitaires de France.&lt;/ref&gt; of institutional analysis influenced by the Durkheimian analysis of social institutions, and the anthropological school of thought established by [[Marcel Mauss]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Mauss was the nephew and close collaborator of Durkheim. Mauss is one of the founders of cultural anthropology, and is well known for his work on the institutional dimension of gift-giving in pre-modern societies. See Mauss, Marcel. (1969). ''The gift: forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies''. London: Cohen &amp; West.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to institutional analysis is also influenced by thinkers such as [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]&lt;ref&gt;Castoriadis, Cornelius. (1975). ''L’institution imaginaire de la société''. Paris: du Seuil.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. (1972). ''Histoire de la folie''. Paris: Gallimard, and (1975). ''Surveiller et punir: naissance de la prison''. Paris: Gallimard.&lt;/ref&gt; The main thrust of this approach is the identification of hidden forms of power that institute behaviors and organizational procedures.

The '''International Forestry Resources and Institutions''' (IFRI) Network is a collective of research partners at 12 universities or [[non-governmental organization]]s in 11 countries around the world that focus on how institutions and governance arrangements shape forest use and [[forest management|management]] outcomes. Scholars and policy makers affiliated with IFRI are interested in understanding the role of formal and informal institutions in enhancing livelihoods and adaptive capacity of peoples, conserving biodiversity, and promoting greater sustainability in [[carbon sequestration]]. IFRI's goal is to carry out rigorous research that can help policy makers and forest users design and implement improved evidence-based forest policies. IFRI comprises partner collaborating research institutes in [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. IFRI utilizes the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, created at the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at [[Indiana University]] by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues.

The IFRI research program was initiated in 1992 at Indiana University. It moved in 2006 to [[University of Michigan]] where it is currently housed at the School of Natural Resources and Environment and coordinated by Arun Agrawal.

==Collaborating Resource Centers==
In addition to Indiana University and the University of Michigan, the following institutions are partners in the program:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Partners | work = International Forestry Resources and Institutes | publisher = University of Michigan | date =  | url = http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/ifri/partners | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Guatemala &amp;ndash; [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]] (2002)
* Colombia &amp;ndash; [[Pontifical Xavierian University]] and the [[Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute]]

==Goals==
Some of the goals of the IFRI network are to:
* determine how to change processes leading to [[deforestation]] in many countries of the world;
* assess the nature of tradeoffs among forest conservation, livelihoods promotion, and carbon sequestration
* analyze the role of institutions and policies in promoting better forest outcomes

IFRI provides a way for people to collect, store, and analyze data over time about forests and the communities that use forests. It can be used to:
* conduct baseline studies;
* measure change over time in forest conditions and in local governance structures; and
* share information with pertinent and interested colleagues.

The IFRI is unique from other research programs and databases in that:
* it is composed of a network of Collaborating Research Centers (CRCs) that utilize a common research methodology and database that includes a diverse array of variables taken from the environmental and social sciences; 
* the design of the IFRI research instruments is based on the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and previous theoretical and empirical studies.  The IAD framework, developed by colleagues at the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, provides a unique way for researchers to transcend disciplinary boundaries;
* IFRI focuses and collects data on institutional, social, and ecological variables which can be stored in a single IFRI database, and analyzed to understand the inter-relationships among social and ecological processes and outcomes.

A '''khanate''' or '''khaganate''' is a political entity ruled by a [[Khan (title)|khan]] or [[Khagan|khagan]]. This political entity is typical for people from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and it can be equivalent to [[tribe|tribal]] [[chiefdom]], [[principality]], [[monarchy|kingdom]] or [[empire]].

== Mongol khanates (or khaganates) ==

After [[Genghis Khan]] established [[appanage]]s for his family in the [[Mongol Empire]] during his rule (1206-1227),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peter Jackson|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3NZpbDOSAcQC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=from+ulus+to+khanate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8HAxw1kX_y&amp;sig=CWzj7GsVQI_0B0qEd0I74NgUP6c&amp;hl=mn&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QxW1UsGyI5DDoATsyoCoCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=from%20ulus%20to%20khanate&amp;f=false 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt; his sons, daughters,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford, ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire'', Crown Publishing Group, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and grandsons inherited separate sections of the empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">The '''Miami Science Barge''' (also known as the '''Science Barge''') is a floating [[marine laboratory]] and education platform docked in [[Museum Park (Miami)|Museum Park]], [[Miami]], FL since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sentenac|first1=Hannah|title=Miami Science Barge to Debut in Museum Park Tomorrow for Earth Day|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/miami-science-barge-to-debut-in-museum-park-tomorrow-for-earth-day-8400738|accessdate=8 May 2017|date= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barge, designed to help support a more sustainable city, has three main areas of focus: marine ecology and conservation, sustainability, and alternative agriculture. It is completely off-grid and off-pipe and provides approximately enough energy and food production to support an average American family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arrowsmith|first1=Sue|title=Miami Science Barge offers city children chance to explore nature|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article95794857.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, over 3000 students came aboard to learn about the innovative technology on the Barge. The vessel is open to the public on Saturday. 
The Miami Science Barge was conceived by Nathalie Manzano and designed by Manzano and [[Theodore Caplow|Ted Caplow]]. They were inspired by the [[Science Barge]] built in 2006 by New York Sun Works, designed by Caplow. The vessels are of similar size and both have a sustainable technology focus, but they respond to very different local environmentsand house differing technology and unique public education programs. The Miami Science Barge emphasizes aquaculture.
The Miami Science Barge was donated in April 2017 to the brand-new Philip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, which currently owns and operates it.

== Early history == 
In 2015, [[Nathalie Manzano]] and [[Ted Caplow]] of [[CappSci]] won the [[Knight Cities Challenge]] grant competition from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] with a proposal to build the Miami Science Barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Nancy|title=Miami Science Barge wins Knight award|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article16959965.html|accessdate=May 8, 2017|agency=Miami Herald|publisher=McClatchy|date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Barge was a 120x30 steel construction barge from [[Grady Marine]] retrofitted with 2nd-hand [[shipping container]]s in 2015. With the generosity of Beau Payne of P &amp; L Towing, the staff of CappSci were able to design and build the power system and exhibits of the Barge on the Miami River prior to moving it to its official location in Museum Park in downtown Miami, FL.
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016. The following April, the Barge was gifted to [[Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science]].

== Technical details ==
The Miami Science Barge has three main areas of focus:

===Sustainability ===
The Barge is fully [[off-grid]]. It utilizes 48 [[solar panel]]s (donated by JinkoSolar) to generate enough power to run all of its systems. These panels are set into five arrays including a [[solar dance floor]] and a [[solar tracking system]]. Power is stored into two sets of batteries: [[lead-acid batteries]], and experimental Aquion [[M-Line battery modules]]. The panels provide about 75Kwh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PennEnergy Editors|title=JinkoSolar Powers the Miami Science Barge|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/08/solar-power-news-jinkosolar-powers-the-miami-science-barge.html|website=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also [[off-pipe]], meaning that all of its fresh water comes from a rainwater catchment system located about the classroom area. The water is stored in a 900-gallon cistern. The salt water comes directly from [[Biscayne Bay]]. No discharge is released from the Barge. Waste water is collected in constructed wetland troughs where the water is filtered or in some cases may evaporate. 
Furthermore, the Barge aimed to utilize only sustainable material in construction, i.e. the [[Kebony]] deck throughout the farm area. Kebony is an eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwoods, using a bio-based seal instead of a synthetic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge Opens|url=http://kebony.com/us/blog/miami-science-barge-opens/|website=Kebony.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The staff on the Barge also follow strict habits of sustainability, including prohibiting [[single-use plastic]]s from being used on board for events and by diligently cleaning debris found in the notch.

===Alternative agriculture===
On board are a variety of sustainable and unconventional agriculture systems including [[hydroponics]], [[aeroponics]], aquaculture, and aquaponics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Science Barge|url=https://ezgrogarden.com/commercial-sytems/miami-science-barge/|website=EZ Grow Gardens|publisher=Commercial Systems, News|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hydroponics and aeroponics are forms of growing produce that utilizes water and nutrients most efficiently. Aquaculture systems grow fish and other marine creature for consumption so as not to harm the balance in the ocean and aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and aquaponics, where marine life produce waste which is consumed by plants.
On board is also a [[vertically integrated greenhouse]] (patented by Caplow and Zak W. Adams).

===Marine ecology and conservation===
Along with the [[aquaponic]] and [[aquaculture]] tanks, there are multiple tanks showcasing marine life. Towards the entrance of the Barge, there is a [[coral]] tank, developed with the help of Dr. [[Diego Lirman]] at the [[University of Miami]] and Rescue a Reef. It is the only tank in South Florida representing what [[Coral reef protection#Restoration|coral restoration]] in the wild looks like. Other exhibit tanks show sea life from Biscayne Bay, including [[sea horse]]s, a [[Petrochirus diogenes|giant hermit crab]], erosion-preventing [[sea grass]]es, [[mangrove]]s, and a myriad of local fish.

These tanks are used to educate about the importance of diversity in Miami’s local ecology. Guest scientists are invited most weekends and on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for Sip of Science to promote the conservation of the environment.

== Response ==
The Miami Science Barge opened on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2016 and was attended by dignitary speakers including City of Miami Commissioner [[Frank Carollo]], who in his remarks called the Barge "a symbol of Miami's diversity not only in people, but in ideas, as well as, a symbol of our community's commitment to environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Commissioner &amp; Bayfront Park  Management Trust Chairman Frank Carollo invites the public to the official launching of the Miami Science Barge, on Earth Day April 22nd|url=http://www.miamigov.com/comm/docs/Press_Releases/2016/04-19%20Miami%20Science%20Barge.htm|website=Miamigov.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Miami Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Knight Foundation’s Miami Program Director Matt Haggman, and Children Trust’s Founding Board Chair David Lawrence, Jr. 
In December 2016, Miami Science Barge was named one of “The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami” by Miami New Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shim Roth|first1=Minhae|title=The Ten Best Things to Do in Downtown Miami|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/the-ten-best-things-to-do-in-downtown-miami-8981277|accessdate=8 May 2017|agency=Miami New Times|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44251">'''Microbial metabolism''' is the means by which a [[microbe]] obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. [[carbon]]) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of [[metabolism|metabolic]] strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's [[ecological niche]], and often allow for that microbe to be useful in [[biotechnology|industrial processes]] or responsible for [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles.

==Types==
[[File:Troph flowchart.svg|thumb|350px|right|Flow chart to determine the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms]]
{{main|Primary nutritional groups}} 

All microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:

1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:
* '''[[autotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}})
* '''[[heterotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[organic compound]]s
* '''[[mixotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide
2. How the organism obtains [[reducing equivalent]]s used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:
* '''[[lithotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from [[inorganic compound]]s
* '''[[organotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from organic compounds
3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:
* '''[[chemotroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from external [[chemical compound]]s
* '''[[phototroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from light

In practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:

* '''chemolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples: [[Nitrifying bacteria]], Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria]], [[Knallgas-bacteria]]
* '''photolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from light and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic compounds. Examples: [[Cyanobacteria]] (water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) as reducing equivalent donor), [[Chlorobiaceae]], [[Chromatiaceae]] (hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|link=Hydrogen sulfide|H|2|S}}) as reducing equivalent donor), ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as reducing equivalent donor)
* '''chemolithoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}). Examples: some ''[[Hydrogenophilaceae|Thiobacilus]]'', some ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', some ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Wolinella]]'' (with {{chem|H|2}} as reducing equivalent donor), some [[Knallgas-bacteria]], some [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]
* '''chemoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most bacteria, e. g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp., ''[[Actinobacteria]]''
* '''photoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: ''[[Rhodobacter]]'', ''[[Rhodopseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rhodospirillum]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', ''[[Rhodocyclus]]'', ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)

==Heterotrophic microbial metabolism==

Some microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as [[commensals]] or [[parasite]]s) or find in dead organic matter of all kind ([[saprophage]]s). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms are heterotrophic by [[predation]] or [[parasitism]], properties also found in some bacteria such as ''[[Bdellovibrio]]'' (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as ''[[Myxococcus]]'' (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most [[pathogen]]ic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic [[polymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[chitin]] or [[lignin]] which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide ([[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in [[bioremediation]].

Biochemically, [[prokaryotic]] heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using [[glycolysis]] (also called [[Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas|EMP pathway]]) for sugar metabolism and the [[citric acid cycle]] to degrade [[acetate]], producing energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and reducing power in the form of [[NADH]] or [[quinols]].  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the [[KDPG pathway|keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway]] (also called [[Entner–Doudoroff pathway|ED pathway]]) in ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the [[mitochondrion]], the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[bacterium]] related to obligate intracellular ''[[Rickettsia]]'', and also to plant-associated ''[[Rhizobium]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium]]''.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these [[Proteobacteria]].  Most microbes [[Cellular respiration|respire]] (use an [[electron transport chain]]), although [[oxygen]] is not the only [[terminal electron acceptor]] that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.

==Fermentation==
{{main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}

Fermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses [[organic compound|organic carbon]] instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to {{chem|NAD|+}} and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of {{chem|NAD|+}} for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and [[aerobic respiration]] when oxygen is present.  These organisms are [[facultative anaerobe]]s.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately]] fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an [[ATP synthase]] as in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] where a [[phosphate]] group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of [[Coenzyme A]]-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including [[hydrogen]] gas ({{chem|H|2}}). These reduced organic compounds are generally small [[organic acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s derived from [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], the end product of [[glycolysis]]. Examples include [[ethanol]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[butyric acid|butyrate]]. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.

Not all fermentative organisms use substrate-level [[phosphorylation]]. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a [[proton motive force|proton (or sodium) motive force]] and therefore [[ATP synthesis]].  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include [[succinate]] fermentation by ''[[Propionigenium modestum]]'' and [[oxalate]] fermentation by ''[[Oxalobacter formigenes]]''. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce [[Lactic acid|lactate]] from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.

==Special metabolic properties==

===Methylotrophy===

Methylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use [[C1-compounds]] as energy sources. These compounds include [[methanol]], [[methyl amine]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and [[formic acid|formate]].  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria ''[[Methylomonas]]'' and ''[[Methylobacter]]''.  [[Methanotroph]]s are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}), formaldehyde ({{chem|CH|2|O}}), formate ({{chem|HCOO|-}}), and carbon dioxide {{CO2}} initially using the enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]].  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are [[obligate aerobe]]s.  Reducing power in the form of [[quinone]]s and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to {{CO2}} (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the [[serine pathway]] (''[[Methylosinus]]'', ''[[Methylocystis]]'') or the [[ribulose monophosphate pathway]] (''[[Methylococcus]]''), depending on the species of methylotroph.

In addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of [[methanogen]]ic [[Archaea]] working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.

[[Methanogenesis]] is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] Archaea such as ''[[Methanococcus]]'', ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'', ''[[Methanobacterium]]'',
''[[Methanothermus]]'', ''[[Methanosarcina]]'', ''[[Methanosaeta]]'' and ''[[Methanopyrus]]''.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as [[coenzyme M]] and [[methanofuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=DiMarco AA, Bobik TA, Wolfe RS |title=Unusual coenzymes of methanogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=59 |pages=355&amp;ndash;94 |year=1990 |pmid=2115763 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.59.070190.002035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a [[proton]] gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) to methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}})  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]].  A second group of methanogens use methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using {{CO2}} as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|COO|-}}) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the [[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] to fix {{CO2}} and obtain cellular carbon.

===Syntrophy===

Syntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a [[chemical reaction]] that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, [[ethanol]] and [[butyrate]]) by organisms such as ''[[Syntrophomonas]]''.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a [[hydrogenotrophic]] (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm) and thereby shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is "pulled" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and {{CO2}}.

==Anaerobic respiration==

While [[aerobic organism]]s during respiration use oxygen as a [[terminal electron acceptor]], [[anaerobic organism]]s use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many [[facultative anaerobe]]s can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.

Most respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of [[anaerobic respiration]] are also known.

===Denitrification – nitrate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Denitrification}}

Denitrification is the utilization of [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) and some organic [[electron acceptor]]s.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and dinitrogen ({{chem|N|2}}) by the enzymes [[nitrate reductase]], [[nitrite reductase]], nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri]]'') reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important [[greenhouse gas]]es that react with [[sunlight]] and [[ozone]] to produce nitric acid, a component of [[acid rain]].  Denitrification is also important in biological [[wastewater]] treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing [[eutrophication]].

===Sulfate reduction – sulfate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Sulfate-reducing bacteria}}

[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction]] is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the [[deltaproteobacteria]], Gram-positive organisms relating to ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' or the archaeon ''[[Archaeoglobus]]''. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.

====Electron donors====

Many sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as [[electron donor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishimoto M, Koyama J, Nagai Y |title=Biochemical Studies on Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: IV. The Cytochrome System of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria|journal=J Biochem |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=763–70 |date=September 1954 |url=http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/41/6/763}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno O, Li YY, Noike T |title= The behavior of sulfate-reducing bacteria in acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion |journal=Water Research |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1626–34 |date=May 1998 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00372-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some unusual autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Desulfobacteraceae|Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans]]'') can use [[phosphite]] ({{chem|HPO|3|-}}) as an electron donor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schink B, Thiemann V, Laue H, Friedrich MW |title= ''Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans'' sp. nov., a new marine sulfate reducer that oxidizes phosphite to phosphate |journal=Arch Microbiol |volume=177 |issue=5 |pages= 381–91|date=May 2002 |pmid=11976747 |doi= 10.1007/s00203-002-0402-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others (e.g. ''[[Desulfovibrio|Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens]]'') are capable of sulfur disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to produce both hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) and sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson BE, McInerney MJ |title=Thiosulfate Disproportionation by Desulfotomaculum thermobenzoicum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=3650–3|date=August 2000 |pmid=10919837 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.66.8.3650-3653.2000 |pmc= 92201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy for reduction====

All sulfate-reducing organisms are strict anaerobes.  Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form [[sulfite]] ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.

===Acetogenesis – carbon dioxide as electron acceptor===
{{main|Acetogenesis}}

Acetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide [[Redox|reduction]] in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.

===Other inorganic electron acceptors===

Ferric iron ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in [[electron transport]], ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'' and ''[[Geobacter|Geobacter metallireducens]]''.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''G. metallireducens'') can use toxic [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated [[aquifer]]s.

Although ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other [[inorganic]] ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when [[heavy metals]] or [[radionuclide]]s are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:
* [[Manganese|Manganic ion]] ({{chem|Mn|4+}}) reduction to [[manganous ion]] ({{chem|Mn|2+}})
* [[Selenium|Selenate]] ({{chem|SeO|4|2-}}) reduction to [[Selenium|selenite]] ({{chem|SeO|3|2-}}) and selenite reduction to inorganic [[selenium]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Arsenic|Arsenate]] ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) reduction to [[arsenic|arsenite]] ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}})
* [[Uranyl|Uranyl ion]] ion ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}) reduction to [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}})

===Organic terminal electron acceptors===

A number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:
* [[Fumarate]] reduction to [[succinate]]
* [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|Trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO) reduction to [[trimethylamine]] (TMA)
* [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) reduction to [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS)
* Reductive dechlorination
TMAO is a chemical commonly produced by [[fish]], and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.

==Chemolithotrophy==

[[Chemolithotrophy]] is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).

===Hydrogen oxidation===
{{main|Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria}}
Many organisms are capable of using hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen [[oxidation]] have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100040856| title=knallgas reaction| publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy

In these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound [[hydrogenase]] causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and [[cytochrome]]s.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the [[Calvin cycle]].  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as ''Cupriavidus necator'' (formerly ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]''), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.

===Sulfur oxidation===

Sulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide {{chem|H|2|S}}), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to form [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', a microbe originally described by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. Another example is ''[[Paracoccus]]''. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using [[reverse electron flow]], an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their [[thermodynamic]] gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and subsequently converted to sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}) by the enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]].&lt;ref name="sulfite"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kappler U, Bennett B, Rethmeier J, Schwarz G, Deutzmann R, McEwan AG, Dahl C |title= Sulfite:Cytochrome ''c'' Oxidoreductase from ''Thiobacillus novellus''.  Purification, Characterization, and Molecular Biology of a Heterodimeric Member of the Sulfite Oxidase Family |journal= J Biol Chem |volume=275 |issue=18 |pages=13202–12|date=May 2000 |pmid=10788424 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.275.18.13202 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/275/18/13202.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see [[Microbial metabolism#Energy for reduction|above]]).  In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.&lt;ref name="sulfite" /&gt;  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. ''[[Thiobacillus denitrificans]]'') use nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.

===Ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) oxidation===
{{further information|Acidophiles in acid mine drainage}}

[[Iron(II) oxide|Ferrous iron]] is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low [[pH]]s or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|3}}).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]]s, such as the bacteria ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]'', as well as the [[archaeon]] ''[[Ferroplasma]]''.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in [[acid mine drainage]].  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example ''[[Gallionella ferruginea]]'', ''[[Leptothrix ochracea]]'', or ''[[Mariprofundus ferrooxydans]]'') live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are  microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Rhodopseudomonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiao Y, Kappler A, Croal LR, Newman DK |title= Isolation and Characterization of a Genetically Tractable Photoautotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain TIE-1 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=4487–96|date=August 2005 |pmid=16085840 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.71.8.4487-4496.2005 |pmc= 1183355}}&lt;/ref&gt; which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme [[rusticyanin]] to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.

===Nitrification===

Nitrification is the process by which [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3}}) is converted to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite ({{chem|link=Nitrite|NO|2|-}}) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrobacter]]'').  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to [[hydroxylamine]] ({{chem|NH|2|OH}}) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the [[cytoplasm]], followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the [[periplasm]].

Electron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.

In 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'' is capable of complete nitrification ([[Comammox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complete nitrification by a single microorganism|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/full/nature16459.html#ref4|journal = Nature|date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 555–559|volume = 528|issue = 7583|doi = 10.1038/nature16459|first = Maartje A.

===Anammox===

Anammox stands for anaerobic ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible were relatively recently discovered, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strous M |title=Missing lithotroph identified as new planctomycete |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6743 |pages=446–9 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10440372 |doi=10.1038/22749 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Fuerst JA |author3=Kramer EH |display-authors=3 |last4=Kramer |first4=Evelien H. M. |last5=Logemann |first5=Susanne |last6=Muyzer |first6=Gerard |last7=Van De Pas-Schoonen |first7=Katinka T. |last8=Webb |first8=Richard |last9=Kuenen |first9=J. Gijs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of metabolism occurs in members of the [[Planctomycetes]] (e.g. Candidatus ''[[Brocadia anammoxidans]]'') and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite reduction.  As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are strict anaerobes.  Amazingly, [[hydrazine]] ({{chem|N|2|H|4}} – rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism.  To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) [[ladderane]] lipid membrane.  These lipids are unique in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate.  Anammox organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is unclear.  Because of this property, these organisms could be used to remove nitrogen in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu G, Peng Y, Li B, Guo J, Yang Q, Wang S |title=Biological removal of nitrogen from wastewater |journal=Rev Environ Contam Toxicol |volume=192 |issue= |pages=159–95 |year=2008 |pmid=18020306 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71724-1_5 |series=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |isbn=978-0-387-71723-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anammox has also been shown to have widespread occurrence in anaerobic aquatic systems and has been speculated to account for approximately 50% of nitrogen gas production in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Op den Camp HJ |title=Global impact and application of the anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=34 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=174–8 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16417514 |doi=10.1042/BST0340174 |name-list-format=vanc }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phototrophy==
{{Main|Phototrophic prokaryotes}}

Many microbes (phototrophs) are capable of using light as a source of energy to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[organic compound]]s such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s.  Of these, [[algae]] are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using water as an [[electron donor]] for electron transfer during photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gräber| first1=Peter| last2=Milazzo|first2=Giulio| title= Bioenergetics| year= 1997| publisher=Birkhäuser| page= 80| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N-EUfoA4tCIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=oxygenic+photosynthesis+algae+water+%22electron+donor%22&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=oxygenic%20photosynthesis%20algae%20water%20%22electron%20donor%22| isbn= 978-3-7643-5295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla [[Cyanobacteria]], [[Chlorobi]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]], and [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on [[Earth]]. Because [[chloroplast]]s were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these [[endosymbiont]]s can also be applied to chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadden G |title=Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=513–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10607659 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) as an electron donor to produce sulfate.  Inorganic sulfur ({{chem|S|0}}), thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) and ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) can also be used by some organisms.  Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), [[Green sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chlorobium]]), [[Green non-sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chloroflexus]]), or the [[heliobacteria]] (Low %G+C Gram positives).  In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon ''[[Halobacterium]]'' or the bacterium ''[[Roseobacter]]'', among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488&amp;ndash;96 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.  All photosynthetic organisms locate their [[photosynthetic reaction center]]s  within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] (Proteobacteria), [[thylakoid membrane]]s (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called [[chlorosome]]s (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoids]], allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and thereby inhabit different [[ecological niche|niche]]s.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. [[phycobilisome]]s in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.

Biochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the [[Z scheme]] of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein [[ferredoxin]], an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.

Most photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).

==Nitrogen fixation==
{{main|Nitrogen fixation}}

Nitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the [[atmosphere]], dinitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high [[activation energy]].  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cabello P, Roldán MD, Moreno-Vivián C |title=Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3527&amp;ndash;46 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528644 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.27303-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/11/3527?view=long&amp;pmid=15528644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between [[legume]]s and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.

Nitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:
* heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. ''[[Anabaena]]'') where one cell does not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in turn provide it with energy
* root nodule symbioses (e.g. ''[[Rhizobium]]'') with plants that supply oxygen to the bacteria bound to molecules of [[leghaemoglobin]]
* anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'')
* very fast metabolism (e.g. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'')
The production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16–24 ATP are used per {{chem|N|2}} fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1022">In [[computability theory]], the '''mortality''' problem is a [[decision problem]] which can be stated as follows:

:''Given a [[Turing machine]], decide whether it halts when run on any configuration (not necessarily a starting one)''

In the statement above, the configuration is a pair &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;q, w&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where q is one of the machine's states (not necessarily its initial state) and w is an infinite sequence of symbols representing the initial content of the tape. Note that while we usually assume that in the starting configuration all but finitely many cells on the tape are blanks, in the mortality problem the tape can have arbitrary content, including infinitely many non-blank symbols written on it.

Philip K. Hooper proved in 1966 that the mortality problem is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. However, it can be shown that the set of Turing machines which are mortal (i.e. halt on every starting configuration) is [[recursively enumerable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''''opus gallicum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Gallic work") was a technique of construction whereby precise holes were created in stone masonry for the insertion of wooden beams to create a wooden infrastructure. The technique was so named because, though its presence is attested in protohistoric times, its use was common enough in [[Gaul]] to merit mention in [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[De Bello Gallico|De bello Gallico]]'' and was frequently employed in the [[Merovingian]] era. The technique was imported by the [[Normans]] into the [[Molise]], where it was used extensively in the raising of [[castle]]s in a short time. Gaulish masons are even known to have brought the technique from Merovingian Francia to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and employed it in [[church architecture]]. 

The ''opus gallicum'' served not only as an infrastructural base, but also a [[Superstructure|superstructural]] binding element designed to strengthen the masonry. While the arrangement of some of the holes found in preserved structures is often perplexing, leaving doubt as to the exact function of the beams, modern scholarship has largely moved away from the theory that the ''opus gallicum'' was a rare and inefficient method. Overall the technique was not uncommon in the Middle Ages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">Broadly defined, '''positive neuroscience''' is the study of what the [[Human brain|brain]] does well.  Instead of studying [[mental illness]], positive neuroscientists focus on valued cognitive qualities that serve to enrich personal life and/or society.  Topics in positive neuroscience overlap heavily with those of [[Positive Psychology]], but use [[neuroimaging]] techniques to extend beyond the behavioral level and explain the [[neurobiology]] which underpins "positive" cognitive phenomena such as [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[optimism]], and healthy [[aging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveneuroscience.com/ positiveneuroscience]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Though '''positive neuroscience''' is only beginning to be recognized as an emerging field, empirical research of optimal or exceptional brain functioning has been conducted at least as far back as the 1970s.  Early work was confined to the use of lesion studies, and thus was only very case-specific.  Human [[Electroencephalography]], first practiced in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Swartz, B.E | year = 1998 | last2 = Goldensohn | month =   | first2 = ES| title = '''Timeline of the history of EEG and associated fields''' | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 106 | issue =  2| pages = 173–6 | doi=10.1016/S0013-4694(97)00121-1 | pmid=9741779}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a methodology for the study of creativity in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martindale C, Armstrong J |title=The relationship of creativity to cortical activation and its operant control |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=124 |issue=2d Half |pages=311–20 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4842281 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1974.10532293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in vivo brain imaging has become more sophisticated, investigations of positive neuroscience phenomena have incorporated functional imaging ([[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[Positron Emission Tomography]]) and structural imaging ([[Diffusion MRI]], [[voxel-based morphometry]], [[in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]).  Examples of research centers currently active in the field of '''positive neuroscience''' include [[Martin Seligman|Martin Seligman's]] lab at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Rex Jung's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725181422/http://www.mrn.org/principal-investigators/rex-jung-ph.d.html |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; lab at [[The Mind Research Network]].

==The Templeton Foundation==
In 2009, the John Templeton Foundation and a committee of advisors at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] put out a call for grant proposals aimed at investigators "conducting research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the ways in which the brain enables flourishing."  Qualifying projects had to "apply tools of neuroscience to positive psychological concepts", and focus on one of the following areas:

* [[Virtue]], strength, and positive [[emotion]]: What are the neural bases of the cognitive and affective capacities that enable virtues such as [[discipline]], persistence, [[honesty]], [[compassion]], [[love]], [[curiosity]], social and practical [[intelligence]], [[courage]], [[creativity]], and [[optimism]]?
* Exceptional abilities: What is special about the [[Human brain|brains]] of exceptional individuals and what can we learn from them?
* [[Meaning (existential)|Meaning]] and positive purpose: How does the brain enable individuals and groups to find meaning and achieve larger goals?
* Decisions, [[values]], and [[free will]]: How does the [[Human brain|brain]] enable decisions based on values and how can decision-making be improved? What can [[neuroscience]] reveal about the nature of human freedom?
* Religious [[belief]], [[prayer]], and [[meditation]]: How do religious and [[spirituality|spiritual]] practices affect neural function and behavior?

Fifteen research projects are now underway as part of the [http://www.posneuroscience.org/ Positive Neuroscience Project].

'''Readability''' is the ease with which a [[reading (process)|reader]] can [[understanding|understand]] a [[writing|written text]]. In [[natural language]], the readability of text depends on its [[content (media)|content]] (the complexity of its vocabulary and [[syntax]]) and its presentation (such as [[typography|typographic]] aspects like [[font size]], [[line height]], and [[line length]]). Researchers have used various factors to measure readability, such as
* Speed of perception
* Perceptibility at a distance
* Perceptibility in peripheral vision
* Visibility
* Reflex blink technique
* Rate of work (reading speed)
* [[Eye movement in language reading|Eye movements]]
* Fatigue in reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Legibility of Print|last=Tinker|first=Miles A.|year= 1963|publisher= Iowa State University Press|location= Iowa|isbn= 0-8138-2450-8|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readability is more than simply [[legibility]]—which is a measure of how easily a reader can distinguish individual letters or characters from each other.

Higher readability eases reading effort and speed for any reader, but it is especially important for those who do not have high [[reading comprehension]]. In readers with average or poor reading comprehension, raising the readability level of a text from mediocre to good can make the difference between success and failure of its [[communication]] goals.

Readability exists in both [[natural language]] and [[programming language]]s though in different forms. In [[computer programming|programming]], things such as programmer [[comment (computer programming)|comments]], choice of [[control flow#Loops|loop]] structure, and [[naming convention (programming)|choice of names]] can determine [[computer programming#Readability of source code|the ease with which humans can read computer program code]].

==Definition==
&lt;!-- Let us list how these works define readability! --&gt;
People have defined readability in various ways, e.g., in: The Literacy Dictionary,&lt;ref name="Harris1995"&gt;Harris, Theodore L. and Richard E. Hodges, eds. 1995. ''The Literacy Dictionary, The Vocabulary of Reading and Writing.'' Newark, DE: International Reading Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeanne Chall and Edgar Dale,&lt;ref name="DaleChall"&gt;Dale, Edgar and Jeanne S. Chall. 1949. "The concept of readability."  ''Elementary English'' 26:23.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Harry McLaughlin,&lt;ref name="McLaughlin1969"&gt;McLaughlin, G. H. 1969. "SMOG grading-a new readability formula." ''Journal of reading'' 22:639–646.&lt;/ref&gt; William DuBay.&lt;ref name="DuBay"&gt;DuBay, W. H. 2006. ''Smart language: Readers, Readability, and the Grading of Text''. Costa Mesa:Impact Information.&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy reading helps learning and enjoyment, so what we write should be easy to understand.&lt;ref name="fry"&gt;Fry, Edward B. 2006. "Readability." ''Reading Hall of Fame Book.'' Newark, DE: International Reading Assn.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many writers and speakers since ancient times have used plain language{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, the 20th century brought more focus to reading ease. Much research has focused on matching prose to reading skills. This has used many successful formulas: in research, government, teaching,  publishing, the military, medicine, and business. Many people in many languages have been helped by this.&lt;ref name="Fryuse"&gt;Fry, E. B. 1986. ''Varied uses of readability measurement.'' Paper presented at the 31st Annual Meeting of the International Reading Association, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;Rabin, A. T. 1988 "Determining difficulty levels of text written in languages other than English." In ''Readability: Its past, present, and future,'' eds. B. L. Zakaluk and S. J. Samuels. Newark, DE: International Reading Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 2000, there were over 1,000 studies on readability formulas in professional journals about their validity and merit.&lt;ref name="Klare2000"&gt;Klare, G. R. 2000. "Readable computer documentation." ''ACM journal of computer documentation" 24, no. 3: 148–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of reading is not just in teaching. Research has shown that much money is wasted by companies in making texts hard for the average reader to read.&lt;ref name="Kimble"&gt;Kimble, Joe. 1996–97. ''Writing for dollars. Writing to please.'' ''Scribes journal of legal writing'' 6. Available online at: [http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/kimble/dollars.htm   http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/kimble/dollars.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are summaries of this research; see the links in this section.  Many textbooks on reading include pointers to readability.&lt;ref name="Harris1985"&gt;Harris, A. J. and E. Sipay. 1985. ''How to increase reading ability, 8th Ed.'' New York &amp; London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruddell"&gt;Ruddell, R. B. 1999. ''Teaching children to read and write.'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manzo"&gt;Manzo, A. V. and U. C. Manzo. 1995. ''Teaching children to be literate.'' Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vacca"&gt;Vacca, J. A., R. Vacca, and M. K. Gove. 1995. ''Reading and learning to read.'' New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early research==
In the 1880s, English professor L. A. Sherman found that the English sentence was getting shorter. In [[Elizabethan]] times, the average sentence was 50 words long. In his own time, it was 23 words long.

Sherman's work established that:

* Literature is a subject for statistical analysis.
* Shorter sentences and concrete terms help people to make sense of what is written.
* Speech is easier to understand than text.
* Over time, text becomes easier if it is more like speech.

Sherman wrote: "Literary English, in short, will follow the forms of standard spoken English from which it comes. No man should talk worse than he writes, no man should write better than he should talk.... The oral sentence is clearest because it is the product of millions of daily efforts to be clear and strong. It represents the work of the race for thousands of years in perfecting an effective instrument of communication."&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;Sherman, Lucius Adelno 1893. ''Analytics of literature: A manual for the objective study of English prose and poetry." Boston: Ginn and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 in Russia, the writer Nikolai A. Rubakin published a study of over 10,000 texts written by everyday people.&lt;ref name="Choldin"/&gt; From these texts, he took 1,500 words he thought most people understood. He found that the main blocks to comprehension are ''unfamiliar words'' and ''long sentences''.&lt;ref name="Lorge1944a"&gt;Lorge, I. 1944. "Word lists as background for communication." ''Teachers College Record" 45:543–552.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with his own journal at the age of 13, Rubakin published many articles and books on science and many subjects for the great numbers of new readers throughout Russia. In Rubakin's view, the people were not fools. They were simply poor and in need of cheap books, written at a level they could grasp.&lt;ref name="Choldin"&gt;{{Citation | last = Choldin | first = M.T. | contribution = Rubakin, Nikolai Aleksandrovic | year = 1979 | title = Encyclopedia of library and information science | editor-last = Kent | editor-first = Allen | editor2-last = Lancour | editor2-first = Harold | editor3-last = Nasri | editor3-first = William Z. | editor4-last = Daily | editor4-first = Jay Elwood | volume = 26 | pages = 178–79 | publisher = CRC Press | edition = illustrated | isbn = 9780824720261 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hr1RHr8lRcUC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Harry D. Kitson published ''The Mind of the Buyer'', one of the first books to apply psychology to marketing. Kitson's work showed that each type of reader bought and read their own type of text. On reading two newspapers and two magazines, he found that short sentence length and short [[word length]] were the best contributors to reading ease.&lt;ref name="Kitson"&gt;Kitson, Harry D. 1921. ''The Mind of the Buyer.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text leveling==
The earliest reading ease assessment is the subjective judgment termed ''text leveling''.  Formulas do not fully address the various content, purpose, design, visual input, and organization of a text.&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;Clay, M. 1991. ''Becoming literate: The construction of inner control.''  Portsmouth, NH: Heinneman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frylevel"&gt;Fry, E. B. 2002. "Text readability versus leveling." ''Reading Teacher'' 56 no. 23:286–292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qualitative"&gt;Chall, J. S.,  J. L. Bissex, S. S. Conard, and S. H. Sharples. 1996. ''Qualitative assessment of text difficulty: A practical guide for teachers and writers.'' Cambridge MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Text leveling is commonly used to rank the reading ease of texts in areas where reading difficulties are easy to identify, such as books for young children. At higher levels, ranking reading ease becomes more difficult, as individual difficulties become harder to identify. This has led to better ways to assess reading ease.

==Vocabulary frequency lists==
In the 1920s, the scientific movement in education looked for tests to measure students' achievement to aid in curriculum development. Teachers and educators had long known that, to improve reading skill, readers—especially beginning readers—need reading material that closely matches their ability. University-based psychologists did much of the early research, which was later taken up by textbook publishers.&lt;ref name="fry"/&gt;

Educational psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] of Columbia University noted that, in Russia and Germany, teachers used word frequency counts to match books to students. Word skill was the best sign of intellectual development, and the strongest predictor of reading ease. In 1921, Thorndike published ''Teachers Word Book'', which contained the [[word frequency|frequencies]] of 10,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1921 ''The teacher's word book''. 1932 ''A teacher's word book of the twenty thousand words found most frequently and widely in general reading for children and young people''. 1944 (with J.E. Lorge) ''The teacher's word book of 30,000 words''.&lt;/ref&gt; It made it easier for teachers to choose books that matched class reading skills. It also provided a basis for future research on reading ease.

Until computers came along, word frequency lists were the best aids for grading reading ease of texts.&lt;ref name="KlareBuck"&gt;Klare, G. R. and B. Buck. 1954. ''Know Your Reader: The scientific approach to readability.'' New York: Heritage House.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the World Book Encyclopedia listed the grade levels of 44,000 words.&lt;ref name="livingword"&gt;Dale, E. and J. O'Rourke. 1981. ''The living word vocabulary: A national vocabulary inventory.'' World Book-Childcraft International.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early children's readability formulas==
In 1923, Bertha A. Lively and [[Sidney L. Pressey]] published the first reading ease  formula. They were concerned that junior high school science textbooks had so many technical words. They felt that teachers spent all class time explaining these words. They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the “vocabulary burden” of textbooks. Their formula used five variable inputs and six constants. For each thousand words, it counted the number of unique words, the number of words not on the Thorndike list, and the median index number of the words found on the list. Manually, it took three hours to apply the formula to a book.&lt;ref name="Lively"&gt;Lively, Bertha A. and S. L. Pressey. 1923. "A method for measuring the 'vocabulary burden' of textbooks. ''Educational administration and supervision" 9:389–398.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Lively–Pressey study, people looked for formulas that were more accurate and easier to apply. By 1980, over 200 formulas were published in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED490073.pdf]{{Cite book|title=The Principles of Readability|last=DuBay|first=William H|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=2004|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1928, Carleton Washburne and Mabel Vogel created the first modern readability formula. They validated it by using an outside criterion, and correlated .845 with test scores of students who read and liked the criterion books. It was also the first to introduce the variable of interest to the concept of readability.&lt;ref name="Washburne"&gt;Washburne, C. and M. Vogel. 1928. "An objective method of determining grade placement of children's reading material. ''Elementary school journal'' 28:373–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1929 and 1939, Alfred Lewerenz of the Los Angeles School District published several new formulas.&lt;ref name="Lewerenz1929a"&gt;Lewerenz, A. S.  1929. "Measurement of the difficulty of reading materials." ''Los Angeles educational research bulletin'' 8:11–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewerenz1929b"&gt;Lewerenz, A. S. 1929. "Objective measurement of diverse types of reading material. ''Los Angeles educational research bulletin'' 9:8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewerenz1930"&gt;Lewerenz, A. S.  1930. "Vocabulary grade placement of typical newspaper content." ''Los Angeles educational research bulletin'' 10:4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewerenz1935"&gt;Lewerenz, A. S.  1935. "A vocabulary grade placement formula." ''Journal of experimental education'' 3: 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewerenz1939"&gt;Lewerenz, A. S. 1939. "Selection of reading materials by pupil ability and interest." 'Elementary English review'' 16:151–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Edward Thorndike published his formula. He wrote that word skills can be increased if the teacher introduces new words and repeats them often.&lt;ref name="Thorn2"&gt;Thorndike, E. 1934. "Improving the ability to read." ''Teachers college record'' 36:1–19, 123–44, 229–41. October, November, December.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, W.W. Patty and W. I Painter published a formula for measuring the vocabulary burden of textbooks. This was the last of the early formulas that used the Thorndike vocabulary-frequency list.&lt;ref name="Patty"&gt;Patty. W. W. and W. I. Painter. 1931. "A technique for measuring the vocabulary burden of textbooks." ''Journal of educational research'' 24:127–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adult readability formulas==
During the recession of the 1930s, the U.S. government invested in [[adult education]]. In 1931, [[Douglas Waples]] and [[Ralph W. Tyler|Ralph Tyler]] published ''What Adults Want to Read About.'' It was a two-year study of adult reading interests. Their book showed not only what people read but what they would like to read. They found that many readers lacked suitable reading materials: they would have liked to learn but the reading materials were too hard for them.&lt;ref name="Waples"&gt;Waples, D. and R. Tyler. 1931. ''What adults want to read about.''Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyman Bryson]] of [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] found that many adults had poor reading ability due to poor education. Even though [[college]]s  had long tried to teach how to write in a clear and readable style, Bryson found that it was rare. He wrote that such language is the result of a "...[[discipline]] and artistry that few people who have ideas will take the trouble to achieve... If simple language were easy, many of our problems would have been solved long ago."&lt;ref name="KlareBuck"/&gt; Bryson helped set up the Readability Laboratory at the College. Two of his students were Irving Lorge and [[Rudolf Flesch]].

In 1934, Ralph Ojemann investigated adult reading skills, factors that most directly affect reading ease, and causes of each level of difficulty. He did not invent a formula, but a method for assessing the difficulty of materials for [[parent education]]. He was the first to assess the validity of this method by using 16 magazine passages tested on actual readers. He evaluated 14 measurable and three reported factors that affect reading ease.

Ojemann emphasized the reported features, such as whether the text was coherent or unduly abstract. He used his 16 passages to compare and judge the reading ease of other texts, a method now called ''scaling''. He showed that even though these factors cannot be measured, they cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name="Ojemann"&gt;Ojemann, R. H. 1934. "The reading ability of parents and factors associated with reading difficulty of parent-education materials." ''University of Iowa studies in child welfare'' 8:11–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1934, [[Ralph W. Tyler|Ralph Tyler]] and [[Edgar Dale]] published the first adult reading ease formula based on passages on health topics from a variety of textbooks and magazines. Of 29 factors that are significant for young readers, they found ten that are significant for adults. They used three of these in their formula.&lt;ref name="DaleTyler"&gt;Dale, E. and R. Tyler. 1934. "A study of the factors influencing the difficulty of reading materials for adults of limited reading ability." ''Library quarterly'' 4:384–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, [[William S. Gray]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and Bernice Leary of [[Saint Xavier University|Xavier College in Chicago]] published ''What Makes a Book Readable,'' one of the most important books in readability research. Like Dale and Tyler, they focused on what makes books readable for adults of limited reading ability. Their book included the first scientific study of the reading skills of American adults. The sample included 1,690 adults from a variety of settings and regions. The test used a number of passages from [[newspaper]]s, magazines, and books—as well as a standard reading test. They found a mean grade score of 7.81 (eighth month of the [[seventh grade]]). About one-third read at the 2nd to 6th-[[grade level]], one-third at the 7th to 12th-grade level, and one-third at the 13th–17th grade level.

The authors emphasized that one-half of the adult population at that time lacked suitable reading materials. They wrote, "For them, the enriching values of reading are denied unless materials reflecting adult interests are adapted to their needs." The poorest readers, one-sixth of the adult population, need "simpler materials for use in promoting functioning [[literacy]] and in establishing fundamental reading habits."&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, W. S. and B. Leary. 1935. ''What makes a book readable''. Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray and Leary then analyzed 228 variables that affect reading ease and divided them into four types:
# Content
# Style
# Format
# Organization
They found that content was most important, followed closely by style. Third was format, followed closely by organization. They found no way to measure content, format, or organization—but they could measure variables of style. Among the 17 significant measurable style variables, they selected five to create a formula:
* Average [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence length]]
* Number of different hard words
* Number of [[personal pronoun]]s
* Percentage of unique words
* Number of [[prepositional phrase]]s
Their formula had a [[correlation]] of .645 with [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] as measured by reading tests given to about 800 adults.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

In 1939, Irving Lorge published an article that reported other combinations of variables that indicate difficulty more accurately than the ones Gray and Leary used. His research also showed that, "The vocabulary load is the most important concomitant of difficulty."&lt;ref name="Lorge1939"&gt;Lorge, I. 1939. "Predicting reading difficulty of selections for children. ''Elementary English Review'' 16:229–233.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Lorge published his ''Lorge Index'', a readability formula that used three variables and set the stage for simpler and more reliable formulas that followed.&lt;ref name="Lorge1944b"&gt;Lorge, I. 1944. "Predicting readability." ''Teachers college record'' 45:404–419.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940, investigators had:
* Successfully used statistical methods to analyze reading ease
* Found that unusual words and sentence length were among the first causes of reading difficulty
* Used vocabulary and sentence length in formulas to predict reading ease

===The Flesch formulas===
{{Main|Flesch–Kincaid readability tests}}
In 1943, Rudolf Flesch published his PhD dissertation, ''Marks of a Readable Style'', which included a readability formula to predict the difficulty of adult reading material. Investigators in many fields began using it to improve communications. One of the variables it used was ''personal references,'' such as names and personal pronouns. Another variable was ''affixes''.&lt;ref name="FleschStyle"&gt;Flesch, R. "Marks of a readable style." ''Columbia University contributions to education,'' no. 187. New York: Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Flesch published his [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests|Reading Ease]] formula in two parts. Rather than using grade levels, it used a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 equivalent to the 12th grade and 100 equivalent to the 4th grade. It dropped the use of affixes. The second part of the formula predicts human interest by using personal references and the number of personal sentences. The new formula correlated 0.70 with the McCall-Crabbs reading tests.&lt;ref name="FleschEase"&gt;Flesch, R. 1948. "A new readability yardstick." ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' 32:221–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The original formula is:

:Reading Ease score = 206.835 &amp;minus; (1.015 &amp;times; ASL) &amp;minus; (84.6 &amp;times; ASW)
::Where: ASL = average sentence length (number of words divided by number of sentences)
:: ASW = average word length in syllables (number of syllables divided by number of words)

Publishers  discovered that the Flesch formulas could increase readership up to 60 percent. Flesch's work also made an enormous impact on journalism. The Flesch Reading Ease formula became one of the most widely-used, tested, and reliable readability metrics.&lt;ref name="Klare63"&gt;Klare, G. R. 1963. ''The measurement of readability''. Ames, Iowa: University of Iowa Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chall"&gt;Chall, J. S. 1958. ''Readability: An appraisal of research and application.'' Columbus, OH: Bureau of Educational Research, Ohio State University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Farr, Jenkins, and Patterson simplified the formula further by changing the syllable count. The modified formula is:

:New reading ease score = 1.599nosw &amp;minus; 1.015sl &amp;minus; 31.517
::Where: nosw = number of one-syllable words per 100 words and
::sl = average sentence length in words.&lt;ref name="Farr"&gt;Farr, J. N., J. J. Jenkins, and D. G. Paterson. 1951. "Simplification of the Flesch Reading Ease Formula." ''Journal of Applied Psychology.'' 35, no. 5:333–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, in a project sponsored by the U.S. Navy, the Reading Ease formula was recalculated to give a grade-level score. The new formula is now called the [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests|Flesch–Kincaid grade-level]] formula.&lt;ref name="Kincaid"&gt;Kincaid, J. P., R. P. Fishburne, R. L. Rogers, and B. S. Chissom. 1975. ''Derivation of new readability formulas (Automated Readability Index, Fog Count, and Flesch Reading Ease Formula) for Navy enlisted personnel.'' CNTECHTRA Research Branch Report 8-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flesch–Kincaid formula is one of the most popular and heavily tested formulas. It correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt;

===The Dale–Chall formula===
{{Main|Dale–Chall readability formula}}
[[Edgar Dale]], a professor of education at Ohio State University, was one of the first critics of Thorndike's vocabulary-frequency lists. He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have. He created two new lists of his own. One, his "short list" of 769 easy words, was used by Irving Lorge in his formula. The other was his "long list" of 3,000 easy words, which were understood by 80% of fourth-grade students. In 1948, he incorporated this list into a formula he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who later founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory.

To apply the formula:

# Select several 100-word samples throughout the text.
# Compute the average sentence length in words (divide the number of words by the number of sentences).
# Compute the percentage of words NOT on the Dale–Chall word list of 3,000 easy words.
# Compute this equation
#: Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) + 3.6365

Where:
:Raw score = uncorrected reading grade of a student who can answer one-half of the test questions on a passage.
:PDW = Percentage of difficult words not on the Dale–Chall word list.
:ASL = Average sentence length

Finally, to compensate for the "grade-equivalent curve," apply the following chart for the Final Score:
{{Aligned table

|Raw score |           Final score
|4.9 and below |    Grade 4 and below

|6.0–6.9 |            Grades 7–8
|7.0–7.9 |            Grades 9–10
|8.0–8.9 |            Grades 11–12
|9.0–9.9 |            Grades 13–15 (college)
|10 and above |      Grades  16 and above.}}&lt;ref name="Dale-Chall"&gt;Dale, E. and J. S. Chall. 1948. '"A formula for predicting readability". ''Educational research bulletin'' Jan. 21 and Feb 17, 27:1–20, 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correlating 0.93 with comprehension as measured by reading tests, the Dale–Chall formula is the most reliable formula and is widely used in scientific research.

In 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list, the New Dale–Chall readability formula.&lt;ref name="Dale-Chall2"&gt;Chall, J. S. and E. Dale. 1995. ''Readability revisited: The new Dale–Chall readability formula.'' Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gunning fog formula===
{{Main|Gunning fog index}}
In the 1940s, Robert Gunning helped bring readability research into the workplace. In 1944, he founded the first readability consulting firm dedicated to reducing the "fog" in newspapers and business writing. In 1952, he published ''The Technique of Clear Writing'' with his own Fog Index, a formula that correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt; The formula is one of the most reliable and simplest to apply:

:Grade level= 0.4 * ( (average sentence length) + (percentage of Hard Words) )

:Where: Hard Words = words with more than two syllables.&lt;ref name="Gunning"&gt;Gunning, R. 1952. ''The Technique of Clear Writing." New York: McGraw–Hill."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fry readability graph===
{{Main|Fry readability formula}}
In 1963, while teaching English teachers in Uganda, Edward Fry developed his [[Fry readability formula|Readability Graph]]. It became one of the most popular formulas and easiest to apply.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;Fry, E. B. 1963. ''Teaching faster reading." London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fry2"&gt;Fry, E. B. 1968. "A readability formula that saves time." '' Journal of reading '' 11:513–516.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fry Graph correlates 0.86 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt;

===McLaughlin's SMOG formula===
{{Main|SMOG}}
Harry McLaughlin  determined that word length and sentence length should be multiplied rather than added as in other formulas. In 1969, he published his SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) formula:

:SMOG grading = 3 + {{Sqrt|polysyllable count}}.

:Where: polysyllable count = number of words of more than two syllables in a sample of 30 sentences.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin1969" /&gt;

The SMOG formula correlates 0.88 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt; It is often recommended for use in healthcare.&lt;ref name="Doak"&gt;Doak, C. C., L. G. Doak, and J. H. Root. 1996. ''Teaching patients with low literacy skills''. Philadelphia: J. P. Lippincott Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The FORCAST formula &lt;!-- [[FORCAST]] redirects here. Please update it if you rename this section. --&gt;===
In 1973, a study commissioned by the US military of the reading skills required for different military jobs produced the FORCAST formula. Unlike most other formulas, it uses only a vocabulary element, making it useful for texts without complete sentences. The formula satisfied requirements that it would be:
* Based on Army-job reading materials.
* Suitable for the young adult-male recruits.
* Easy enough for Army clerical personnel to use without special training or equipment.

The formula is:

:Grade level = 20 &amp;minus; (''N'' / 10)

:Where N = number of single-syllable words in a 150-word sample.&lt;ref name="forcast"&gt;Caylor, J. S., T. G. Stitch, L. C. Fox, and J. P. Ford. 1973.  ''Methodologies for determining reading requirements of military occupational specialties: Technical report No. 73-5''. Alexander, VA: [[Human Resources Research Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The FORCAST formula correlates 0.66 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt;

=== The Golub Syntactic Density Score ===
The Golub Syntactic Density Score was developed by Lester Golub in 1974. It is among a smaller subset of readability formulas that concentrate on the syntactic features of a text. To calculate the reading level of a text, a sample of several hundred words is taken from the text. The number of words in the sample is counted, as are the number of T-units. A T-unit is defined as an independent clause and any dependent clauses attached to it. Other syntactical units are then counted and entered into the following table:

  1.   Words/T-unit                                           .95  X _________  ___
  
  2.   Subordinate clauses/T-unit                             .90  X _________  ___
  
  3.   Main clause word length (mean)                         .20  X _________  ___
  
  4.   Subordinate clause length (mean)                       .50  X _________  ___
  
  5.   Number of Modals (will, shall, can, may, must, would…) .65  X _________  ___
  
  6.   Number of ''Be'' and ''Have'' forms in the auxiliary           .40  X _________  ___
  
  7.   Number of Prepositional Phrases                        .75  X _________  ___
  
  8.   Number of Possessive nouns and pronouns                .70  X _________  ___
  
  9.   Number of Adverbs of Time (when, then, once, while…)   .60  X _________  ___
  
 10.   Number of gerunds, participles, and absolutes Phrases  .85  X _________  ___

Users add the numbers in the right hand column and divide the total by the number of T-units. Finally, the quotient is entered into the following table to arrive at a final readability score.

===Readability and newspaper readership===
Several studies in the 1940s showed that even small increases in readability greatly increases readership in large-circulation newspapers.

In 1947, Donald Murphy of ''Wallace's Farmer'' used a split-run edition to study the effects of making text easier to read. They found that reducing  from the 9th to the 6th-grade level increased readership 43% for an article on 'nylon'. There was a gain of 42,000 readers in a circulation of 275,000. He found a 60% increase in readership for an article on 'corn'. He also found a better response from people under 35.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy, D. 1947. "How plain talk increases readership 45% to 60%." ''Printer's ink.'' 220:35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber Schramm interviewed 1,050 newspaper readers. He found that an easier reading style helps to decide how much of an article is read. This was called reading persistence, depth, or perseverance. He also found that people will read less of long articles than of short ones. A story 9 paragraphs long will lose three out of 10 readers by the 5th paragraph. A shorter story will lose only two. Schramm also found that the use of subheads, bold-face paragraphs, and stars to break up a story actually lose readers.&lt;ref name="Schramm"&gt;Schramm, W. 1947. "Measuring another dimension of newspaper readership." ''Journalism quarterly'' 24:293–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 1947 by Melvin Lostutter showed that newspapers generally were written at a level five years above the ability of average American adult readers. He also found that the reading ease of newspaper articles had little to do with the education, experience, or personal interest of the journalists writing the stories. It had more to do with the convention and culture of the industry. Lostutter argued for more readability testing in newspaper writing. He wrote that improved readability must be a "conscious process somewhat independent of the education and experience of the staff''s writers."&lt;ref name="Lostutter"&gt;Lostutter, M. 1947. "Some critical factors in newspaper readability." ''Journalism quarterly'' 24:307–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Charles Swanson in 1948 showed that better readability increases the total number of paragraphs read by 93% and the number of readers reading every paragraph by 82%.&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;Swanson, C. E. 1948. "Readability and readership: A controlled experiment." ''Journalism quarterly'' 25:339–343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Bernard Feld did a study of every item and ad in the ''Birmingham News'' of 20 November 1947. He divided the items into those above the 8th-grade level and those at the 8th grade or below. He chose the 8th-grade breakpoint because that was the average reading level of adult readers. An 8th-grade text "...will reach about 50 percent of all American grown-ups," he wrote. Among the wire-service stories, the lower group got two-thirds more readers, and among local stories, 75 percent more readers. Feld also believed in drilling writers in Flesch's clear-writing principles.&lt;ref name="Feld"&gt;Feld, B. 1948. "Empirical test proves clarity adds readers." ''Editor and publisher'' 81:38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning worked extensively with newspapers and the wire services in improving readability. Mainly through their efforts in a few years, the readability of US newspapers went from the 16th to the 11th-grade level, where it remains today.

The two publications with the largest circulations, ''TV Guide'' (13 million) and ''Readers Digest'' (12 million), are written at the 9th-grade level.&lt;ref name="DuBay"/&gt; The most popular novels are written at the 7th-grade level. This supports the fact that the average adult reads at the 9th-grade level. It also shows that, for recreation, people read  texts that are two grades below their actual reading level.&lt;ref name="KlareBuck"/&gt;

===The George Klare studies===
George Klare and his colleagues looked at the effects of greater reading ease on Air Force recruits. They found that more readable texts resulted in greater and more complete learning. They also increased the amount read in a given time, and made for easier acceptance.&lt;ref name="Klare55"&gt;Klare, G. R., J. E. Mabry, and L. M. Gustafson. 1955. "The relationship of style difficulty to immediate retention and to acceptability of technical material." ''Journal of educational psychology'' 46:287–295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klare55a"&gt;Klare, G. R., E. H. Shuford, and W. H. Nichols. 1957 . "The relationship of style difficulty, practice, and efficiency of reading and retention." ''Journal of Applied Psychology.'' 41:222–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies by Klare showed how the reader's skills,&lt;ref name="Klare76"&gt;Klare, G. R. 1976. "A second look at the validity of the readability formulas." ''Journal of reading behavior.'' 8:129–52.&lt;/ref&gt; prior knowledge,&lt;ref name="Klare85"&gt;Klare, G. R. 1985. "Matching reading materials to readers: The role of readability estimates in conjunction with other information about comprehensibility." In ''Reading, thinking, and concept development,'' eds. T. L Harris and E. J. Cooper. New York: College Entrance Examination Board.&lt;/ref&gt; interest, and motivation&lt;ref name="Klare76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klare85"/&gt; affect reading ease.

===Measuring coherence and organization===
For centuries, teachers and educators have seen the importance of organization, coherence, and emphasis in good writing. Beginning in the 1970s, cognitive theorists began teaching that reading is really an act of thinking and organization. The reader constructs meaning by mixing new knowledge into existing knowledge. Because of the limits of the reading ease formulas, some research looked at ways to measure the content, organization, and coherence of text. Although this did not improve the reliability of the formulas, their efforts showed the importance of these variables in reading ease.

Studies by [[Walter Kintch]] and others showed the central role of coherence in reading ease, mainly for people learning to read.&lt;ref name="Kintsch"&gt;Kintsch, W. and J. R. Miller 1981. "Readability: A view from cognitive psychology." In ''Teaching: Research reviews.'' Newark, DE: International Reading Assn.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, 'Susan Kemper devised a formula based on physical states and mental states. However, she found this was no better than word familiarity and sentence length in showing reading ease.&lt;ref name="Kemper"&gt;Kemper, S. 1983. "Measuring the inference load of a text." ''Journal of educational psychology'' 75, no. 3:391–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonnie Meyer and others tried to use organization as a measure of reading ease. While this did not result in a formula, they showed that people read faster and retain more when the text is organized  in topics. She found that a visible plan for presenting content greatly helps readers to assess a text. A hierarchical plan shows how the parts of the text are related. It also aids the reader in blending new information into existing knowledge structures.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, B. J. 1982. "Reading research and the teacher: The importance of plans." ''College composition and communication'' 33, no. 1:37–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonnie Armbruster found that the most important feature for learning and comprehension is textual coherence, which comes in two types:
*Global coherence, which integrates high-level ideas as themes in an entire section, chapter, or book.
*Local coherence, which joins ideas within and between sentences.

Armbruster confirmed Kintsch's finding that coherence and structure are more help for younger readers.&lt;ref name="Armbruster"&gt;Armbruster, B. B. 1984. "The problem of inconsiderate text" In ''Comprehension instruction'', ed. G. Duffy. New York: Longmann, p. 202–217.&lt;/ref&gt; R. C. Calfee and R. Curley built on Bonnie Meyer's work and found that an unfamiliar underlying structure can make even simple text hard to read. They brought in a graded system to help students progress from simpler story lines to more advanced and abstract ones.&lt;ref name="Calfee"&gt;Calfee, R. C. and R. Curley. 1984. "Structures of prose in content areas." In ''Understanding reading comprehension'', ed. J. Flood. Newark, DE: International Reading Assn., pp. 414–430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies looked at the effects on reading ease of other text variables, including:
* Image words, abstraction, direct and indirect statements, types of narration and sentences, phrases, and clauses.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;
* Difficult concepts.&lt;ref name="Chall"/&gt;

==Advanced readability formulas==

===The John Bormuth formulas===
John Bormuth of the University of Chicago looked at reading ease using the new [[Cloze test|Cloze deletion test]] developed by Wilson Taylor. His work supported earlier research including the degree of reading ease for each kind of reading. The best level for classroom "assisted reading" is a slightly difficult text that causes a "set to learn," and for which readers can correctly answer 50 percent of the questions of a multiple-choice test. The best level for unassisted reading is one for which readers can correctly answer 80 percent of the questions. These cutoff scores were later confirmed by Vygotsky&lt;ref name="Vygotsky"&gt;Vygotsky, L. 1978. ''Mind in society.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chall and Conard.&lt;ref name="ChallConard"&gt;Chall, J. S. and S. S. Conard. 1991. ''Should textbooks challenge students? The case for easier or harder textbooks.'' New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other things, Bormuth confirmed that vocabulary and sentence length are the best indicators of reading ease. He showed that the measures of reading ease worked as well for adults as for children. The same things that children find hard are the same for adults of the same reading levels. He also developed several new measures of cutoff scores. One of the most well known was the ''Mean Cloze Formula'', which was used in 1981 to produce the ''Degree of Reading Power'' system used by the College Entrance Examination Board.&lt;ref name="Bormuth"&gt;Bormuth, J. R. 1966. "Readability: A new approach." ''Reading research quarterly 1:79–132.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bormuth2"&gt;Bormuth, J. R. 1969.

In 1988, Jack Stenner and his associates at MetaMetrics, Inc. published a new system, the [[Lexile|Lexile Framework]], for assessing readability and matching students with appropriate texts.

The Lexile framework uses average sentence length, and average word frequency in the American Heritage Intermediate Corpus to predict a score on a 0–2000 scale. The AHI Corpus includes five million words from 1,045 published works often read by students in grades three to nine.&lt;!--what's this trying to say?--&gt;

The Lexile Book Database has more than 100,000 titles from more than 450 publishers. By knowing a student's Lexile score, a teacher can find books that match his or her reading level.&lt;ref name="Stenner"&gt;Stenner, A. J., I Horabin, D. R. Smith, and R. Smith. 1988. ''The Lexile Framework.'' Durham, NC: Metametrics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATOS readability formula for books===
In 2000, researchers of the School Renaissance Institute and Touchstone Applied Science Associates published their Advantage-TASA Open Standard (ATOS) Reading ease Formula for Books. They worked on a formula that was easy to use and that could be used with any  texts.

The project was one of the widest reading ease projects ever. The developers of the formula used 650 normed reading texts, 474 million words from all the text in 28,000 books read by students. The project also used the reading records of more than 30,000 who read and were tested on 950,000 books.

They found that three variables give the most reliable measure of text reading ease:

*words per sentence
*average grade level of words
*characters per word

They also found that:

*To help learning, the teacher should match book reading ease with reading skill.
*Reading often helps with reading gains.
*For reading alone below the 4th grade, the best learning gain requires at least 85% comprehension.
*Advanced readers need 92% comprehension for independent reading.
*Book length can be a good measure of reading ease.
*Feedback and interaction with the teacher are the most important factors in reading.&lt;ref name="atos"&gt;School Renaissance Institute. 2000. ''The ATOS readability formula for books and how it compares to other formulas.'' Madison, WI: School Renaissance Institute, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, T. 2003. ''Guided independent reading.'' Madison, WI: School Renaissance Institute, Inc. [http://www.renlearn.com/GIRP2008.pdf  http://www.renlearn.com/GIRP2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===CohMetrix psycholinguistics measurements===
[[Coh-Metrix]] can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the mental representation of the text. "Our definition of [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text."&lt;ref name="graesser2003"&gt;{{Citation | last = Graesser | first = A.C. | last2 = McNamara | first2 = D.S. | last3 = Louwerse | first3 = M.M. | editor-last = Sweet | editor-first = A.P. | editor2-last = Snow | editor2-first = C.E. | year = 2003 | title = What do readers need to learn in order to process coherence relations in narrative and expository text | work = Rethinking reading comprehension | publisher = Guilford Publications | publication-place = New York | pages = 82–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate. Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.&lt;ref name="graesser2003"/&gt;

==Using the readability formulas==
While experts agree that the formulas are highly accurate for grading the readability of existing texts, they are not so useful for creating or modifying them. The two variables used in most formulas, a sentence and a vocabulary, are the ones most directly related to reading difficulty, but they are not the only ones.

Writing experts have warned that an attempt to simplify the text only by changing the length of the words and sentences may result in text that is more difficult to read. All the variables are tightly related. If one is changed, the others must also be adjusted, including approach, voice, person, tone, typography, design, and organization.

Writing for a class of readers other than one's own is very difficult. It takes training, method, and practice. Among those who are good at this are writers of novels and children's books. The writing experts all advise that, besides using a formula, observe all the norms of good writing, which are essential for writing readable texts. Writers should study the texts used by their audience and their reading habits. This means that for a 5th-grade audience, the writer should study and learn good quality 5th-grade materials.&lt;ref name="KlareBuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleschwrite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FleschArt"&gt;Flesch, R. 1946.

[[Image:Alan Turing Building Manchester from Upper Brook St July 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Alan Turing Building. Home of the School of Mathematics from July 2007]]
The '''School of Mathematics''' at the [[University of Manchester]] is one of the largest
&lt;ref name="location"&gt;Certainly the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge]] is larger. Exact figures for Cambridge are hard to come by as the faculty is divided into [[DPMMS]] and [[DAMTP]] (which includes some physicists). In the 2001 RAE Cambridge returned 60 applied mathematicians and 38 pure mathematicians as lecturers and professors. In any measure Cambridge is bigger. Oxfords 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] return {{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203002456/http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }} lists 43 pure, 32 applied and also 12 statisticians making it slightly larger than and the size may have increased. Probably the next biggest after Manchester is Leeds with about 70 academic staff over pure, applied and statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics departments in the United Kingdom, with around 80 academic staff and an undergraduate intake of roughly 400 a year (including students studying mathematics with a minor in another subject)&lt;ref&gt;League Tables of UK Mathematics Departments, [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~bl/maths_league/uk-maths-league-tables.html] gives more details of size.&lt;/ref&gt; and another 200 postgraduate students. The school was formed in 2004 by the merger of the mathematics departments of [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] (UMIST) and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] (VUM).  In July 2007 the school moved from the [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] into a purpose-designed building – the first three floors of the [[Alan Turing Building]] – on Upper Brook Street.

==Organization==
[[Image:Alan Turing building atrium July 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The atrium of the Alan Turing Building]]
The current head of the school is [[Peter Duck (mathematician)|Peter Duck]]. The school is divided, mainly for the purposes of teaching administration, into three groups: ''Pure Mathematics'' headed by Mark Kambites, ''Applied Mathematics'' headed by Oliver Jensen, and ''Probability and Statistics'' headed by Goran Peskir. The Manchester Institute for Mathematical Sciences (MIMS) is a unit of the school focusing on the organising of mathematical colloquia and conferences, and research visitors. MIMS is headed by [[Nicholas Higham|Nick Higham]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], who is also Director of Research. Other high-profile mathematicians at Manchester include Sir [[Martin J. Taylor|Martin Taylor]] FRS and [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Jeff Paris]] (Fellow of the [[British Academy]])

Since its formation, the school has made some influential appointments including the [[Topology|topologist]] [[Viktor Buchstaber]] (a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]) and [[Model theory|model theorist]] [[Alex Wilkie]] FRS. Numerical analyst [[Jack Dongarra]], famous as one of the authors of [[LINPACK]], was appointed in 2007 as Turing Fellow. In the autumn of 2007 another corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences [[Albert Shiryaev]] was appointed to a 20% chair. Shiryaev is famous for his work on probability theory (he was a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]) and for his work on [[financial mathematics]].

==Research==

As might be expected from its size, the school has a wide range of research interests, including the traditionally pure areas of [[Algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]], [[Noncommutative geometry]], [[Ergodic theory]], [[Mathematical logic]], [[Number theory]], [[Geometry]] and [[Topology]]; and the more applied [[Dynamical system]], [[Fluid dynamics]], [[Solid mechanics]], [[Inverse problem]]s, [[Mathematical finance]], [[Wave propagation]] and [[Scattering]]. The school also has a strong tradition in [[Numerical analysis]] and well established groups in [[Probability theory]], and [[Mathematical statistics]].

Manchester mathematicians have a long tradition of applying mathematics to industrial problems. Nowadays this involves not only the traditional applications in engineering and the physical sciences, but also in the life sciences and the financial sector. Some of the recent industrial partners include [[Qinetiq]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Numerical Algorithms Group|NAg]], [[MathWorks]], [[Comsol]], [[Philips]] Labs, [[Thales Underwater Systems]], [[Rapiscan Systems]] and [[Schlumberger]].

===Research Assessment Exercise (2008)===


The School of Mathematics entered research into three units of assessment. In Pure Mathematics 20% of submissions from 27 FTE category A staff were rated 4* (World Class) and 40% 3* (Internationally Excellent). In Applied Mathematics 25% of submissions from 28.8 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*. And in Statistics and Operational Research, 20% of submissions from 10.9 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*.&lt;ref name="RAE 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Assessment Exercise 2008|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/Submissions/submissions.aspx?id=163&amp;type=hei|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of merger the two departments that came together to form the school were of roughly equal sizes and academic strengths, and already had a substantial record of collaboration including shared research seminar programmes and fourth year undergraduate and MSc programmes.

Many famous mathematicians have worked at the precursor departments to the school.

In 1885 [[Horace Lamb]], famous for his contribution to [[fluid dynamics]] accepted a chair at the VUM and under his leadership the department grew rapidly. Newman wrote:

:'His lecture courses were numerous, and his books provide a record of his methods. Many of his students were engineers, and they found in him a sympathetic guide, one who understood their difficulties and shared their interest in applications of mathematics to mechanics.'

In 1907 famous analyst and number theorist [[John Edensor Littlewood]] was appointed to the [[Richardson Chair of Applied Mathematics|Richardson Lectureship]] which he held for three years.

During 1912–1913 the pioneer of weather forecasting and numerical analysis [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] worked at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|Manchester College of Science and Technology]] (later to become UMIST). Number theorist [[Louis J. Mordell]] joined the College in 1920. During this time he discovered the result for which he is best known, namely the finite basis theorem (or [[Mordell–Weil theorem]]), which proved a conjecture of [[Henri Poincaré]]. Mordell then went on to become Fielden Reader in Pure Mathematics at VUM in 1922 and then held the Fielden Chair in 1923. Mordell built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in [[Reinhold Baer]], [[G. Billing]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Chao Ko]], [[Kurt Mahler]], and [[Beniamino Segre]]. He also recruited [[J. A. Todd]], [[Patrick du Val]], [[Harold Davenport]], [[L. C. Young]], and invited distinguished visitors. 

Although Manchester was later to be known as the birthplace of the electronic computer, [[Douglas Hartree]] made an earlier contribution building a [[differential analyser]] in 1933. The machine was used for [[ballistics]] calculations as well calculating railway timetables.

Mordell was succeeded by the famous topologist and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] [[Max Newman]] in 1945 who, as head of department, transformed it into a centre of international renown.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ledermann, Encounters of a Mathematician, 2009 {{isbn|978-1-4092-8267-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate numbers increased from eight per year to 40 and then 60. In 1948 Newman recruited [[Alan Turing]] as Reader in the department, and he worked there until his death in 1954, completing some of his profound work on the foundations of computer science including ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]''. Newman retired in 1964. From 1949 to 1960 [[M. S. Bartlett]] held the first chair in [[mathematical statistics]] at VUM, he is known for his contribution to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns, the theory of [[statistical inference]] and in [[multivariate analysis]]. At Manchester he developed an interest in [[epidemiology]], building a strong group in mathematical statistics and strengthening the department.

[[Image:Maths Tower, University of Manchester 2.jpg|thumb|left|The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] prior to its demolition]]

[[Fluid dynamics|Fluid dynamicist]] [[Sydney Goldstein]] held the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] from 1945 to 1950, and was succeeded from 1950 to 1959 by [[James Lighthill]], also a fluid dynamicist. In pure mathematics, [[Bernhard Neumann]], an influential [[group theory|group theorist]], joined the department at VUM in 1948, leaving as a Reader in 1961 to take a chair in Australia. In 1969, VUM's [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]], an 18-storey skyscraper on Oxford Road, was completed. 

[[Image:Frank Bowman UMIST Mathematician oil portrait.jpg|right|thumb|Frank Bowman was the longest serving head of Mathematics at UMIST: 1933–1957. This portrait was presented to the department by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]]]
Up until the 1950s, UMIST's Mathematics Department taught largely service courses for the engineering and applied science courses, and despite stars such as Richardson, Mordell and in 1958–1963 group theorist [[Hanna Neumann]], did not have a strong focus on research.  Neumann was later to be the first woman appointed to a Professorial Chair of Mathematics in Australia. 

[[Image:Maths and Social Science Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Maths and Social Sciences Building, which housed the UMIST Department of Mathematics from 1968 until merger, and part of the merged School until the opening of the Alan Turing Building in July 2007]]

With the rapid expansion of higher education and the starting of an undergraduate mathematics degree this changed, and by 1968 the 15-storey [[Maths and Social Sciences Building]] (MSS) was completed on UMIST campus to house the growing department. In 1960 [[Robin Bullough]] joined the UMIST department initiating four decades of mathematical physics focusing especially on [[soliton]]s. The statistics group also grew in strength with an emphasis on [[time series]], led by [[Maurice Priestley]] and also [[Tata Subba Rao]]. In 1986 pure mathematics at UMIST was strengthened by the appointment of [[Martin J. Taylor]] FRS, famous for his work on properties and structures of [[algebraic numbers]].

Another renowned topologist, [[Frank Adams]], succeeded Newman in the Fielden Chair, which he held from 1964 to 1970.

The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics tower]] was demolished in 2005, with most of the staff moving to temporary buildings, the pure mathematicians to one named after Newman and the applied to one named after Lamb. The history of the School entered a new phase in July 2007 with the move to the Alan Turing Building.

A '''sports school''' ({{lang-ru|Детско-Юношеская Спортивная Школа, ДЮСШ}}) is a type of educational institution for children that originated in the [[Soviet Union]]. Sports schools were the basis of the powerful system of physical culture (fitness) and sports education in the USSR and the [[Eastern Bloc]], particularly [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faupel|first1=Sarah|title=Germany's elite schools nurture sports stars in the making |url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-elite-schools-nurture-sports-stars-in-the-making/a-5938501|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=29 August 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Philip|title=Some of the Elements of the Disgraced East German Sports Machine Remain Part of the Training Culture of the United Nation|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-09-12/sports/0009120168_1_east-german-sports-sports-research-center-berlin-wall|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=12 September 2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main features of this system remain in the system of sports education in [[Russia]] and other post-Soviet states, and also became the basis of similar systems in other countries, one of the most powerful ones at the present time being that of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-9-2004-61432.asp Sam Wollaston on China's Sports Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; Many legendary athletes, such as [[Nikolai Andrianov]], [[Nellie Kim]], [[Alexander Popov (swimmer)|Alexander Popov]], [[Viktor Krovopuskov]], [[Vladislav Tretiak]], [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Anatoly Alyabyev]] and [[Sergey Bubka]] started their path to [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] success from Soviet sports schools.

==Establishment and early years==
The system of sports schools was founded in the 1930s. In 1934, [[Young Pioneers Stadium]] was built in [[Moscow]], the first specialized sports extracurricular institution in the USSR. In the same year the first children's collective was established by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]]; this was a prototype of sports schools by [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the USSR|sports societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html Ого Вфсо "Динамо" - Всероссийское Физкультурно-Спортивное Общество "Динамо"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220165626/http://dynamo.org.ru/history/99.html |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935-1936, the first sports schools were opened in Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and other cities of the USSR; they were created and functioned on the basis of regulations, approved by the Central Soviet of Sports Societies and Organizations of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educom.ru/ru/publications/press/system/review.php Хрнпхвеяйхи Нагнп Бнгмхймнбемхъ Х Пюгбхрхъ Яхярелш Бмеьйнкэмнцн Напюгнбюмхъ Б Лняйбе - Деоюпрюлемр Напюгнбюмхъ Ц. Лняйбш&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s dozens of schools functioned in the USSR by [[Dynamo (sports society)|Dynamo sports society]], [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak sports society]], [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CDKA]], sports societies of Trade Unions, [[OSOAVIAKHIM]] and in the system of education. After the [[Great Patriotic War]], sports schools were frequently reorganized, transferred from the jurisdiction of sports societies to that of the system of education and vice versa.

Separate from these were two national sports universities under government operation: the Leningrad and Moscow Sports Institutes, which were the major sports institutions for adult level national athletes.

==Olympic Reserve specialized (complex) schools==
After the USSR joined as a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1951, Specialized Children and Youth (Sports) Schools of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-ru|Специализированная Детско-Юношеская (Спортивная) Школа Олимпийского Резерва, СДЮ(С)ШОР}}) began to be opened to prepare young athletes for the sports of highest achievements. The number of such sports schools grew, as did the number of sports disciplines within sports schools. They included not only [[Olympic sports]], but also national sports disciplines as well as tourism, [[orienteering]], and other sports. As an alternative there is also Complex Specialized Children and Youth School of the Olympic Reserve ({{lang-uk|Комплексна Спеціалізована Дитячо-Юнацька Школа Олімпійського Резерву, КСДЮШОР}}).

==Schools of Higher Sports Mastery==
Aside of regular sports schools and specialized schools of Olympic Reserve, there are also schools of higher sports mastery ({{lang-uk|Школа вищої спортивної майстерності, ШВСМ}}).

== Regional boarding schools of sports profile (Schools of Olympic Reserve) ==

Before 1989 in the Soviet Union existed a network of regional boarding schools of sports profile ({{lang-ru|ОШИСП, Областная школа-интернат спортивного профиля}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov&gt;Fiskalov, V. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61v3CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT401&amp;lpg=PT401&amp;dq=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1tivxxnwZs&amp;sig=-L-j0EU0BvhDVvgcD6qBOgdXt-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4p9qgmYraAhWJ24MKHdDjA0cQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%9F&amp;f=false Theoretical foundations and organization of athlete training (Теоретические основы и организация подготовки спортсменов)''. Litres, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Children live, study and receive advanced sports training there. Sports boarding schools can be either one-sport-oriented or multisports. In those schools children spend most of their time off studying practicing sports or perfecting certain skills. In 1989 all sports boarding schools were converted to schools of Olympic Reserve, UOR ({{lang-ru|училище олимпийского резерва, УОР}}).&lt;ref name=fiskalov/&gt;

==Structure==
Sports schools were compatible with the administrative division of the country: there were District, City, Oblast, Central, Republican sports schools. To enter sports school, a child could have a recommendation from one's secondary school; children were also invited to come into a certain sports school for the selection during lessons in an ordinary school, or they could come for the selection on their own initiative. In accordance with specifics of different sports disciplines, the age of children and youth admitted into a sports school was between 8 and 14. Groups were organized according to [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|ranks of athletes]]: there were separate groups for Second-Class Junior Sportsmen, First-Class Junior Sportsmen, Second-Class Sportsmen, First-Class Sportsmen, Candidates for Master of Sports of the USSR, Masters of Sports of the USSR. Term of study in each group was one to two years, with different sports normatives applied in each year.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

==Popularity==
By 1971 there were 3,813 sports schools in the USSR, with some 1.3 million children and youth training there. These included 2,434 schools with one million attendees under the jurisdiction of the system of education and 1,245 schools with 340,000 attendees functioning in the system of sports societies.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd ed., [http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00022/84400.htm entry on sports schools]&lt;/ref&gt; And by 1991, some 6,000 sports schools functioned in the USSR.

== Criticism ==

Sports schools, especially the Olympic reserve ones have been in the spotlight of several scandals related to child abuse. In their strive to get the best out of children, a lot of coaches resort to verbal abuse as well as severe and sometimes sadistic physical punishments. The situation is even worse in sports boarding schools where parents exercise little control and children are fully under the coaches' authority.

Another disadvantage of this system is that much more attention is paid to sports than school education. Sports boarding schools of Olympic reserve received the sarcastic nickname "hit-and-run" ({{lang-ru|бей-беги}}; not be confused with a traffic accident or a baseball play), meaning that children mostly hit footballs and ran around sports fields instead of studying.

==Sports schools in post-Soviet states==
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]], the system of children and youth sports in Russia passed through difficult times, but managed to retain the network of sports schools, and Physical Training Clubs (DYuKFP) were created in addition to them.

In 2005 some 4,951 sports schools and DYuKFPs functioned in the system of education and in the system of Rossport. To the former belonged 2,944 institutions of physical culture and sports education: 1,917 sports schools, 464 Specialized sports schools of the Olympic Reserve, 556 DYuKFPs and 7 centers for physical culture. Only sports schools of the system of education were attended by some 2 million children and youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716060824/http://www.ed.gov.ru/files/materials/1635/Sved_ob_uchregd.doc |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had more than 13,000 departments in 122 sports disciplines. Rossport institutions were attended by some one million young athletes.

Soviet experience of mass children and youth sports education was applied by Eastern Europe an countries, in particular East Germany, where they were called ''Kinder- und Jugendsportschule (KJS)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naul | first = Roland |author2=Hardman, Ken | title = Sport and Physical Education in Germany | pages = 61 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=suitable+entry+children+youth+KJS | isbn = 0-419-25390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[Katarina Witt]] and [[Sven Fischer]] attended such schools. Similar sports schools were established in the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]] (called Schools for Sports Initiation there),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  Rhoden | first = William C. | title = PAN AMERICAN GAMES; The Secret of Cuba's Sports Success?

At the present time some 3,000 sports schools exist in the People's Republic of China, including full-time ones, and this system is essentially based on the powerful system of sports schools of the USSR.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;

There are a number of sports schools in Asian countries. These include [[Singapore Sports School]] in Singapore and [[Bukit Jalil Sports School]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. Both of these  schools were established after end of the Soviet Union (1991).

The '''Sunbury Research Centre''' -- also known as ICBT Sunbury -- is a main [[research institute]] of [[BP]] in north-east [[Surrey]].

==History==
It began in 1917 as the Sunbury Research Station. Research began with the employment of two chemists to look into the [[viscosity]] of [[fuel oil]] for the [[Navy]] in the [[First World War]], and the production of [[toluene]]. In the 1920s research took place into [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]], at the plant at [[Uphall]] in [[Scotland]] ([[West Lothian]]). The first new building opened in July 1931. 76 staff were there in 1929, 99 in 1934 and 197 in 1939. 

By the 1950s, BP Research was in a 39-acre site in Sunbury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yl2uvI_5Dt0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27 New Scientist November 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] research had also taken place at [[Kirklington Hall Research Station]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], until 1957. Around 1958, the site was expanded with a new Physics laboratory and five other buildings. A [[linear particle accelerator|Linear electron accelerator]] was installed. By early 1958, Kirklington Hall had been sold.

Products that the [[British Petroleum Company]] made in the 1950s were BP Motor Spirit and BP [[Energol]] (''visco-static'' [[motor oil]]). But Britain would not produce much oil of its own until the mid-1970s when [[North Sea oil]] arrived at the [[Forties Oil Field]]. 

===Construction===
Three new buildings were built from 1998 as part of Phase 1. Since 2001, four new buildings were built as part of Phase 2.

==Structure==
It is situated off the [[A244 road|A244]] (via the [[A308 road|A308]]) in the north of [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], and Surrey, on the Surrey boundary with London. To the east nearby is Sunbury Common.

The retail division of BP UK is at [[Witan Gate House]]. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK.

It has an [[enhanced oil recovery]] [[laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/bp-magazine/bp-magazine-2014-issue-2.pdf BP Magazine 2014 Issue 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Syngas fermentation''', also known as '''synthesis gas fermentation''', is a microbial process.  In this process, a mixture of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[carbon dioxide]], known as [[syngas]], is used as [[carbon]] and [[energy]] sources, and then converted into [[fuel]] and [[chemicals]] by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main products of syngas [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] include [[ethanol]], [[butanol]], [[acetic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and [[methane]].&lt;ref name="Worden"&gt;Worden, R.M., Bredwell, M.D., and Grethlein, A.J. (1997). Engineering issues in synthesis gas fermentations, Fuels and Chemicals from Biomass. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society, 321-335&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain industrial processes, such as petroleum refining, steel milling, and methods for producing [[carbon black]], [[Petroleum coke|coke]], [[ammonia]], and [[methanol]], discharge enormous amounts of waste gases containing mainly CO and {{chem|H|2}} into the atmosphere either directly or through combustion. Biocatalysts can be exploited to convert these waste gases to chemicals and fuels as, for example, ethanol.&lt;ref name="Abubackar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bbb.256 | last1 = Abubackar | first1 = H.N. | last2 = Veiga | first2 = M.

There are several microorganisms, which can produce fuels and chemicals by syngas utilization. These microorganisms are mostly known as [[acetogens]] including ''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'',&lt;ref name="Klasson"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0141-0229(92)90033-K | last1 = Klasson | first1 = K.T. | last2 = Ackerson | first2 = M.

Syngas fermentation process has advantages over a [[chemical process]] since it takes places at lower [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], has higher [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] [[Chemical specificity|specificity]], tolerates higher amounts of [[sulfur]] compounds, and does not require a specific ratio of CO to {{chem|H|2}}.&lt;ref name="Worden" /&gt; On the other hand, syngas fermentation has limitations such as:

'''''The Joy of Sex''''' is an illustrated [[sex manual]] by British author [[Alex Comfort]]. First published in 1972, an updated edition was released in September 2008.

==Overview==
[[File:Joyofsezx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A later cover, with an illustration showing the "bearded man"]]

''The Joy of Sex'' spent eleven weeks at the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] and more than 70 weeks in the top five (1972–1974).&lt;ref&gt;John Bear, ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intention was to use the same approach as such cook books as ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'', hence section titles include "starters" and "main courses". The book features sexual practices such as [[oral sex]] and various [[List of sex positions|sex position]]s as well as bringing "further out" practices such as [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] and [[swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] to the attention of the general public.

The original version was illustrated with a mixture of classical Indian and Japanese erotica and specially commissioned illustrations by [[Chris Foss]] (black-and-white line drawings) and Charles Raymond (colour paintings). These two artists based their work on photographs taken by Chris Foss, of Charles Raymond and his wife. The illustrations have become somewhat dated, mainly because of changes in hairstyles. Both the illustrations and text are titillating as well as illustrative, in contrast to the bland, clinical style of earlier books about sex. More recent editions feature new artwork, and added text emphasizing [[safer sex]].

Newer versions have reversed previously-supportive positions on topics such as swinging, due to extensive textual changes made at the height of the 1980s [[AIDS]] panic.

A pocket book version entitled, ''The Joy of Sex, the Pocket Edition'' was also published. The book won the [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burkardt |first=John |url=http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html |title=The Oddest Book Titles |publisher=John Burkardt |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310190018/http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html |archivedate=2008-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Joy of Sex'' did not address [[Homosexual sexual practices|homosexual sex]] beyond a definitional level.  Though there was a careful (for the day) treatment of bondage, other [[BDSM]] activities received definitional coverage at best. The book played a notable part in the [[Sexual revolution#Nonfiction sex manuals|sexual revolution]].

In 1984, [[National Lampoon's Joy of Sex|a film]] loosely based on the book was released.

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over ''The Joy of Sex'' in the United States.  Religious groups have fought to keep it out of [[public libraries]].  In March 2008, the [[Nampa, Idaho]] public library board ruled in favor of removing ''The Joy of Sex'' and ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' from the libraries' shelves, making them only available upon request in the library director's office.  The books were restored to shelves in September 2008 in response to [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] threats of litigation.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.idahostatesman.com/166/story/497414.html Nampa library restores 'Joy of Sex' books].  Kristin Rodine.  Retrieved on 2008-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated 2008 edition==
Publisher Mitchell Beazley released an updated edition of the book in September 2008. The new edition was rewritten and reinvented by relationship psychologist [[Susan Quilliam]] and approved by Nicholas Comfort, the original author's son.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Davies. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/10/healthandwellbeing.familyandrelationships "Joy of Sex gets makeover for generation that found Viagra"].  ''[[The Observer]]'', February 10, 2008. Accessed 30 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

More material has been added to the book, and the remaining text has been rewritten from both a factual and psychological viewpoint to take into account social shifts since 1972. The new edition presents a more balanced female/male perspective and also contains 120 completely re-shot photographs and re-drawn illustrations.

The quirky style—and the message of the book, that sex is fun—remain the same. Mitchell Beazley has marketed the ''New Joy'' with the subtitle "a thinking person's guide to sex".

The '''University of Talca''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Talca}}) is a [[Chile]]an [[university]] located in the cities of [[Talca]], [[Curicó]], [[Linares, Chile|Linares]], [[Santa Cruz, Chile|Santa Cruz]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Its headquarters and largest campus are located in the city of Talca. It is part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities]], the [[:es:Consorcio_de_Universidades_del_Estado_de_Chile|Consortium of State Universities]]  and the [[:es:Agrupación_de_Universidades_Regionales_de_Chile|Group of Regional Universities of Chile]]. 

University of Talca is considered as the best public university outside Santiago by various rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utalca.cl/link.cgi//SalaPrensa/Institucional/12083|title=UTALCA: ENTRE LAS 3 MEJORES PÚBLICAS DEL PAÍS Y EN SELECTO GRUPO DE “INSTITUCIONES COMPLEJAS”|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers ten PhD programs and 27 Master programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utalca.cl/english/#/english/|title=UTalca English|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was accredited for five years (2014-2019) by the [[:es:Comisión_Nacional_de_Acreditación|Comisión Nacional de Acreditación]] (National Accreditation Commission).  

== History ==

The Universidad de Talca was founded in 1981, upon the fusion of the seats in Talca of the [[Universidad de Chile]] and the [[Universidad Técnica del Estado]]. For this reason it is known in the Chilean system as a "derivative university". In 1998, the [[Facultad de Ingeniería|Faculty of Engineering]] was founded and established in the city of [[Curicó]], 60&amp;nbsp;km north of Talca. The university has expanded to other cities in recent years: Santiago in 2005, where a new campus was inaugurated in 2013, a ''Technological Institute'' in [[Santa Cruz, Chile|Santa Cruz]] in 2007, and a campus in [[Linares, Chile|Linares]], in 2017. 

== Organization ==

The university has five campuses. 

* '''Campus Talca (''Campus Lircay)''''' 

Located in northern Talca, it is the largest university campus, with an extension of more than 90 hectares. It hosts the buildings of the faculties of Health Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Economics and Business Sciences and Law and Social Sciences. Other Institutes, Schools, Vice-Presidencies, Technological Centers and various other agencies and administrative services are distributed in the campus as well. Here are also found a Sculptures Park, including part of the National Museum of Sculpture, and the Botanical Garden (6.5 hectares).

* '''Campus Curico (''Campus Los Niches)'''''

It is located in the Los Niches sector, to the South-East of the city of Curicó, 50 km north of Talca, and concentrates the programs of the Department of Engineering: Industrial Civil Engineering (day and evening), Computer Sciences Civil Engineering, Mechanical Technical Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering, Construction Engineering and Civil Engineering in Mines. Postgraduate programs are also offered.

* '''Campus Santiago'''

The Santiago Campus emerged as a space to promote the development of graduate programs of academic excellence and to train highly qualified human resources. In its building at 415 Quebec Street, Providencia district, are located the study premises attached to the Department of Law and Social Sciences and to the Business School, various graduate programs are taught and an exhibition gallery operates. On the new campus building at 2222 Santa Elena, the undergraduate programs are concentrated: Auditing and Control Management Engineering, Business Engineering, Law and Political Sciences and Public Administration.

* '''Campus Colchagua''' 

It is located in the city of Santa Cruz and was created by the joint effort of a group of businessmen from the O'Higgins Region and the Universidad de Talca to develop a project linked to the needs of regional development. It is an academic unit devoted to training Professional Technicians, continuing education for professional and research and development for the regional and national productive sector in strategic areas related to the wine industry.

* '''Campus Linares''' 

It was inaugurated in 2017 and it host the Faculty of Education Sciences and offers also the undergraduate program on Public Auditor-Accountant. Its modern facilities have 6 300 squares meters.

The '''W. M. Keck Observatory''' is a two-telescope [[astronomical observatory]] at an elevation of 4,145 meters (13,600&amp;nbsp;ft) near the summit of [[Mauna Kea]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]]. Both telescopes feature {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} primary mirrors, currently among the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest astronomical telescopes]] in use. 

== Overview ==
With a concept first proposed in 1977, telescope designers at the [[University of California]] (Terry Mast) and [[Lawrence Berkeley Labs]] ([[Jerry Nelson (astronomer)|Jerry Nelson]]) had been developing the technology necessary to build a large, ground-based telescope. With a design in hand, a search for the funding began. In 1985, [[Howard B. Keck]] of the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] gave $70 million to fund the construction of the Keck&amp;nbsp;I telescope. Construction of Keck I began in September 1985, with first light occurring on 24 November 1990 using only nine of the eventual 36 segments. With construction of the first telescope well advanced, further donations allowed the construction of a second telescope starting in 1991. The Keck&amp;nbsp;I telescope began science observations in May 1993, while first light for Keck II occurred on October 23, 1996.

[[Image:KeckObservatory20071013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|The Keck II telescope showing the [[Segmented mirror|segmented]] primary mirror]]

The key advance that allowed the construction of the Keck Observatory's large telescopes was the ability to operate smaller [[Segmented mirror|mirror segments]] as a single, contiguous mirror. In the case of the Keck Observatory telescopes each of the primary mirrors is composed of 36 hexagonal segments that work together as a single unit. Each segment is 1.8 meters wide, 7.5 centimeters thick, and weighs half a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keck Revolution in Telescope Design Pioneered at Lawrence Berkeley Lab |author=Lynn Yarris |date=1992 |url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/keck-telescope.html |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mirrors were made from [[Zerodur]] [[glass-ceramic]] by the German company [[Schott AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schott.com/ft/german/download/zeak13_fb0309.pdf |title=ZERODUR for Large Segmented Telescopes |publisher=SCHOTT Glas|author=Hans F. Morian|author2=Peter Hartmann|author3=Ralf Jedamzik|author4=Hartmut W. Höneß}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the telescope, each segment is kept stable by a system of [[active optics]], which uses extremely rigid support structures in combination with three actuators under each segment. During observation, the computer-controlled system of sensors and actuators adjusts the position of each segment, relative to its neighbors, to an accuracy of four [[nanometer]]s. This twice-per-second adjustment counters the effect of gravity as the telescope moves, in addition to other environmental and structural effects that can affect the mirror shape.

Each Keck Observatory telescope sits on an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] mount. Most current 8–10 m class telescopes use altazimuth designs due to the reduced structural requirements compared to older [[Equatorial mount|equatorial designs]]. This mounting style provides the greatest strength and stiffness for the least amount of steel, which, for Keck Observatory, totals about 270&amp;nbsp;tons per telescope. The total weight of each telescope is more than 300&amp;nbsp;tons. Two of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope|proposed designs]] for the next generation 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;m telescopes use the same basic technology pioneered at Keck Observatory, a hexagonal mirror array coupled with an altazimuth mounting.

The primary mirrors of each of the two telescopes are 10 meters (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft or 394&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter, slightly smaller than the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]]. However, all of the light collected by the Keck Observatory primary mirrors (75.76&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is sent to the secondary mirror and the instruments, compared to GTC's primary mirror, which has an effective light-collection area of 73.4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 25.4 square feet less than each of the Keck Observatory primary mirrors. Because of this fundamental difference in design, Keck Observatory's telescopes arguably remain the largest steerable, optical/infrared telescopes on Earth.

The telescopes are equipped with a suite of instruments, both [[camera]]s and [[spectrometers]] that allow observations across much of the visible and near infrared spectrum.

== Management ==

The Keck Observatory is managed by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, a non-profit [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] organization whose board of directors includes representatives from [[Caltech]] and the [[University of California]]. Construction of the telescopes was made possible through private grants totaling more than $140 million provided by the W. M. Keck Foundation. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]] joined the partnership in October 1996, at the time Keck&amp;nbsp;II commenced observations.

Telescope time is allocated by the partner institutions. Caltech, the University of Hawaii System, and the University of California accept proposals from their own researchers. NASA accepts proposals from researchers based in the United States.

[[Jerry Nelson (astronomer)|Jerry Nelson]] was the project scientist for the Keck Telescope, and he also contributed to later multi-mirror projects until he died in June 2017. Nelson was behind one of the key innovations of the Keck telescope, the use of multiple thin segments acting as one mirror to provide the reflecting surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/in-memoriam-jerry-nelson-legendary-telescope-designer/|title=In Memoriam: Jerry Nelson, Legendary Telescope Designer|last=Lewis|first=Hilton|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==

; MOSFIRE : MOSFIRE (''Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irlab.astro.ucla.edu/mosfire/|title=MOSFIRE science based capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a third generation instrument for the W. M. Keck Observatory. MOSFIRE was delivered to Keck Observatory on February 8, 2012 and first light on the Keck I telescope was obtained on April 4, 2012. A Multi-Object [[Spectrograph]] For Infra-Red Exploration and wide-field camera for the near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 μm), MOSFIRE's special feature is the cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit (CSU) that is reconfigurable under remote control in less than 6 minutes without any thermal cycling. Bars move in from each side to form up to 46 short slits. When the bars are removed MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. The instrument was developed by teams from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]), the California Institute of Technology ([[Caltech]]) and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], (UCSC). The Co- Principal Investigators are Ian S. McLean ([[UCLA]]) and [[Charles C. Steidel]] (Caltech), and the project was managed by WMKO Instrument Program Manager, Sean Adkins. MOSFIRE was funded in part by the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), which is operated by AURA and funded by the National Science Foundation, and by a private donation to WMKO by Gordon and Betty Moore.&lt;ref&gt;http://irlab.astro.ucla.edu/mosfire/84460J.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
; DEIMOS : The Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object [[Spectrograph]] is capable of gathering spectra from 130 galaxies or more in a single exposure. In "Mega Mask" mode, DEIMOS can take spectra of more than 1,200 objects at once, using a special narrow-band filter.
; HIRES : The largest and most mechanically complex of the Keck Observatory's main instruments, the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer breaks up incoming light into its component colors to measure the precise intensity of each of thousands of color channels. Its spectral capabilities have resulted in many breakthrough discoveries, such as the detection of planets outside our solar system and direct evidence for a model of the [[Big Bang]] theory. This instrument has detected more [[extrasolar planets]] than any other in the world. The radial velocity precision is up to one meter per second (1.0&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/fop/ |title=Kepler Discoveries - About Follow-up Observations |publisher=[[NASA]]|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument detection limit at 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] is {{Jupiter mass|link=y|0.2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/4-AHoward.ppt |title=The NASA-UC Eta-Earth Survey At Keck Observatory |date=2010-10-16 |publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2015-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704072607/http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/4-AHoward.ppt |archivedate=2011-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; KCWI : The Keck Cosmic Web Imager is an [[integral field spectrograph]] operating at wavelengths between 350 and 560 [[Nanometre|nm]].
; LRIS : The Low Resolution Imaging [[Spectrograph]] is a faint-light instrument capable of taking spectra and images of the most distant known objects in the universe. The instrument is equipped with a red arm and a blue arm to explore stellar populations of distant galaxies, [[active galactic nuclei]], [[galactic cluster]]s, and [[quasar]]s.
; LWS: The Long Wavelength Spectrometer for the Keck I telescope is and imaging, grating spectrometer working in the wavelength range of 3-25 micros. Like NIRC, the LWS was a forward-CASS instrument, and was used for studying cometary, planetary, and extragalactic objects.  The LWS is now retired from science observations.
; NIRC : The Near Infrared Camera for the Keck I telescope is so sensitive it could detect the equivalent of a single candle flame on the [[Moon]]. This sensitivity makes it ideal for ultra-deep studies of galactic formation and evolution, the search for [[galaxy formation and evolution|proto-galaxies]] and images of quasar environments. It has provided ground-breaking studies of the Galactic center, and is also used to study [[protoplanetary disk]]s, and high-mass [[star formation|star-forming regions]]. NIRC was retired from science observations in 2010.
; NIRC-2 : The second generation Near Infrared Camera works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system to produce the highest-resolution ground-based images and spectroscopy in the 1–5 micrometers (µm) range. Typical programs include mapping surface features on [[Solar System]] bodies, searching for planets around other stars, and analyzing the morphology of remote galaxies.
; NIRES : The Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer is a spectrograph that provides simultaneous coverage of wavelengths from 0.94 to 2.45 [[micron]]s.
; NIRSPEC : The Near Infrared Spectrometer studies very [[Redshift#Observations in astronomy|high redshift]] [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], the motions and types of stars located near the [[Galactic Center]], the nature of [[brown dwarf]]s, the nuclear regions of dusty starburst galaxies, active galactic nuclei, [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] chemistry, [[star|stellar]] physics, and Solar System science.
; [[OH-Suppressing Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph|OSIRIS]] : The OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph is a [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared spectrograph]] for use with the Keck&amp;nbsp;I adaptive optics system. OSIRIS takes spectra in a small field of view to provide a series of images at different wavelengths. The instrument allows astronomers to ignore wavelengths where the [[Earth's atmosphere]] shines brightly due to emission from OH ([[hydroxyl]]) molecules, thus allowing the detection of objects 10 times fainter than previously available. Originally installed on Keck II, in January, 2012 OSIRIS was moved to the Keck 1 telescope.
; Keck Interferometer : The Interferometer allowed the light from both Keck telescopes to be combined into an {{convert|85|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline, near infrared, optical [[Optical interferometer|interferometer]]. This long baseline gave the interferometer an effective [[angular resolution]] of 5 [[milliarcsecond|milliarcseconds (mas)]] at 2.2&amp;nbsp;µm, and 24&amp;nbsp;mas at 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Several back-end instruments allowed the interferometer to operate in a variety of modes, operating in H, K, and L-band near infrared, as well as [[nulling interferometry]]. As of mid-2012 the Keck Interferometer has been discontinued for lack of funding. The instrument is currently in mothballed status and could be reactivated if funding permits.

Both Keck Observatory telescopes are equipped with [[laser guide star]] [[adaptive optics]], which compensates for the blurring due to [[astronomical seeing|atmospheric turbulence]]. The first AO system operational on a large telescope, the equipment has been constantly upgraded to expand the capability.

[[File:WAM pied girl.jpg|thumb|A woman who has been pied]]

'''Wet and messy fetish (WAM)''', also known as '''sploshing''', is a form of [[sexual fetishism]] whereby a person becomes aroused when copious amounts of a substance are applied to the naked skin, face, or to clothing.{{r|Gates (2000)}} Several dozen websites are dedicated to WAM.

Many people with WAM fetishes are drawn to the tactile sensations of wet or messy substances against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the visual appeal of others getting wet or messy with products that have different textures, consistencies and colours. A subject will often be [[pieing|pelted with cream pies]] (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.

Messy substances most commonly focused on by WAM participants include whipped cream, raw eggs, milk, lotion (see [[lotion play]]), paint, oil, mud, pudding, chocolate sauce, fruit juice, beer, shaving foam, custard, baked beans, [[treacle]], ketchup, ice cream, peanut butter, [[gunge|slime]], and cake batter, among others.

A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, and [[Female ejaculation|female ejaculate]] is not considered part of WAM. The former three are typically considered [[coprophilia]], [[urophilia]], and [[emetophilia]]; urophilia is somewhat commonly found in mainstream pornography.{{r|Gates (2000)}} The later two are also somewhat mainstream.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

WAM fetish videos (made by both fans and commercial producers) may include nudity and sexual acts, while others may only feature fully clothed participants. Videos can frequently be seen on public video hosting sites like YouTube. Some of these videos are flagged but most of them remain available despite the sexual undertones, mainly because a large majority of wet and messy videos posted publicly do not include nudity and are therefore considered suitable for all audiences to view. Indeed, not only is much WAM video content indistinguishable in any easily defined sense from the kind of [[slapstick]] featured in mainstream entertainment, but scenes of slimings or pieings from the mainstream media are often compiled and marketed by producers towards a WAM fetishist target audience.

==Crossover with other fetishes==
There is some crossover between the wet and messy fetish and clothing destruction fetishes. Some WAM productions will see models start out fully dressed, usually in quite smart outfits such as formal dresses or suits; they will then be covered in messy substances, after which their messy clothes are cut up, typically with scissors, leaving them naked or nearly so.

WAM is sometimes also combined with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], where a subject is first restrained or chained up and then hosed down or messed up.  Wet and Messy fetishism lends itself well to domination/submission role-playing. 

"Cake Sitting" (the act of deliberately sitting on a large cake or gateaux, either clothed or nude) is often considered a sub-fetish in its own right, but may be linked to the [[crush fetish]].  While participants who sit on cakes for pleasure will do so for the tactile sensory experience, or as part of submissive role-playing, those who enjoy watching the act will often focus specifically on the crushing of the dessert as a visual stimulus for a sexual reaction.

==Psychology==
No conclusive research has been conducted into the psychology behind the fetish; however, it is not uncommon for fetishists to have had interest in the sensations of messy play since their formative years (age 3–4) with a sexual element manifesting with the onset of puberty. For many, the simple breaking of taboos—doing what one was told not to as a child—brings about a sense of personal liberation. In any form, the fetish is about sensual stimulation, whether visual, tactile, or otherwise.

One unproven theory is that individuals drawn to WAM have [[sensory processing disorder|low tactile sensitivity]], which is increased and intensified by wet substances acting as a lubricant under applied pressure or friction. "Messy play" is a common clinical therapy used in treating hypo-tactile patients (mostly pediatric cases) to give them an outlet and appropriate time and place to engage in mess-making.{{r|Kranowitz (2007)}}

Another aspect is the link to other fetishes, as some wet and messy play is done in a submissive or dominating way and has possible links to BDSM, the emphasis being on the humiliation of the victim, although this is often mitigated or negated by the victim taking it in good humour. The dominant partner inflicting the mess can also be an object of attraction as an assertive figure of playful mischief.

==In media==
The popular sex column ''[[Savage Love]]'' has mentioned WAM. In one article, there was a reply to a letter from the roommate of someone who masturbates with condiments, possibly for fetishistic purposes. [[Dan Savage|Daniel Savage]], the writer of ''Savage Love,'' did not condemn the use of condiments in that incident, but, instead, only chided the fetishist for using condiments that were later used by others.{{r|Savage (2004)}}
